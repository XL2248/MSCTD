With this asshole?
Two guys walk in, one walks out.
I'm not happy about it either, okay? At all.
But, for now, it's done.
You're on admin leave until they make a determination on the battery...
Everybody from Chief Soto to the FBI to the whole goddamn world
What do you mean?
Just something I saw on oil projects in Saudi.
Rather than guard every project,
Hang on, what?
They had built-in accelerometers
When it got in range of a cell tower, it would start phoning home.
This looks a lot like the same thing.
Did the Hunters put a cell-based tracker
Uh... . I don't know. The wife might've done.
Hey. listen, can you check with a cell phone company,
Yeah, all right, call me back.
Are they gonna run it down?
Hopefully. I'm not allowed near it for now.
But, Christ, Jenny, that's amazing.
Have you named him yet?
Well, if he had a name, he'd be mine.
What is it?
Hey. Hey, wake up.
Wake up.
Shit.
The last few hits have been near Calumet.
It must be far from the tower
Takes in half the storage areas south of the city.
Nobody's got the manpower to search that many storage yards.
And with the ATF on the fire and Kunz's undetermined call,
Look, to hell with downtown and the feds.
Orders or not,
We're here to help you finish this, Sean.
There's something I gotta do first.
Thanks.
A cat fall on your head?
Did you bring the sugar?
No, I didn't bring you sugar.
I just came here for one thing.
You're so mean.
I'm sorry about your Uncle Brian.
Sean, no!
No! I have a reputation.
I just talked to them about the dragon.
Okay, so how were they gonna
Package?
Why would they talk to me about that?
Because the language of these people is fire, right?
Oh. They don't speak the language of fire.
Not like we do.
Yeah, you and I don't speak the same language.
Oh, come on, Sean. Of course we do.
You love to speak with the dragon. So do I.
And the dragon loves to speak with us, and you know it.
You would be seeing another you.
Hi, another me.
All right, look, just level with me.
How are they getting the package out of Chicago?
I don't know anything about a package.
Nothing. Okay?
But I will share a story with you,
God damn it.
Listen to me, you son of a bitch,
All right. What story?
Two guys walk into a building, one walks out.
So, I grabbed a gardener's can of mixed fuel,
But enough that both fires turned on each other, away from the building
Done.
And yet Wicek was still consumed.
Yeah. He was.
So here's my question.
What did you feel when Wicek caught fire?
Did you want him to burn?
Did you want to burn them all?
You have no idea.
Oh. Oh, believe me.
I do.
I do. I do. Sean.
Those two men with the pretend names,
Okay. What location?
Given the Kelvin required for ignition was minimal.
Given the constraint of mixed fuel.
That's what the man said.
Ah. Oh, you'll need to find a battery for it, and I was never here.
Thank you.
Just keep those dead kids off my desk, huh?
Shipping to Nigeria?
There you are.
A lot of people looking for you.
Come on, come on, come on.
What the hell are you doing. Sean?
Surprise, surprise. No diversion blast today.
They're not just gonna let us drive through with the goddamn load.
Hey! Show me your hands! Show me your fucking hands!
Now, get out the fucking truck. Go! Move!
Come on! Show me your fucking hands.
Walk towards me slowly. Slowly.
Keep coming. Walk towards me. Walk towards me!
Down, down, down. Down.
Keep those hands where I can see them.
Tank's not gonna blow today, asshole.
You're both under arrest...
Stop!
In your backpack. State Invitationals already, huh?
Yep. You're up for carpool.
Okay.
Have you ever seen AIDS?
Mom doesn't see human patients.
Besides, Tammy's mom says that all the AIDS are in New York...
Um, Tammy's mom believes that Falcon Crest is a real place.
Let's just stick to science, okay?
Facts only.
We do have vials of HIV,
Actually hard to contract.
You've seen something worse?
Jason, don't worry about what you're seeing on TV.
I work in one of the safest places in the world.
Come on, we're gonna be late.
Morning, ma'am.
Have a good day
Hey.
Morning.
Ah, what do we have here?
Who would drop a package off looking like that?
Hazleton.
Those research monkey guys?
Yep. Well, hello, Monkey 053.
Wow. It just gets better.
It looks like a spleen.
Let's see what brought you in here today.
What's wrong?
It's not just a spleen, it's...
uh, a blood clot, I think.
I'm guessing from subcutaneous hemorrhaging.
What would cause that?
The virus, a powerful one.
And, if this is a primate, it's probably SHF.
Uh, sorry. Peter's the virus guy.
Simian Hemorrhagic Fever.
Highly contagious.
Where ever this guy came from,
Oh, you're safe.
It rips the hell out of the inside of monkeys,
We'll make a few cultures, see what's going on.
If this monkey has Simian Fever, you're looking for
Dead monkeys make me sad.
I never know how to decipher your level of sarcasm.
Well, I guess I'd put us at a..
kind of like a Level 3?
Not really the pun type, Jahrling.
Stick with acerbic.
Romeo, Bravo, Lima, Fort.
Code Three. Medical tear, lock two.
Ma'am, are you all right?
Whatever it is, it didn't get me.
Just check the glove.
The cut was there before, but I..
I'm observing blood in the powder.
What the hell were you thinking?
Sir, we have a duty to warn Hazleton.
Why'd you go in there with a cut?
I don't even know where to start.
You can get as angry as you want at me later,
No, because I was using a fresh sample.
Well, there you go.
I mean, how can you be 100% sure?
I already have the lab
Colonel, weeks ago, I asked Hazleton to send me samples
The package was for my study.
The cells blew up because they were infected.
I've already told Hazleton that it's Simian Fever.
What, you really think Coco Jr.
in there has two rare and deadly diseases?
Look, what's more likely?
They sent us samples of SHF, which I've been expecting for weeks,
That's reckless.
No, that.. that's experience.
I'm sorry, I'm the only one
Look, enough of this crap, okay?
Ebola?
I'm gonna need unequivocal proof.
I was about to introduce Ebola Zaire to the sample tissue.
I just need to get back in there.
All your samples were compromised during sterilization, ma'am.
It's protocol.
The patient is a 14-year-old male...
All right, one second. Excuse me.
Fourth day back, and I'm already scrubbing in
Well, fantastic!
Yeah.
Can you pick up the kids this afternoon?
I would, but I have to entertain all of them.
I'm not Christina Aguilera.
I can't afford those places, not the good ones.
Let me make some calls for you, please.
Boy...
You are as persistent as you are annoying.
You can walk as fast as you want,
Neither am I.
What is wrong with Callie? She still hasn't called me back.
Ah, the recovery team texted,
Hey, Ross?
Could you run down to the E.R.
and ask Torres if she can pick up the kids today?
We need to get someone from urology down here now.
Don't you think I tried? There's an emergency,
Dr. Wilson, it feels like I might explode.
I don't think he's gonna last 20 minutes.
Dr. Avery, I'm
There is nothing you can say after this morning
I have a giant penis.
Of course, now my mom's convinced that Stephanie
Dude, you and your rich boy problems.
You know what the worst part is?
I think she actually likes Stephanie.
Well, so then you need to tell your mom that.
Stand up for your girl.
That wouldn't work. She'd just hate her even more.
So what are you gonna do?
Nothing.
You know, it's like walking into a hornet's nest.
You know, you gotta stay still. Let the whole frenzy die down.
Excuse me.
Sorry. Pardon me.
Who knew dr. Shepherd was such a big shot?
What are you doing here?
You told me to scrub in.
The night of the gala? At your house, remember?
Oh, yeah. That night was so fun.
Yeah. Don't worry. I won't tell anyone what happened.
Hey, um.. it's a little tight in here.
Uh, you could probably be more useful
Oh. Yeah. You're probably right.
Okay, sweet girl, just one more.
It's puppy dog eyes, and I'm not.
These are my regular eyes.
What do you want?
Your dad passed his stress test.
Yang told me to discharge him.
Good.
Say it
But when I come back,
Sorry. I came to see if your drain output picked up
I can come back later.
You're not progressing very quickly here.
They're all in love with you, and afraid of you.
I mean, you pull your strings
You said that you would go if I set it up.
You said that you would go.
No, see, I never said that.
That's against my policy. That's how you screw up.
You tell someone you're gonna do something,
That's how you lose your home..
your family. Make your children hate you.
Look, you're a sweet kid,
But I don't want to let you down, too.
All right?
Okay. got that closed up.
Now let me see. Did I miss anything else?
I don't see anything.
That's what's called a rhetorical question, my dear.
All right, let's take a look at this penis, shall we?
Uh, Dr. Avery, can you elaborate
I'm fascinated by all things penile.
Yes, I saw evidence of that earlier this morning.
How's it looking, dear?
Well, it's possible he's gonna need a skin graft,
Yeah, he'll be able to stick it in a hornet's nest,
wherever they live.
Well, I find that men often put their penises
Suction, dear, come on.
I'm thinking about the patient.
Whoa, dial it back for a second.
Does she have a concussion?
No, she's fine. Are you?
You're gonna be worried about that
She is my patient,
Dr. Bailey knows the procedure.
Sorry.
Probably should have checked back earlier.
Your.. white blood cell count is elevated.
I'd like to start you on antibiotics.
Why do I need antibiotics?
Because there's a left shift?
You need to examine me
Murphy..
After I put you in the cab,
And you didn't answer, so I went to check.
And good thing, because you were passed out
I helped you inside...
And you insisted on having a dance party.
We made the most amazing grilled cheese sandwiches
It was the first time I felt like
Do you really not remember any of it?
I vaguely remember the grilled cheese.
Let's go back to the part where you said I was pretty.
That part?
Excuse me, Dr. Avery. Do you have a minute?
I'm meeting my son, Edwards. It's been a long day.
Danni, 6rab me the ammo!
Hey, yo! What do you need?
I need, 5
Here you go. You got it?
Get the ridge! Get the ridge again! Again!
What up?
Hey, Li, what's up? Aloha, boys.
Hey, guys. What do we got?
A crown for the queen.
Cute
That is disgusting. No, I don't want that.
He's talkin' to you, fool. He keeps takin' my cup.
You're just the man I'm lookin' for. Sir.
like that hat.
Lovely lid, Li.
It's Luau Sunday, sir. It's my party hat.
Well, carry on. Yes, sir.
Walk with me. Yes, sir.
Staff Sergeant Dickson was a good man.
Yes, sir.
Is this allowed, sir?: Ho. Jack Dickson
Sit down.
Your wife, she's expecting, yeah?
How far along is she?
Eight months, sir.
I'm afraid that's one delivery you're gonna have to miss.
Yes, sir. I've been there, I share your pain.
The things we do for the Corps.
Corporal, this job of ours, driving trucks in heavily contested areas,
We lose good men and women every day, don't we?
Yes, sir.
I expect you and your people are wondering
I haven't really had time to think about it yet, sir.
Well, you better give it some thought.
You're the new squad leader.
Major?
Congratulations. You just got yourself another stripe.
Sir, maybe there's someone else. I...
Come again?
Corporal Kettner's an exemplary marine.
He made the short list but you drew the long straw.
Sir, it's just that this is my third deployment in four years.
After it's over, my contract's up.
I'm not sure if I'm going to re-up, sir.
Is my beloved Corps not living up to your expectations?
It's a big decision and my wife and I,
Hey, if it wasn't me, it was you.
So you down for being my alpha team leader?
Hell yeah. A-slash gets the girls, shoots the bad guys.
Squad leader does the paperwork.
Shit.
That's actually true.
Right? Right.
Wow.
Nothing changes, guys.
Everything changes, man.
I can't give you shit anymore.
I love givin' you shit.
Soto, you can still give me shit.
I can just bust your ass for it now.
That's cute.
Well, we said we didn't want an uptight asshole.
Yeah, at least he's not uptight.
Very funny. No, you guys should really laugh it up.
Because once I get my stripes,
Just in case you animals piss me off
You're a toolbox. That's what I can say.
Yeah, but I look good.
You're all right.
Don't deny it.
Now this is definitely outside the Green Zone.
So watch your corners, keep your head on a swivel.
LEDS, HME's, ambushes, whatever.
Questions?
Are we taking route 605, sir?
Affirmative. It's a straight shot 75 clicks,
We're totally fucked.
You got a problem with that, Corporal Kettner?
No, sir! That's good.
This is part of the drawdown handoff
Would you agree with that, Corporal?
Yes, sir! That's fine.
All right, Marines, you stay safe, get the job done.
They're all yours, squadron leader.
Thank you, sir.
Oorah, sir.
All right, Marines, top up your ammo. Let's get ready to roll.
TFaisal. Corporal Merrimette.
Thank you. You'll be riding with Corporal Kettner.
You ride in the back. Go ahead, man.
Go ahead. Go. You speak English?
All right, Li. You look stupid. Thanks.
Corporal!
What's Up, A-slash?
You really gonna let him have a gun?
They let you have one, don't they?
System check. Over. "This is Thunder Ops.
Systems are online and operational. Be safe out there. Over.
Roger that. Out.
Hey, guys. What do you like better,
Chocolate chip. Chocolate chip.
Chocolate chip, only if it's baked hard.
I heard you like it hard.
Okay, pizza or sushi? Sushi!
Por Vida! I love being a marine
Chin up. Yeah. Thanks, buddy.
Thunder Ops, this is Gunmetal 2-5.
We've been waiting here for over two hours.
We're sitting ducks.
Do you have an ETA on the EOD? Over.
Negative, Gunmetal.
They'll get there as soon as they can. Hold tight.
Get back in the fucking truck!
Corporal.
Where the hell is he going?
Private Faisal, where the hell do you think you're going?
Don't worry. I got this. God.
That's why I don't like working with these motherfuckers.
Look at this guy. Take charge, go get him.
Get your ass back in the truck!
Soto, watch him. Roger that.
Make sure he doesn't get his ass killed.
Hey, Muji! What the fuck you doing?
Tell him not to touch a goddamned thing and get his ass back here.
Zou should wait there.
Who do you think you are, John Wayne? Get back in the truck.
I have a visual on a pressure plate to my 12 o'clock.
Stop walking before you blow me up.
Blow you up? What about me?
What about you?
Xes. I see ic.
Wait, what
This is just a car radio.
Maybe it'll play the Beach Boys.
We're cool. He says it's just a car stereo.
What are you doing, man? Are you playing in the sand?
Come on, man.
You tell him to get away from that thing
The radio was just a decoy device.
Leave it alone. Let's go.
It's a HMIE, maybe 40 pounds of bang, maybe more.
So if I trip it,
That's fine for you, right? You got 72 virgins waiting for you, right?
Tell him not to touch a goddamned thing and get his ass back here.
I'm gonna shoot you right in the face, motherfucker.
I swear to God, man, you touch that thing,
Let's go! Let's go! No!
What the fuck did I say?
I told you not to fucking do it!
Yes, sir.
If you ever pull any shit like that again, I'll kill you myself.
You got that, Private?
Yes, Corporal.
Now get in the truck!
Yes, sir.
I told you I got this.
Shut the fuck up, Muji!
Gunmetal 2-5, this is Thunder Ops, over.
Roger, Thunder Ops, this is Gunmetal 2-5.
Send your traffic. Over.
What's your ETA to FOB Ouellette?: Over.
07 clicks over rough terrain. Two hours Max, over.
Roger that, Gunmetal 2-5. Thunder Ops out.
Google it.
It means caveman
What are you rocking downstairs, baby girl?
You couldn't handle what I'm rocking downstairs, mama's boy.
Come on, Danni, you gotta give us a little something something.
What are you rocking downstairs?
Full '70s style? Bermuda triangle?
Landing strip? Bald eagle?
Come on, leave my bush outta this conversation.
I got a hardwood floor with a Queen Christina.
What's a Queen Christina?
Hey, what about you, Soto?
You look like a pretty hairy guy. You trim the hedge?
Come on, Soto, you can tell me.
You squeaky clean down there?
Danni? Call in QRF. Let's get these guys a chopper to the Green Zone.
Thunder Ops, this is Gunmetal 2-5. Over.
Listen to me, keep trying. This valley's shit, you understand?
Hey, Coop? Let's go, move!
Thunder Ops, this is Gunmetal 2-5. Over.
Iet's roll
Get the hell outta here!
Go, go, go!
Thanks for saving our ass, Corporal. No problem.
We need to get her outta this valley ASAF.
Thunder Ops, this is Gunmetal 2-5. Over.
I repeat, Thunder Ops, this is Gunmetal 2-5. Over.
We got no talk. Just keep trying
What's that right there? What's that there?
Hey, I got movement at my 3 o'clock.
What the hell!
Shit!
What the hell!
Get up on the fucking .50 Cal!
Thunder Ops, this is Gunmetal 2-5.
We're taking heavy fire in the vicinity
Soto, get your ass back up there!
Get on the goddamned .50! Gunmetal 2-5.
They're shooting, Soto, you get on that .50 Cal.
Son of a bitch! I can't do it.
Odin?
A Norse god? He's cool
Would you maybe want to make a trade?
I know a kid who would love that board
Here, come here and check it out.
and Warlocks. "
Yeah. I just had to... I just left.
Did you get kicked out?
No, I just needed to leave.
Just the atmosphere.
And the cups.
Hey, I was right on Sean's trail.
"Strong little man."
in, like, 40 Arabic countries.
And "Buzkashi" is "goat hockey"...
in Central Asia
So, you said that you left Papa John's because of the cups?
Is there something I should be aware of as a customer?
It stays on.
I'm just going to get out.
Hey, Mom. Hi, honey.
Walter, you got to tip these guys.
We got the piano back safe, Mom.
Are you back from your work trip?
Yeah, this morning
Hey, tipping time now.
This is all I got
All right, thanks, everybody.
For all your hard work.
We appreciate it, ma'am.
You did great. You just let yourself out.
He's good for this.
Are you gonna stay for dinner?
Oh, Mom, I'd love to.
I think I'm just really wiped out after supervising moving that thing all day.
I think I just need to go to yoga and then just crash.
What is it: A class
It's a class. I go to the hot kind, where they heat the room.
Have you heard of that? Sure.
You have? It's great for you.
He was really interested in your work.
Mom, why didn't you tell me?
I told you. I told you in the produce aisle.
remember that.
Maybe you were..
Odessa, what is it you call it when he goes into one of his little places?
Well, take your time. Settle in.
Try to be real still, okay?
There's a snow leopard.
Right in this ridge.
So we have to try to be very, very, very, very still.
They call the snow leopard the "ghost cat."
Beautiful things don't ask for attention.
Sean, there was a negative that got separated from your roll.
I'm taking a lot of heat over it at work.
It never came with the roll that you sent.
The last roll you're talking about?
Why am I sitting on it?
It's in your wallet.
That was the gift.
The photograph.
The wallet was just something I could put it in.
So, I put it in a little slot, the little picture holder in there.
I thought it would be cute.
I told you, "look inside"
Yeah? Well, you got a real nice surprise coming
I don't have it anymore.
What the hell were you thinking?
I mean, I'm sorry, I've admired you for a very long time.
but that is not a good move, at all, with a valuable negative.
Sorry, I Just..
I thought it would be a playful kind of thing.
Playful?
Too playful
But can I ask you, I mean, if you don't mind..
what did you do with the wallet?
Well, that hurts my feelings.
No. Man, I liked it very much.
I appreciated it very much.
So you threw it away?
So, you have no idea what it was?
The photograph?
It's a shame.
It was a beauty.
How did you find me, anyway?
My mom.
Cool lady. Knows how to bake.
How long were you detained for, by the way?
1ilke, 17 hours.
Wow! IHow's that Cinmabon taste?
Really great.
That's frosted heroin. That's what you're eating, my friend.
That's what you're having right there, man.
By the way
In the space of two hours. It was crazy.
I thought I was selling concert tickets.
I never checked
Got it, Mom? Got it
I think this works
Heart of America. Different generations.
This says it all
Wait, I'm sorry, not welcome.
Not an employee.
Sorry.
There's the picture Sean wanted. 25.
You have two days to print for cover.
Uh,Cathy Becker?
Yes, hi.
And you must be Danny.
I'm Dr. Adamson. And you come this way with me?
Okay, sweetie. Come on.
All right.
Uh, we were driving up to Vancouver to visit my husband.
He's up there for work.
And the rain wouldn't let up, so we thought, you know,
Bet you wish you kept driving, huh?
All right, can you lean forward.. yeah.
And take a deep breath.
I'm glad you made it out.
Oh, thank god we were on the first floor.
I was scared.
Case in point.
Douche.
It's the E.R. Mass casualty.
Hey, I need to, um...
Emergency. I'm a surgeon. Hello.
Apparently,
Mom was right. No running on the stairs.
I got it, I got it.
Evan Lang, 16, second- and third-degree burns over 60% of his body.
Hey, Grey. Come on when you're done, 'cause we need hands.
So Robbins was rushing you? you felt rushed?
No. I-I didn't rush. I took my time.
Sorry. I know it hurts.
No. No.
I'm fine. Come here.
I'm just fine.
And then I joined Dr. Sloan and Dr. Robbins.
Okay, this is all set.
Oh! I'm sorry. Sorry.
Hey, are you free? I need a hand.
Uh, yeah, I'll be right there.
It's okay. You're okay.
We're just gonna examine you,
My Dad.
Where is my Dad?
You just give me his name, and we'll find him, okay?
Here. For the smell.
Listen...
Burns like this are really. difficult.
You don't really...
You wanna switch with someone... Karev or somebody?
You think I can't handle this?
No, no, no, I
Because I
So you stayed with the burn patient in the trauma room?
I... yeah, I did. and who was with Mrs. Becker?
Reed Adamson. Okay, this is all set.
No, I was never with Mrs. Becker.
I was with her little boy.
I had just finished with him, actually.
Oh! I'm sorry. Sorry.
Hey, are you free? I need a hand.
You know what? i'll ask again in a sec, okay?
Push another 25 of fentanyl.
Okay, Evan, you're just gonna talk to me, all right?
So you said you're in town looking at a college?
yeah, i got a Scholarship
No! no!
I'm sorry. i'm sorry. i know. you're okay, pal.
Do you want me to do it?
no, i-i can do it. i-i got it.
Three, four, five.
And did she have it?
yeah, i watched.
Stop!
What the hell are you doing?
Okay, let me just say for the record
He was, like, 5 if he was a day.
Yang
why was he there in first place.
I don't know how he got there.
The patient was coding and
Roy,your whole crew's in the waiting room.
They'll see you after, okay? they're saying you're a hero.
Tell him i'm sorry. tell him i'm so sorry.
Who is he talking about?
The kid in trauma 2.
Roy he is fine.
Of course i can, i just... i was having trouble.
Her airway was completely closed off.
I mean, i couldn't tube her either.
What's going on?
There's too much swelling in the airway.
Get me a smaller tube, a 6-0.
6-0. here you go.
Damn it. M
Uh, hit the carotid. Hit the carotid.
And he kept saying something about hitting her carotid.
Did you give blood today, dr. Karev?
What?
You've been described as looking,
I'm asking
Avery gave blood, Yang gave blood, Grey gave blood.
I give blood every two months.
Case in point.
Douche.
Wait, wait.
Don't stick me. i gotta go. sorry.
So what was the problem?
There was a problem.
I came back from seeing the firefighter off to surgery.
Hey. uh, my guys would like to line the hall for Roy
You know, make a show of support.
He's, uh, 35 years on the job,
And there was a problem,
no, i wasn't waving at Reed
Hey, can you give me a hand?
Somebody page Hunt and get me those labs.
I got her labs. I was shocked.
You're A.K., right?
April kepner?
Uh, no, no. this is Alex Karev.
Wait a second. what the hell?
Her carbon monoxide level was 28,
What the hell?
B.p. is 69 over 32. pulse is 158.
We're already filling her with fluids.
They needed more hands.
Keep her on 100% oxygen. no, no, do not.
Not until she is more stable.
Cristina, scrub out, go see if you can help. go.
There was so much swelling, we couldn't find good veins.
We had to start a central line.
We can't use the hyperbaric chamber Until she's stable.
Open up, please.
oh, my god.
Okay. um, you look good.
These burns on your chest are pretty minor.
But the one on your calf might be third-degree.
You never looked.
You didn't look in her throat,
Oh. where's your mommy, pal?
Let's go find mommy, huh?
When we're headed toward an outcome
That's when we go looking for a second opinion.
It's not the doctors, Richard.
They're all good doctors.
I know that.
What do you think this was for?
For Jennings, it was about legal.
But this was for me.
I needed to know who finally was responsible.
At least I was able to do that.
Say it, Derek.
Maybe it's not one doctor.
Maybe it's too many doctors..
Who don't know each other
When I got to that room...
There was chaos.
Because that's the system now..
Chaos.
Obsessed with restoring natural order.
And to fund his operations,
Titan DNA.
What the hell is someone gonna do with a giant worm?
Are you kidding, Martinez?
What can't you do with it?
At 0500, we'll ship out to launch a joint operation...
I wouldn't bother.
Excuse me?
Sounds like a duck hunt to me.
Uh, Mark, why don't we let Colonel Foster finish..
A decoy. A diversion.
Look, they've already got Emma and the ORCA.
Why would they want just this one when they've got the keys
The mass extinction we feared has already begun.
And we are the cause.
We are the infection.
But like all living organisms,
Its original and rightful rulers,
They are part of the earth's natural defense system.
A way to protect the planet, to maintain its balance.
But if governments are allowed to contain them, destroy them,
And within our lifetime, our planet will perish,
Unless we restore balance.
And what's gonna be left, if you do this?
A dead, charred world, overrun by monsters?
No, Doctor Stanton,
I'm guessing you weren't expecting these guys.
Moscow, London, Washington, D.C.
all under attack.
On every continent, the Titans are triggering
Now as before, we have been trying to lure
Their behavior has become random.
Can you track him?
No. Signal's too weak.
But maybe she can.
How many nukes do you have?
Why?
We could help him.
This category six hurricane over D.C.
is where King Ghidorah is nesting.
Working with all four branches of the military,
So this plan is what you would call a "long shot," right?
What do those nerds think they're gonna do
You ain't hear 'em, Griffin?
They wanna bring Godzilla back from the dead.
We'll be out of range while you're down there,
Appreciate it.
The greater Boston area
All citizens to report to the nearest evacuation center
I repeat, all citizens
Massive storms and other disasters
And with D.C. hit hard by a category six hurricane
The grim search continues, as people around the world
And though this sight is heartbreaking,
Cities around the globe have fallen
Why?
That's how she made the signal for the ORCA.
The creatures just think it's another apex predator.
Well, that makes sense.
I mean, we are a bunch of horny murderous carnivores.
Yeah, that's real poetic. Now what?
We track it, we find it, and we get my daughter back.
What about Moe, Larry, and Curly over here?
Godzilla will bring balance.
Oh, boy. Godzilla's radiation levels
We got about 12 minutes before he goes thermonuclear.
What do you mean?
I'm saying in about 12 minutes,
Okay, guys, you need to find the ORCA,
I'm impressed.
It's pretty rare that I don't manage to..
Oh, spoke too soon.
I'm guessing The Breeders aren't singing in praise of the Lord.
Where did you get this?
I'm done here.
Take a look at the contract?
Yeah.
All that's left is your signature, and we're good to go.
I think you're going to do really well here, Cammie.
Perfect. Now you're officially a disciple of God's Promise.
Welcome.
Whoo!
I want you to put on your clothes and leave.
No, you don't.
This movie's weird.
I want you to leave.
You knew that was going to happen.
No, I didn't.
I wouldn't know what to do.
You can start by putting
I really didn't know it was going to happen.
Yes, you did.
No, just..
I didn't have a choice.
Did you?
I will not pray for God to change me
Change will come through God
I must be the change.
I've always known I didn't want to act
Then when I learned that that was a sin, also,
What?
You can't get a pass from God to jerk off.
Who asked you?
Steve, what are you experiencing?
I mean, just imagine you're all sitting at a table together
It's like watching Michael Angelo paint the Sistine Chapel.
What? Why are you laughing? You know I'm right.
That is why I'm laughing.
I mean, the system is working on you.
Fuck you. No, it's not working on me at all.
Oooh
Please... Please don't stop. And so I cry sometimes
A little peculiar
And I wake in the morning
And I say, "Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah"
Jamie, I..
"Dear Cameron, I'm very angry at you
"You already had this thing in you, but I didn't.
When I think of how long it took me
What if she's right..
What the fuck?
You were making a lot of noise.
I'm sorry. I'm fine.
What were you dreaming about?
I don't remember, okay? It was scary.
Let's go! Let's go, baby. Let's o!
Maybe the most amazing part of Adonis Creed's journey, Roy.
Don't drop that guard! Sit.
... ... is that tonight, he fights...
Keep your hands up!
Come on, D!
Three years ago, that's a knockout.
Wheeler's power just isn't the same, and no doubt Creed can sense it.
You got him. Stay on him!
Creed's on a mission, really pressing the issue now.
And a big left hook lands flush!
Creed staying in the pocket, Max. Moving, not running.
Come on, now! Hands up! Hands up!
These two men are really going at it.
Tell him, Donnie!
Another left hook drives Wheeler back.
Come on, baby!
Ain't nothing personal.
Can't say I'm proud of what our sport's become,
Call it whatever you want.
Sounds to me like you just trying to get paid.
The money is a side effect.
"The Rumble in the Jungle" didn't just manifest itself.
Somebody had to make it happen.
Will it into existence.
Oh, yeah, that's supposed to be you, huh?
You see anybody else standing here with a care in their heart?
I want the same thing you want.
Yeah? What's that?
In the history of boxing,
You know that?
But how many do you think they know?
Four?
Five?
The belt ain't enough.
You need a narrative. Something that sticks to the ribs.
Your dad, he knew that.
Creed clearly in pain, as he finds a way to his feet.
Not ready to give up yet.
I don't know. This is getting dangerous, Jim.
Okay! Come to me!
And now, Bayless is gonna let him go again.
Ready?
Box!
Huge right hook!
Drago trying to end it.
And Creed delivers a big right hand at the bell.
Get back! Get back to your corner!
Bayless restraining Drago, seemingly frustrated..
Obey my commands.
You gonna counter with the right
Extend the right, crack him with the left.
He'll never expect it. His old man did the same thing to me.
One early observation, Max.
I think Creed is withstanding Drago's combinations
Box.
And round two begins.
Drago with a huge left hook.
And a big right hand.
Drago on the attack again, now driving Creed back into the ropes.
Okay, can I just point out that "technically" I didn't disobey you?
Ernie.
You said go to the store after school, and I stopped by.
There's proof! I left a note!
Yeah, see? I didn't disobey you. I just took a brief, educational detour!
The way you've been like a mother to Orphan
But you deserve children of your own.
You'll still look after us though, right?
I mean, we don't want those Sarcos sneaking up on us
Shh, come on now, don't worry.
I'm not going anywhere.
All of you are my family.
I'll protect you from the Sarco Brothers.
And then when my babies are big enough, they'll protect you, too.
They are as weird looking as Orphan is.
They are beautiful.
And they'll grow up big and strong, like their mother.
Now, everyone, shoo! My babies need their sleep! Now shoo!
All right, all right.
Now's our chance.
Jules, come on, we'll just stay for a little while.
We can set the time machine
.... and Mom will never know we were gone!
We won't get in any trouble!
This isn't about getting away with something, Ernie!
It's about going back where we belong!
Max, how do you get this to work
A h!
Well, first you run the initialization sequence.
But the initialization sequence won't even run
What if it fell off while we were going back in time?
Let's eat them now
Don't eat me! I'm mostly fat!
If we don't relocate soon, we won't have a choice.
With all the earthquakes and the rising tar,
Soon, nothing in the Lower Valley will survive.
And when we get rid of Tyra, the Upper Valley is ours for the taking
So you better have brought us some good news,
We've got news all right, bosses.
News you can use.
Tyra's had babies! Three of them!
More adoptions?
No, she said they were her own!
And it looks like there's another egg still in her nest!
Another egg, huh?
If it was taken, she'd come look for it.
And then we can take care of her, once and for all.
My babies' first night of life.
I can't wait to teach them everything I know.
Like something's been checking it out.
I can't tell where they go.
Jules, come here!
They're coming from the river!
Come on! Let's follow them.
Hey, Mom! Are you gonna let them leave the nest, huh?
Well, I want to see where these tracks lead to.
And it'll be good practice for them.
Fletcher will never know it was you who spoke up.
Why would you do this to me?
Do you think that I would let him put my son through hell
Don't you know I would never let that happen?
That there is nothing in the world more important to me than you?
Don't you know that?
Andrew
Hi, and... I loaded your pantry with Gushers.
I saw that.
and he's laughed off-stage
He practices.
And he practices and he practices, with one goal in mind
And a year later he goes back to the Reno.
And he steps up on that stage and he plays the
So imagine if Jones just said.
"Well that's ok, Charlie
To bird
But that's just what the world wants now.
Every Starbucks' Jazz album Just proved my point, really.
There are no two words in English language
You know maybe.. you go to far, you discourage next
No. man, no.
Because the next Charlie Parker would never be discouraged.
I never really had a Charlie Parker.
But I tried
And that's more than most people ever do.
and I'll never apologize for how I tried.
Alright, see you later.
Hey, Andrew.
Listen, I have no idea how you gonna take this, but
You understand what I'm saying?
then I'll find you an enemy in a new country.
Done, Sir.
Sir... I often get this feeling that
You're right... for your cooking skills...
and your insanity.
How do you live like this, Tiger?
This decade old furniture,
Your salary has been lying untouched
why?
How can I spend when I'm never here?
I have been traveling all over the world
Wow.. how much have you saved?
About 2.3 million.
But your money will rot in the agency's bank..
No... I think you're old enough to be married now.
No... I'm not married yet.
Why?
I don't get to meet nice girls.
What are you looking for, Mr. Writer?
Nothing much..
Just a sweet simple girl..
Someone who'd make me want to live only for her.
Wow... very romantic..
Okay.
Thank you
Aren't you a little fussy when it comes to food?
Maybe a little.
So you want to spend some time with Professor Kidwai?
Yes.... . so that I get to know him better.
I'll try to speak to him..
come to his house tomorrow morning.
But I can't promise anything.
No problem.
Just the way you like it, Sir.
Thank you.
And here's the cheque.
Whenever you are ready.
I hope you don't mind if I leave you alone with your punctured eggs.
I'm getting late for my play rehearsal. See you later.
You pay the bill.... . why should I?
Yes, of course..
Manish Chandra... . isn't that a boring name?
I wanted a boring name.
should sound like a decent guy... right?
Look at her gorgeous hair...
Okay 'decent guy', listen...
you'll have to get close to the professor now.
I'm thinking.. people here are so honest...
they don't even bolt their doors...
I should barge into the professor's house
Oh, no...
like.. have dinner?
Mr. Writer.... are you asking me out on a date?
Date?
No... I mean..we can have a meal...
I'm going out with my friends tonight.
Join us... I'll let you pay the bill.
Sure.
But I hope you won't turn up like this?
Like what?
Just get a little cooler..
Keep your foot behind that line.
Hey, everybody!!
Guys listen.. this is my friend Manish... he's from India.
Hey Manish, it's your turn..
Have you ever thrown darts?
Hello.
No problem, Sir.
You know what? You don't look like a writer.
For example..
your hands.. they are not like a writer's..
they're cut and bruised like a wrestler's.
Why did you become a writer?
Just followed my heart.
Very few people follow their hearts, you're lucky.
The most important thing for an agent is...
that he should use his head and not his heart.
The day you follow your heart,consider yourself dead.
I admire a man who follows his heart.
Honestly, I want to convey something to your daughter
So, Mr Nazar, what should I do according to your any tips?
Manish
Hey, caveman
I need a drink.
What the hell are you saying?
Can't people like us fall in love?
Of course we can. but not on a mission.
When are we not on a mission?
And do we have a life beyond these missions or not?
Mission!
Is Zoya also?
and now everyone calls me that.
Tiger is a name meant for dogs.
I warned you.. in an attempt to woo her
Say thank you now..
Should I tell you something..
You've chosen a nice girl..
It's five in the morning. get some sleep...
it's her play in the evening.
Sorry...
Excuse me?
In ten minutes you've destroyed half of Dublin...
and that agent got away too... what the hell are you doing, Tiger?
What else could I have done in that situation?
And that guy would have come to know that I'm not a writer.
Not just him... the whole town will know you're not a writer.
Where will the Professor be right now?
Must be watching the play.. what else?
so let's create our own world..
let's run away, Zoya.
You have gone mad... don't talk nonsense.
God alone knows how long our two countries will keep fighting...
we cannot wait for them endlessly.
And it might be a little difficult to run when we're old.
Tiger…
hurry up.... we have to go to the airport!
Hello... Zoya, are you there?
We're getting late for the airport.
Please hurry and come down.
Sir, we can't get through to Tiger's phone. He's out of reach..
Sir... I think he's been kidnapped by the Pakistanis.
Kidnapped! Nonsense!
He's too good for them.
Listen... this news should not get out.
Okay, Sir.
Take the next flight from London and get here.
Which bank has he withdrawn the money from?
How much?
Sir... a total of 47 thousand dollars, Sir...
47 thousand dollars?
Sir... about 2.3 million Rupees.
Should be 2.3 million..
the day I retire.. I'll blow it all up.
Tiger has not been kidnapped!
Do you have any idea...
how much classified information Tiger has about our organisation?
If anyone gets hold of that information..
it will compromise the security of our agents all over the world.
Sir... I don't know exactly where Tiger is or what he's up to...
but he will never give away that kind of information whilst he's alive...
I'm certain about that.
Sir...
we just heard that...
a Pakistani delegate is also missing since this morning.
What?
This is the address of the hotel.
Okay.
This hotel belongs to his friend.
He'll help us book the tickets for tomorrow.
How long will you take?
Might take a long.. maybe all night... you take care.
Sir.... . this is Zoya.
Sir?
There are 201 countries in the world..
and bloody Tiger could find a girl only from Pakistan?
Captain Abrar... why have you called me here?
Meeting like this can derail the whole plan.
Because I'm worried about you...
he is an extremely dangerous agent.
I am fine.. but you will all have to be a little more patient.
It's not that easy to trick him.
What you're saying is right...
but we must know what you are up to and where exactly are you?
He does not suspect me at all..
but to get him to you here is too risky.
I'll get him to you, but not here...
for once I followed my heart.
I just wanted to see where this decision would take me.
I'm amused at the thought of what will happen in Kazakhstan now.
Seen anyone like her?
See there. . in that car.
They look like bloody Indians.
Pakistani goons..
Captain Abrar...
Sir... it's been close to four hours since the Istanbul flight landed..
and no one has shown up.
Alright...
Sir. the information about Kazakhstan was wrong.
No one arrived there today.
There were two other big flights that left Istanbul yesterday.
One to London and the other to Frankfurt.
Then find out from there how many other flights departed..
Sir.... there are 623 flights at London
total number of passengers 825,802...
and those two could be traveling on a passport of any nationality...
I don't care.
keep searching... we have to find them.
Sir... my point is...
if Tiger has decided... then it will be very difficult to find him.
We have created Tiger!
RAW was functioning before him..
and will continue even after him.
Enough!
What is it that they have and we don't?
Five minutes are more than enough..
I don't care... If you have to shoot him... then do it
So, Gopi.... you want me to be shot?
You deserve to be shot.
What have I done?
What have you done?
Tiger, do you know how many countries there are in the world?
201 countries.. there are 201 countries and you..
Really?
Then where is she?
Call her.. let's leave.
For that I'll need you and your boys.
Why? You just told me that she's ready.
Yes but those people who she is with right now
Who are they?
Our friends.
So let me get this straight..
you want us to attack the ISI in Cuba...
why.... to kidnap a girl?
Girl?
The same girl was your sister-in-law in Dublin...
when you found out she was a Pakistani.
you demoted her from sister-in-law to just a girl?
Hey caveman...
whatever needs to be done, should be done now
Tiger... Tiger... Tiger...
What the hell is Tiger doing?
That's the plan... Tokas, you will be here.
Sir... Bablu.... you'll be at this point...
You, caveman.... . you got an entire army just to catch me?
Sir... don't forget we came here to catch that man
One last time.. you'll be here.
Tomorrow morning sharp at eight.
Our flight will take off in two hours...
don't try anything strange at the airport.
You know what? You got three coming in.
Get out the back door now, move.
Anybody in here?
Yeah, we got one coming around the corner now.
Your three guests are coming out of the door behind you right now.
Watch your six.
Oh, Zinger.
Should have brought more bullets.
I thought they were chocolate sprinkles which I would eat normally.
But this tasted like... there's no other way to say it really.
Like a rat sauce.
Hey guys,can you please keep it down?
Look. Unfortunately there's vermin in the ceiling again.
Burger King was booked up.
Sorry. I'm having dinner with Gallagher over here.
Guard your fruit!
You could. You're funny. Your timing is perfect.
Never as funny as you, Super Cooper.
It's not pink eye, ma'am.
It's just.. I'm having a bit of a allergic reaction.
Well, I'm allergic to disgusting childhood illness.
So stay away from me.
Sorry.
Anyway, you are right.
After Boyanov's death,
The chatter picked up later that night.
What do we know about her?
I can pull up her file.
Oh, that's stuck.
So warm in here.
I'll pull up my file.
Jesus, not on my keyboard, with your pink eye infected fingers.
Why don't you just cry directly into my mouth while you're at it.
It really is just a allergic reaction.
It's quite buttery.
Wow. Okay, we could order you your own glass.
That was mine!
My life is a disaster.
No, it's not.
I'm 40, I live by myself.
I've not been in a real relationship since Jerry left me three years ago
I mean, when I gave up teaching to join the CIA.
I thought everything is going to be different.
I thought I was going to be this amazing spy.
Hey, you two cuties sitting here being all cute.
Have an Old Fashioned, please.
His service is really slow.
Super slow.
You're not getting that in the next hour.
Here you go, Miss Walker. Thank you.
Any sign of her in the house?
Heat sensors aren't picking anything up.
There's some kind of interference.
I don't like this, Tine.
I'm up for the challenge.
Let's go in.
Shoot. There is something wrong with your camera.
Can you switch out for a new one?
Too late
Her father would never have let himself this exposed.
Pull back, Fine, this is too easy.
I like things that are easy.
Oh my god, Fine.
I don't know how you do things like that.
Hey. Who's the finest of them all?
I don't know
Drop your weapon.
Fine, what's happening?
Let me guess, whoever is in your ear wants to know what's happening?
Ee's about to die
We need someone to follow De Luca without being detected.
And I would hopefully takes us to Rayna.
But it can't be any of you
I go into the face-off machine.
Get a whole new face.
I turned up. They'll never know it's me.
Do you have quarters? Cause it cost 50 cents.
What, I've got to pay?
No, because it doesn't exist!
Yes, it does!
I'm pretty sure that they're pulling your leg
Seriously. You got to cut that out.
Jesus, look.
one of us has to go in.
Doesn't matter if we've been exposed.
We've all gone deep before, and we always gotten our guy.
Guys. This is more than just a kill mission.
Now we get Rayna, De Luca and some top terrorist leadership
We just need someone who could shadow them without attracting attention.
Ms. Crocker, I would really like to do this.
For Tine
I don't have any cats!
You're not seriously considering this, are you?
Look here, Betty.
Ford, if you call me Betty Crocker,
Not only did I become a citizen and take a vow to protect this country.
I also took a Vow to avenge my fallen comrades. We all fucking did.
Ho, I didn't. Not me.
I'm pretty sure we all took a fucking Vow.
I remember it.
I remember raising my fucking hand and saying some shit.
If you think, I'm going to sit by
You might as well accept my resignation now.
It's amazing. That is really super cool.
This anti-fungi spray can freeze and disable any security system.
Wow. That is quite an image to be carrying all over Europe.
It's also a pepper spray.
Why not, just make it look like pepper spray.
It's a
I wouldn't know. I don't have that problem.
I don't have that problem.
If you ever feel like you've been poisoned.
Chew one of these.
Have I done something to you, to upset you or
Finally.
Every agent gets a night vision scope hidden in their watch.
Okay. I've read about this, I've even looked it
That is Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey.
rom Beaches.
I would imagine a lot if you have the watch.
Hey Pat, I'm flying.
Anthony.
Don't wear out the battery on that.
Am I, Am I getting that?
No. You are not going to get that, alright.
I've already packed your bags.
Hurry up and get dressed.
Carol Jenkins has to get to the airport immediately
This is so exciting.
The Jouvre.
Oh, that's a beautiful hotel. Not that one?
Oh. I hope it's that. Is it that one?
No? Oh, Maybe next time.
Oh, this is. yes it is.
Oh man.
Keep it together, Susan okay?
Nancy? Please tell me you can hear me.
I'm here, I'm here. I got you.
Okay.
You'll be pleased to hear
We have now vermin free
Yes. And don't call me that.
Okay. So my office is in here.
Which means that De Luke's is right across the street at 39.
Oh God. Tell me that's not De Luca's building?
De Luca must have known we were coming
Okay, don't panic. Lemonade out of lemons.
Stay focus. We can do this.
Okay. I got it. I got it
Nothing's coming up.
Idiot doesn't even know he is being followed.
He is meeting with some woman. I don't recognize her.
Zou have any idea who she is?
No, it's hard to make out
Nancy, our guys just switched Rick Ford's backpack.
It's a setup.
Uh...I got to go warn him.
Look out! I got to get through!
I left my baby in the shop!
Get out of the way! Let me through, I'm sick!
Susan, tell them you shat your pants.
That would get me out of your way for sure.
I shat my pants!
Get out of his way!
Move!
Oh, no.
Nancy, I'm in pursuit on one of the terrorists.
He took my picture, he's going to blow my cover.
You're in pursuit?
What will you do if you catch him?
This all seem very Rick Fordy to me,
Oh God. He went into a building.
Okay, girl. Well done, that's it.
Time to call it a day now.
Location is officially noted
What?
I'm doing this for Fine.
He's at the top of the stairs.
Come on, not the hourglass.
Cooper, put down the goddamn camera.
Nancy. Can you pull up Fine's POV cam from Boyanov's office.
And, look on the desk there's some photos there
Renaldo is a Rolls Royce.
Hack into the Rolls tracking system.
That car's a Wraith so is has a Satellite Aided Transmission.
Tap into Boyanov's feed.
His GPS should tell you exactly where De Luca is in Rome right now.
I'm gonna head to the airport.
Forget it Cooper. You're coming back immediately.
Ma'am, I really think I can do this.
And I'm not one to toot my own horn, but
And say that, I just saved a lot of people.
We're so close in getting Rayna and that bomb.
Pull back that rug in the corner.
You'll be given a new identity.
Oh, thank God!
Oh! No!
Your name is Penny Morgan.
Is that even legal?
You know Fine, he's got..
tha 's be a businessman
Well, there's the 10 cats.
Just missing the shirt that says I've never felt the touch of a man.
Oh Cooper, you're right.
You did good work back there.
That would had been a real mess.
Thank you ma'am.
You still went with the cat lady.
It was already in the floor.
Great. Thac's a real confidence builder
He's been at the Majestic hotel,
I like to play the odds.
yeah, good luck.
Here is my phone number
Do you have something for me?
Do I have something for you?
Would you like something from me?
I not that.
What do you want from me?
You're suppose to have an envelope with my gun in it.
I don't have a gun.
I am just arouse from looking you.
It was a joke. There is no gun.
They said you would no longer be needing one.
Good gravy. Was Pepe Le Pew not available?
Oh. Stop complaining, Susan.
You're getting more actions than I had in days.
Months
Do you have an update on De Luca??
Yes, yup. He should be pulling up right about now.
Gh, WOW. He is ho.
Uh, wow. He is hot.
I'm not going to lie to you. I don't think I can be objective anymore.
I'm rooting for that guy. I want him to win.
I'm joking Susan, don't report me.
Let's set up camp in the pastry shop behind you.
According to our data De Luca spends all night at the casino.
I'm going in, Nancy.
Susan, you heard Elaine.
Track and report. No contact.
I'll track De Luca inside, and then I'll report.
And if he initiate contacts with me,
Susan, your cat lady look is not going to fit in, in there.
That's right. Fenny Morgan is gonna burn her cat T-shirt
This is full-blown rogue.
You guys are terrible.
I really hope De Luca is still in there, for your sake.
And they're not going to reimburse you for that.
You should've gone to cheaper stores, Susan.
Okay. I'm going offline, Nancy.
Two, three.
She doesn't seem so bad.
Candy?
Screw you and your candy.
She's terrible.
All right.
Ever notice how my sister's a jerk?
I, um
You know, "Let him be happy"? What about me, you know?
Everybody's making these huge life decisions,
How I'll feel, you know?
I'm supposed to be such a big part of their lives,
You know, starting up new families
But I don't have to teach him what to care.
Do you even have the authority to ban someone from NICU?
I don't know.
Oh, oh, oh
That's okay.
I just came by to tell you that you were wrong.
Those, uh, peanut butter cups got me nowhere.
You're kidding.
Guess you overestimated that Avery sparkle, huh?
I think it's right that you continue her work.
But I really just want to cure her disease.
l want a house
built of old
You could paint it any color
I was staring at Mount Everest, and I was ready to climb.
I'm sorry. I'm not really comfortable talking about this.
So, my legs were on his shoulders.
It was a lovely evening.
And my feet were, like, way up in the air,
And it was worth it.
Oh, my God, it was so worth it, until
Boom!
Then her legs.. snapped.
It was. terrible.
It was terrible!
But this is way worse.
Okay, her pain's still not controlled.
She's maxed out on meds.
We'll have to reduce her under general.
I needed to confirm that she withheld information
that she legally committed fraud, and she did.
And now
Don't stop. Don't hesitate.
You can't be scared of what's next.
Can you just let me in?
Well, all right, but I don't see this as a promising endeavor.
Okay, here's the deal.
We are going to throw leonard a kick-ass
I hardly think so.
Leonard made it very clear he doesn't want a party.
Did someone say... "party"?
He just doesn't know he wants one 'cause he's never had one.
I suppose that's possible, but for the record,
Howard,
Fine. if I do have a threesome, you can't be part of it.
If you make a mark in a mint comic book, it's no longer mint.
Sheldon, do you understand the concept of blackmail?
Well, of course, i.. oh.
Yeah, I have an idea.
Let's throw leonard a kick-ass birthday party.
That's not the secret knock.
This is the secret knock.
what difference does it make?
The whole point of a secret knock is to establish a
Is that rai and howard?
Possibly, but unverified.
Will you just let us in.
So what'd you get the birthday boy?
Well, rai got him an awesome,
And I got him this amazing autographed copy
Nice.
I got him a sweater.
Okay, well, he might like that.
I've seen him get chilly.
Sheldon, I didn't see your present.
That's because I didn't bring one.
Why not? don't ask.
The entire institution of gift-giving makes no sense.
Friends give each other presents.
I accept your premise; I reject your conclusion.
Try telling him it's a non-optional social convention.
What?
Just do it.
Fine. it's out of the washer!
I'll call you when it's in the dryer.
What do you think?
Um, that one.
Because of the two additional ethernet ports?
Sure.He doesn't need them.
He's already got a six-port ethernet switch.
Oh, okay, then this one.
Why? I don't know.
The man on the box looks so happy.
penny, if I'm going to buy leonard a gift,
Water! need water! I'll be right back.
penny, listen, I've got a problem.
Yeah, well, so do i.
Look, you gotta stall leonard a little longer.
I don't think I can.
You have to. we all have to be there at the same time to yell surprise.
Okay, you have to understand something.
We're in a hospital right now.
Why? is leonard okay?
Leonard's fine. I'm fine.
Thanks for asking, by the way.
Okay, I don't need your attitude.
Listen, just hold him there a little longer.
Look, I've done my best,
Ok, , how about this?
You keep him there a little longer, and when you get to the party,
Don't toy with me, woman.
I got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem,
Thy will be done.
Well.
well, maybe there'll be more planes double-checking or ships?
What the hell are they telling you in boot camp?
We are at war, Aldrich.
We're in the vicinity of enemy naval forces.
We get one quick look at best.
Pockets, everything, pile it on the shirt.
Got two magazines.
I got my pocket knife.
Keep that in your pocket. The last thing we need is a hole in this raft.
Pair of pliers, bit of wire,
Here's a whistle.
Aldrich.
take another drift set. That's not how I'm reading those wave tops.
Yes, Chief.
15 degrees. Same read as the outbound, Chief.
If that's correct, then she's east. I had her west.
Aldrich?
No, thanks.
See, that's why you got to do it last
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Be better if we could eat it.
I was doing all right, see. I didn't expect no, "A."
No, it was another one.
I thought I ought to get a "B" or anyways a "C"
marks in school as long I learned the stuff.
And I had this course down good.
I saw that report card, and saw that big shiny "F."
So what'd you do?
I just walked out of school and never went back.
And you had that course down good, you reckon.
You bet I did.
Ain't there a rule?
A guy can have a handful and still be okay?
Sucks the water right out of your brains, they say.
Coming up on 120 hours.
Five days, not a sip.
Aldrich? More like southeast two to three?
Yeah, affirmative.
Okay, then.
Here we are, by dead reckoning.
Then where are we headed?
With luck, right here.
Those islands I told you about, there's a chain of 'em to our southwest.
Closest friendly land in the Pacific.
Now if this favorable wind will just push us there.
What if it just keeps shifting, Chief?
The chart don't take us nowhere.
Unless.
No, you won't, Tony.
You want a damn watch so bad?
Why don't you sit here staring at nothing all day?
I do my share. More.
What's that supposed to mean?
Who do you think is navigating this ship? Are you?
Then where are these islands you told us about?
Kidneys would be easy.
Yeah, one for each man.
I think we need some other kind of talk.
I'm trying. But everything's so far away.
Just remembered something.
My wife..
she had a pretty yellow dress.
She burned a hole in it with her cigarette.
So she sewed a little white dove over the hole.
I can picture the dress and the dove.
But I can't really see her face.
Tony.
I do believe I am in love with your sister.
You'll make a great couple.
I want you boys to know... .
So, take a look at the timeline here on Futurecast...
...clouds are going to start to build,
As we get deeper into the afternoon, though,
2:00 to 4:00 p.m., you can see a few...
I don't know much.
What I do know is this:
A very good woman.
And she was always there for her family.
Do not forget,
All of us.
Death, however,
Therefore, let us all pray for her soul.
Pray that she crosses over to where she needs to go.
And she wants to do a brave, no-makeup role.
Without a co-star.
Jennifer Lawrence wants to play me?
Jigga jigga damn!
So you want to sleep over again tonight?
Think your mom will let you?
Maybe. She let me get a job at five.
And it was a boy and his nana.
I've sat next to people before at dinner.
They kind of make you at the shelter.
Wine that's not from a box?
Anyway, how was "The Price Is Right"?
Did you get to meet the host, I want to say
It's Drew Carey, and he gets housewives wet
Bob! We're over here.
Oh, hey there, hot shot.
Is that my date Bob, or a different Bob?
I need that to be a different Bob.
I think that's the very first Bob.
It was Adam, Eve, and Bob.
Caroline, this is Bob.
Bob, meet Caroline Channing.
Nice to meet you.
Not a lot on top.
I hope he means I'm stupid.
If me and Randy are May-December,
Getting any ideas?
Yeah, that I want to die before 60.
Anybody want to do a little blow?
I'm gonna pass.
We have to be careful, Bob.
Step out of line.
I'm just glad to be out of the house.
Wait here. You're both in the mix.
Practice being excited to meet Drew Carey.
He knows when you're faking it.
My Bob never knows when I'm faking it.
Keep it up. I like your pepper.
Max! I've been looking all over for you.
What are you doing here?
This isn't a scene in the movie.
I know, because I'm in it.
Max, there would be no movie without you.
I would've been here sooner,
He lost $50,000,
But Bob and I talked a lot about friendship on the helicopter.shvsash.com
And you and I are not gonna be
Or Sophie and Gwyneth Paltrow!
I was going to name my first-born "Apple,"
Now I have to settle for "Fritter."
But I'm in the mix.
They actually want me here.
But I want you there.
I'm the stupid you should be with.
All right, screw it.
Sophie, I'm gonna go with her.
Why stop making bad decisions now?
It's 6:00! How long have you been kneeling there?
I don't know,
Bree...
Will you do me the honor..
May I say something first?
After that embarrassing night in the restaurant,
Exactly.
It's just so soon to be talking about marriage.
Maybe I can use this as a tiny napkin ring.
Wait!
So am I making too much out of this?
I mean, it happened 20 years ago,
Yeah, he is, but...
even good guys make mistakes if the circumstances are right.
Interesting point. Wish you hadn't made it
Susan, I am in the middle of nowhere.
The only female I've seen has antlers.
So should I tell Lynette?
Well, not just yet.
Maybe just keep an eye on the situation.
Thanks for the advice.
Just so you know, when you come home,
Her name is Carol.
Oh.. just..
having a sad day.
You've been having a lot of sad days. Is it because Grace left?
Why would you say that?
That was when you started being sad.. the day she went away.
I suggested she leave the lane for a while.
The taxi picked her up this morning.
Oh, my god. So why... why are you telling me this?
Because I have a little proposition for you.
And given how the neighbors feel about you these days,
Someone sold you their house?
Oh, yes.
We shouldn't have sold.
We should have just gone under
Which would have been very noble and very stupid.
Mitzi sold. She's not gonna be around
Didn't have a choice.
What the hell?
Mitzi, what are you doing here?
I live here. Oh, I guess you would have noticed,
But we thought you left.
This guy says he has a job for me in the city.
Puts me up in a nice hotel, and then he never showed.
Huh, and I got stuck with the minibar charges.
So, wait. You didn't sell your house to Paul Young?
What?
Please. I'm not gonna screw over my neighbors.
Lee?
Ok.. okay.
What is happening to this neighborhood?
Some van just pulled up,
That is a school bus, Renee. Those are children.
Well, I don't like the way they're looking at me.
Hey. I didn't ask her to move here.
Well..
maybe it's time you ask her to leave.
So the whole right side of the closet is yours,
Thank you.
No. No, I think us is a mistake.
I wish we had been nicer to Paul.
I wish we had stood by him when he was on trial.
I think about what he must have gone through in prison,
But I won't allow him to destroy this street.
It's not right.
Don't worry.
We will stop this son of a bitch.
That's a promise.
Hey. M.J.'s spending the night at a friend's house,
So, uh, why are you here?
He also mentioned all that work that needs to be done
Uh, wait. Uh, you don't need to do that.
But if you wanna thank me,
Mayor Franklin. What an honor. Paul young.
The media will be arriving shortly,
Uh, with the election just a few days away,
While you're waiting, would you like a tour of the facility?
You're gonna have to leave.
Okay. Maybe I misread some signals.
There have been no signals. I was dating your son.
Okay. If that's the way you feel,
Okay. Yeah, yeah, here we are.
Well, here's trouble.
Bunch of geeks with "vote Franklin" signs just showed up.
Looks like we're outnumbered now.
Who the hell are they?
The cavalry.
Hey, guys. Guys!
I'm not too late, am I?
Nope.
You're just in time.
Oh, yeah.
Okay! Here's the plan.
Once the mayor begins his speech,
That's when we all begin chanting, okay? You got it?
All right! Let's go!
We need to talk now.
Kathleen Kane, 38.
Woman versus shattered baseball bat.
Puncture wounds to the chest
B.P.85 palp, pressure 135.
The batter was jammed with a fastball,
My jersey's really messed up.
Don't worry about that, baby.
Okay, everybody. Ready? On my count.
One, two, three.
I'm here. I'm right here, okay?
Somebody paged me?
We'll put the chest tube in there.
Uh, sorry.
Uh, just confirming I'll see you tonight at 7:00?
Yeah, I don't think that's a good idea.
Callie, we agreed to couples therapy.
Yeah, we agreed to a lot of things. So...
Okay, well, I'll be there.
Murphy, make yourself useful and put a splint on that arm.
We know. That's why this one's on us.
Hey, Cara.
I didn't think I was gonna get to go back to work.
She teaches kindergarten.
Yeah, she's afraid she's gonna scare the kids.
And she can't teach without feeling her best, right?
You guys!
Thank you... so much.
You still want to study?
She has lost a lot of blood, but she's stable for now.
We're gonna take her into surgery and remove the fragments.
Okay. Okay, thanks.
Why can't you tell me right now?
Because I'm busy rescheduling surgeries.
Why?!
Owen?
What's this about a purchasing freeze on the NICU budget?
Good. I have two of you here. At least maybe we could...
Oh. Okay.
We're not buying the babies jewelry.
We're buying them medicine.
Right now, we're low on NICU blankets.
That's baby blankets.
Don't tell me. Tell the board!
Hunt, where did my pro bono go?
Well, I took your advice about transfers...
So I found someone at Seattle Pres who could do it.
That is my patient.
Not anymore. Your patient is, uh..
Do you have any idea how difficult it is
There was no way to do the repair without visibility.
Mm, no, there was no easy way.
And because you're careless and thoughtless,
You think you can just do whatever you feel like in the moment,
She was dying!
No, just go. Let me clean up your mess.
Come on.
And he's intimidating Bailey into not ordering one.
But that's what he needs.
He made me his family, and then I abandoned him.
It's just a mess over there.
Swallow study?
Okay, Ross, I can't read this. Take this.
Ross.
I know.
And I'm not gonna let another one of us die.
You're an intern.
Don't talk to me like I don't know what's happening.
You're pretending like it isn't happening,
Dr. Grey is here.
She came all this way with a baby,
And I think you don't want her to be the one to do that.
I'm offering to take care of this right now.
Just you and me.
Avery. I have one more patient for you.
No, no, no. No more.
And I'm calling Cara McAdams first thing
Avery. Avery, look.
She's all set for you first thing tomorrow.
You said you transferred her.
I lied.
You lied?
Yeah, I
The money has to come from somewhere.
So, yeah, I lied, and now you have the money.
I...
Avery. I needed to make a point with you.
I know we're all doctors, and we're all busy,
So you need to do something now.
You are right.
Yeah. You all need to meet.
I can't force you to
You're our boss, and you can lie.
They've all been short runs
You gotta get over this "Special" thing.
Just throw her over your shoulder,
Every girl's dream.
She's the thing that's special, dumbass.
God, you have the right person right there.
You both want the same thing.
Stop being scared.
This family is not scared. This boy is not scared.
I am not doing this because I want to.
I'm doing this because they asked me to and because I can.
What are you waiting for?
The arrhythmias are coming closer.
If I keep pushing, I'll send him into v-fib.
She told us to tell you that she loves you.
Thank you.
Shepherd?
Oh, have you seen my wife and baby?
Wait. Meredith's here?
Meredith.
Crap. I meant to text you.
I woke up to nothing and nobody.
The woman's wearing mismatched shoes. Cut her some slack.
I have to go check on Richard.
Send me a note next time.
You look like hell.
You know you're in a building full of beds.
I just need to go lie down.
Ross, what did you do?
unless it's hope or a reason to live.
Oh, you make me laugh, sad clown.
Anyhoo,
Leonard will be back in a couple days
As he's been at sea, perhaps something
Okay, well, I don't know how much you want to spend,
Aquaman?
Oh, this isn't a gag gift, Stuart.
Yeah, just as well.
ilt's a pretty rare piece.
I'd rather just sell it to a-real collector.
I'm a real collector.
How rare is it?
Oh, I shouldn't even have mentioned it.
It's probably this stupid diet I'm on.
Why are you on a diet?
I've put on a couple pounds.
Had to buy these pants in the men's section.
Well, we've all seen your mom.
Hi, honey.
I made some brownies. You want one?
You're kidding, right?
I mean, you know
God, I thought we were partners in this marriage.
We are. Stop it.
And for the last time, you're not fat.
Really? Tell that to the bathroom scale.
"cause one of you is lying.
Fine, forget I asked.
How was dinner at your mom's?
Awful.
I had to rub her ointment all over her again.
Why can't she do it?
Hey, you guys are 3-5, right?
Do you know a Corporal Coughlin?
No, ma'am.
Sorry, but I've only been here for a couple months.
Ma'am, if you set one foot in front of the other,
Man, we are definitely losing the war
I swear to God, they blow up another well,
It's like fucking musical chairs.
Hey, do I have to buy a dress for your wedding?
No. Whatever you wear in Kabul is fine.
Yeah?
Yes.
The only thing I ask is that you make sure my friend is there.
Aw, your friend is me.
I get it.
Mount up!
Jesus, Stern!
I'll come with you in the car if there's room.
Oh, great, we're all going to Kandahar!
I can make some calls. We can take my car.
Kim, if we are going to Kandahar,
I can't...
Ah! It's so pretty, I don't even want to vote.
I'm flipping you the bird in here right now.
Is this your car, Fahim?
Yes.
This is a fucking piece of shit.
I think it's very nice.
No one is staring at me. It's weird.
You are in the Blue Pirisoin now.
Let's look now at the 12 first-tier drivers in the current COIN paradigm.
Shit.
Tactical and institutional..
is always in purple,
Kim Baker.
Sir, do you have a minute?
If I'm understanding this briefing,
Okay. Well, I'm covering the girls' school
Yeah, I can give you something.
This war is like fucking a gorilla.
You keep going till the gorilla wants to stop.
You know, Afghanistan produces 90% of the world's narcotic opiates.
So they say.
Mmm.
When I worked in the hospital,
They'd say, "Oh, my son, he broke his arm."
And we would wonder how the arm got broken to begin with.
What are we talking about, Fahim?
Hmm.
The human body produces its own heroin.
In fact, when the fight-or-flight instinct
That is heroin, cocaine and amphetamine, all at once.
Okay, great. Are we having the Afghan version of this conversation,
Really? Thank you. That's..
I owe you one.
Well, how about a half of one?
And then we can make it an even three.
Yeah. Or I could buy you breakfast.
Or a half of one and we can make it an even three.
I think breakfast is of equal monetary value.
My middle name is Eoghan.
Okay, I deserve that.
Goddamn! Once you got no legs,
I mean, there's only so much any of us have any control of,
So, you're not gonna yell at me?
I mean, ma'am...
So, u-um, all set for tonight?
Hey, I'm making blackberry cobbler.
Ooh, my favorite.
Yum!
The real question is, what are your body's secrets?
So, um... see you soon.
Oh, I can't wait. Yeah, yeah.
Alright, see you tonight.
Okay. Okay.
See you tonight.
And are you ready to know?
I can reach for my own water.
The hospital just wants me to rest a few more weeks.
There's nothing wrong with me helping you with that.
Myrna: Is everybody decent?
Except for the ball gag and jock strap, we're good.
Levi. What was that, honey?
What do you need, Mom?
Cousin Shirl just called
Let me go ahead and grab you some wine.
See if Maggie's left us any.
Uncle Saul.
Boy, do you look like a steaming pile of crap, kid.
Same to you, Uncle Saul.
Thought you were his favorite.
Insults is how we show love.
I'm assuming you're Levi, the doctor.
I've heard a lot about you.
How is he?
He's in end-stage heart failure,
Which, I've learned, does not include
I'm afraid not, Saul, no.
I'll come back to check on you later.
Thank you.
I will never take it for granted again.
You know, I don't think it's an accident,
He saw you, who you are, all of you.
I think there's a part of him that wanted you to come here
that you'd have the freedom
How does it feel when it's quiet and cold?
I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
What
He and Maggie are arguing.
They can't stand each other.
They've been trying to be civil for our sake,
But you haven't been around enough to notice, have you?
Well, that would be hard
It's not your fault.
Uh, I don't think any of us should have been here tonight.
Yeah.
Uh, Vic, wait. I, um...
I clearly still have some differences with Jackson,
I-I won't do it again.
You know what, I set you up on a date without telling you,
Deal. Okay.
Alright.
Bye. Bye.
When the body reveals its secrets,
The good news is, when the truth is out..
Levi? When did you get home?
I didn't hear you come in.
He's gone.
Uncle Saul is gone.
And the time has come..
No, but I am Super Gay.
You can't begin to imagine how l feel.
The only person who could is the woman
If signing can spare her this pain..
then I will do it.
I love it!
Okay, I-I don't love it. It's just so...
yellow.
Trust me. This will be great.
Besides, when you're in the room,
Well, you certainly know how to sell yellow.
Excuse me.
I hear you're gettin' divorced.
And good morning to you.
I'm getting divorced, too, so we both need guys.
I'm thinking we should hang.
Uh, I don't know how much Lynette has told you about me,
Look, one woman at a bar is just sad.
But two, and it's girls' night out.
So what do you say?
You up for a little stud hunting?
That's a lovely offer, but I think I'm gonna pass.
Oh, come on.
We gotta get back in the game,
That hair does come down, doesn't it?
Really. Renee, that is just not how I like to meet men.
Inside, over there.
Let the stud hunt begin.
Come on. Come on. We're gonna get started.
You okay?
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah.
When I was 8, daddy left mama,
Most of my friends were either stuffed or plastic.
Of course, there were always mama's boyfriends,
You are loving this.
Tom the college nerd.
Gets to finally smoke pot and be cool.
Hey, I was plenty cool in college.
The only reason I didn't smoke back then
So... what do you say?
Care to join me out back behind the garage
And I am so lucky.
I couldn't feel happier than I do right now.
I mean just so happy it's working.
Yeah.
What do you think? Does this say
No. I think it says "Credit card declined."
Yeah, but things are starting to turn around lately.
I've been selling a lot of my jewelry.
Get out!
Out there and keep selling.
Oh, hello, silk!
Standing there in the mall, it just hit me.
I can't spend the rest of my life
Not knowing where she is,
I have to find her.
Well, there's a private detective I work with.
But Sanchez is a pretty common name.
If's not surprising the hospital couldn't find 'em.
But I know something the hospital doesn't.
When I was in labor,
She lived in El Paso, and she was so excited to have
That's gonna help.
So you think you can find her?
We'll do our best.
Carlos is on board with this, right?
Absolutely.
Hey. I just came by to pick up my envelope for the week.
Okay. Inside.
And don't listen to this conversation.
It's about your Christmas gift.
I'm buying all my girls steaks. You got a preference?
This is a cocktail cardigan.
Look closely. The buttons are shiny.
Where's your closet?
I have never seen so many sweater sets.
Are you sure this is a closet and not a portal to the 1950s?
There is nothing wrong with my clothing.
Oh, I won't need a ride. I'm going home with Keith.
Oh, I don't think so. He just left.
Oh, he's pulling the car around.
Now you think I should play
'cause I'm not.
Okay, before you do anything hasty,
Oh. I'll be careful when I unwrap him.
Renee, wait. Please don't go home with Keith.
Why?
Oh, he's the one you like, isn't he?
You don't want to come off like a slut.
Aw, gee, then chip won't ask me to the prom.
Renee, wait! What about me?
Oh, it's getting late.
Stay in the dim light and don't play hard to get.
Keith, hi. It's Bree.
Do you know why that is?
Nope. Nobody tells me anything.
Mrs. Mmcclusky. I really need to know.
Okay, fine. They think he's a murderer.
But he was exonerated.
Felicia Tillman framed him.
Yeah, for that crime.
What do you mean?
Before Felicia showed up around here.
her sister Martha was murdered. And, all due respect,
Does everybody think that?
Felicia may be a few fingers short of a high five,
Well, that's enough dusting for today, boys.
I guess all that's left is a little vacuuming.
Ooh! Yay! Get the vacuum.
Looking forward to it.
Maxine says I can't go back online
Wow. And I thought your acting was bad on the web site.
Fine. I am sorry, okay?
I shouldn't have stolen your bit.
What was going through your mind?
I freaked out when I didn't get that bonus check.
See, my family's in Virginia,
Yeah, well, I know what that's like.
And even with that extra money.
I always feel like I'm living week to week.
Flat screen TV, closet full of new clothes.
I know. Probably shouldn't have bought all that.
But you know how it is.
Every once in a while, you want a little splurge.
Yeah, I get that.
But... definitely by the end of the year,
Me, too.
How long have you been doing this?
Um.. gosh. I guess I'm going on six years.
Hey, um... would you mind if we just stayed home
Wait. No suit?
No tie?
No pretentious Euro waiter listing specials
Dang it, Susan! Why?
I thought you wanted a little treat.
Oh. I think we should save that money
And we can have a fancy dinner and celebrate
I had a lovely time at the poker game the other day.
Really? What's the neighborhood saying about me?
Well..
For starters,
What's her name? Martha something.
Huber.
I guess Felicia Tillman spread her poison pretty wide.
I guess she did.
I got totally baked off of it this morning.
I did not have you pegged as a stoner.
Dude...
There's a lot that you don't know about me.
Tom?
You're evil. I should have expected it.
Where are you going?
To look at our beautiful daughter.
Then I gotta turn that bong I made back into a lamp.
Anythingi?
We found them.
Oh, my god. What'd they say?
You?
Yeah.
Let me guess... you're going to Tooele.
Yep.
it looks like we're going in the same direction.
Hopefully we're not too late.
Can I hitch a ride?
Hey...
I'll make it worth your while.
Got some good news, sir.
Spotted at a burger joint in cedar grove, Wisconsin.
Just hand it over to local authorities for now.
The only thing we're working today is Utah
Got it.
Lyle.
You did what?!
I hit him with a shovel, man!
I didn't know what else to do!
So l just, I tied him up and in put him in the back room
Here we go.Here we go.
There's no record on file that cooper even had a car.
But charles westmoreland did,
Back then, a chevy that size probably got what,
Now, D.B. Stopped at the station in american fork,
Now, why would a guy headed to Mexico,
The money.
Give me that magic marker.
From American Fork, he couldn't have gone further
I want everything you've got in that perimeter.
Those cons are in one of these towns,
The defective cable runs right beneath your garage.
We're gonna have to dig up the floor to get to it.
Well, who's gonna pay for this
Well, the company will cover all costs.
We'll just dig a small trench,
It'll look as good as new.
How long is it going to take?
One way or another we'll be out of here today.
We really need to get started, ma'am.
We wouldn't
Now that depends on who I'm sitting with.
Touche.
fine, that's okay.
But the two of you being here right
I'm not going nowhere.
I want my share of the money.
Wait a minute.Hold on, man.
Ain't we did this dance before?
You know, I say I want in,
Then I threaten to tell somebody about what's going on here.
Then you decide to play nice
Why don't we just stop wasting time, all right?
Thank you.
Damn, man, you still alive?
And kickin', home boy.
How'd you find us?
Man, if I can do rapid deployment
how are you guys doing?
I don't know what that means.
but I do like the sound of it.
Are you wearing Angel Perfume?
I am.
Oh.En..
Oh... En..
that reminds you of an ex, I take it.
Yeah.
now, was that good memories..
or bad memories?
Both.
Did you talk to Maricruz?
I don't want to talk about it.
I got to get some water or something.
Use the hose on the other side of the house.
Sucre...
down the road, if you're in trouble,
It's what we can all use to communicate.
Post a note on the message board.
What's it called?
you can look for yourself.
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing?!
Mr. Mahone.
They're here.
Those escaped convicts.They're here in town.
Who's there?
It's the police, ma'am.
You okay?
Yes.
Can you tell me what happened?
There was this strange man.
I made him a peanut butter sandwich.
I thought he was Billy.
And once the kids went to sleep,
A long... bath.
And afterwards, I'd just sit there
do her routine, see.
Rub her lotion on, comb her hair.
Thanks. I painted it myself.
This is my partner, Jay Pritchett.
I represent Jetatech. Are you familiar with us?
Not in the least.
Oh, you'll have to forgive Jay.
Anyway, our building is two doors down,
We want this lot,
That's a nice offer, Jare,
It's not about the huge profits.
We're building my son-in-law's dream,
Oh, I know all about dreams.
Someday, I hope to get into encrypted packet switching.
Good luck to you, gentlemen.
Jay, this man's vision just got blurry with tears.
Would you get ahold of yourself.
I just said that crap to drive the price up.
He'll be back.
I don't want him to come back.
Whether you meant it or not, this is my dream.
We're in this to make money.
And we will.
By the power vested in me by the commercial zoning board,
That's a good omen.
I'm gonna pogo it.
Anybody else bring a shovel?
Oh, thank god you're here. It's a nightmare.
The staff is in an uproar about these budget cuts.
Telling them there's no more overtime was bad,
I don't know what else to do.
Sales-wise we didn't exactly have
What do people give each other, anyway?
Shut up! You are not a puzzle solver, you never have been.
You're a drama queen!
Now there is a man in there about to die.
The game is on, solve it!
He is the Napoleon of blackmail.
No chance for you to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.
The alternative, however, would require your approval.
To the very best of times, John.
Did you miss me?
How is this possible?
How is the exile going?
I've only been gone four minutes.
Well, I certainly hope youve learnt your lesson.
Who needs me this time?
Miss me?
Mrs Hudson, there is a woman in my sitting room!
Is it intentional?
She's a client.
Said you were out, insisted on waiting.
Would you, er, care to sit down?
Didn't you ask her what she wanted?
You ask her!
Why didn't you ask her?
For God's sake, give her some lines,
Good afternoon. I am Sherlock Holmes,
You may speak freely in front of him,
Holmes!
However, before you do,
You have recently married a man
You have come to this agency as a last resort,
Good Lord, Holmes!
All of this is, of course, perfectly evident from your perfume.
Her perfume?
Yes, her perfume, which brings insight to me and disaster to you.
How so?
We are ready to begin.
Begin what?
Sometimes to solve a case, one must first solve another.
Oh, you have a case, then, a new one?
An old one, very old.
I shall have to go deep.
Deep? Into what?
Myself.
You, you're dead, you can't be here, you died!
Am I not beautiful, Thomas?
As beautiful as the day you married me?
Who..
What the hell is all this about?!
What does it look like, my handsome friend?
You may leave any time you like.
Dr Hooper, I asked Mr Holmes to come here. Cooperate.
That's an order.
There are two "Features of interest",
I never say that.
You do, actually, quite a lot.
First of all, this is definitely Emelia Ricoletti.
She has been categorically identified.
Beyond a doubt, it is her.
Then who was that in Limehouse last night?
That was also Emelia Ricoletti.
It can't have been. She was dead, she was here.
She was positively identified
He had no reason to lie, could hardly have been mistaken.
Hmm, maybe it was a secret twin.
A what?!
A secret twin.
Hmm? You know?
A twin that nobody knows about.
This whole thing could have been planned.
Since the moment of conception.
How breathtakingly prescient of her.
It is never twins, Watson!
Then what's your theory?
More to the point, what's your problem?
I, I don't understand...
Oh, isn't he observant, now that Daddy's gone
Really?
Yes, really.
Amazinq.... what one has to do to get ahead in a man's world.
What's he saying that for?
Get back to work!
Well, Holmes? Surely you must have some theory?
Not yet.
These are deep waters, Watson, deep waters.
And I shall have to go deeper still.
It was not for several months that we were to pick up
And then under very unexpected circumstances.
Five of them now, all the same, every one of them.
Hush, please, this is a matter of supreme importance.
What is?
How do you know that?
I can tell.
I'm not a kid anymore.
I know when you're hiding stuff.
Well.
You're growing up so fast.
Oh, honey, a part of me still sees you
But every day you're getting stronger and smarter.
I had a pair that matched.
People would always look at us.
Because you were a grown woman in pink striped overalls.
They probably thought we were a christian singing group.
They'd say we looked sweet together.
I wouldn't trade that memory for anything.
I know this is hard.
This is really happening to me.
Love bites, doesn't it?
What did, uh, frank do?
He was really sweet.
Handed me a box of kleenex, said all the right things.
But trust me, i'm never seeing him again.
Well, think of it this way.
It cost you one guy to face the truth.
Your marriage is over.
Now you can move on just like tom.
Yippee for me.
Mm-Hmm.
The only way to live life is wildly.
What?
You took bree out drinking?
Yeah. Why? Is that bad?
How the hell could renee take her out drinking?!
Doesn't she know bree's an alcoholic?
I have known renee a long time,
Well.. at least this helps explain The way bree's been acting lately.
I don't know. There's not enough booze in the world
How could we not know this?
An intervention? You've gotta be kidding me.
We're your friends. We wanna help.
Get out! All of you!
Aof JOU.
Idiot.
Talk to US, sweetie. Why are you behaving like this?
I don't know what you're talking about.
It's not like we can't see what's going on.
And what about all these men? We know about that, too.
Wow, can't hide anything from you girls, huh?
And did you also know i tried to kill myself?
What?
Oh, my god.
How'd that little nugget of information
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
It's not a joke.
I checked into a motel room
With the jocks at Southwest?
Or the "in crowd" at the Virgin Terminal?
You know who's going to be a terminal virgin?
You can make all the death threats you want,
The fact that you two work at the airport.
Hey, everybody!
Here comes the almost bride.
I'm making friends in the TSA.
Judy, big gal, little beard?
Having lunch with her at the Wok N" Roll
It's pretty quiet over there these days.
Opening day, I'm so excited
Seriously. I haven't been this excited
If it isn't, you're not doing it right.
I'm just happy I get to be out front here.
Finally, I won't be stuffed in the back.
I mean unless I run into a Republican senator
Come on, let's open up.
But dat key though?
I love this job.
Wait, should someone make a speech?
They can all suck it.
Yes! Rise, gate, rise!
Ooh, you go, gate.
Yes, I'm drunk with power.
Also, a little drunk.
All right. Here they come.
Yep.
The one day the airport isn't crowded.
Well, I guess I have time to go check my make-up
Han is planning a party.
You will cry there for sure.
That's true. I really can cry anywhere now.
I guess I've got that at least.
I can't believe I work at the airport, Max.
Hey, would you feel better if you held my giant keys?
Hello.
Welcome, you're our first customer.
Do I get a prize?
Is it you?
I'm on board now. I love this job.
Welcome, everyone.
I'm your M.C., Han Lee,
Okay, here we go.
What do a Rubik's Cube and a penis have in common?
The more you play with it, the harder it gets.
A Rubik's Cube was a popular '80s toy.
You suck! Next act.
What do a walrus and a Tupperware have in common?
Hold on a minute.
Something about a seal being tight..
I just got a text from Josh, the pilot.
He says, "What's up, you?"
Cute that he forgot your name?
It's really been a long time for you, hasn't it?
I took off my underwear last week and a coyote howled.
Tough crowd.
I'm talking about you, Max.
Oh come on, Han. Loosen up.
Have a drink.
A compliment and an insult in just one word.
Oh, no.
Oh no, no, no, no, no.
Did I mention "No"?
How can you-say the word "No"
This is a disaster.
And not the kind where I can loot.
I needed those fake papers to renew my fake green card.
Mine expires next month.
Since when do you care about expiration dates?
You cook with eggs so old they fight back.
Sophie will never believe that I'm not marrying her
She has major trust issues
What's there to say about these two kids?
Oleg is a bad cook.
Sophie, Quite loud.
But somehow, when they get together, magic.
You suck, next act!
Says the lady that works at the airport.
And, Oleg, I'm so glad Sophie is marrying you
You suck. Next act?
Yeah, I hear ya girl.
Oh, it hurts. It really hurts.
Okay, wait. Hold on. Stop. Move the wand up.
What?
Okay, baby's brain is hemorrhaging.
She needs a crash "c" while Shepherd handles the bleed.
Get ready to grab a rail and start running.
But when your patient's a child...
Yeah.
Hey, I brought you some coffee.
Oh, you already have one.
Oh, no.
I want your coffee. I need your coffee.
Chief, you need me?
Uh, I wish I didn't have to saddle you with this, Karev, but
As Stevens left no forwarding address,
Unpaid balance? I-I don't get it.
We work here at the hospital.
Yeah, and insurance doesn't take care of everything.
I'm sorry.
But accounting's been pressuring me since the merger,
What's yours in for?
Mm, delivered her yesterday.
Uh, 100 mics of fentanyl, please.
Laura? Laura, can you hear me?
My baby. Where's my baby?
She's struggling, but she's hanging on.
Can I see her?
I'm sorry. no. you're too unstable to move.
So is the baby.
I just want to hold her. Mm-hmm.
Please. I want to hold my baby.
She can't.
She can't go before she's ever even been held.
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
Push 10 of diazepam
Crap. 9-1-1. it's her baby.
Could I help?
Doubt it. at this rate,
She's only 30 weeks. pretty young to survive.
So what, you're just gonna stand there and watch her die?
Mm, pretty much.
That sucks.
It is what it is. it's protocol.
You buy him more time
I'm sorry.
Robbins.
These aren't people who hear the word no.
If they want surgery for their son,
You've been with this boy since day one.
I believe you can do this successfully.
Don't walk away now
The surgery is a bad idea, chief
In your hands... is it impossible?
Okay?
Okay, I'll do it. I'll try.
Oh, you don't even want to know.
I had perfect grades, perfect record,
My parents couldn't do a thing about it.
Want to hear about my childhood?
No? okay.
I'll just, uh, think about it quietly in my own head.
All right, nails in, everything's tight.
Let's take a look.
Fantastic.
End-tidal c-0-2 just dropped from 34 to 22.
Oh, come on. give me a break here, Hillary.
She has a new murmur.
The patient was crashing.
She was not crashing.
It was a procedure I've done before.
I handled it, and she's fine.
Yeah, but what if she wasn't?
No, he's not gonna fire me
Only he was giving me words of encouragement,
For the record, you rock that in there.
Hunt's just jealous he didn't do it himself.
Shut up.
Okay, you won't believe what just happened in the surgery
Tell me I'm great.
What:
You're great.
I mean really tell me,
Clamp.
Damn it. I need more light.
Can somebody get me more light?
Pressure's dropping to 68 over 40. pulse is racing.
Come on, Wallace.
What the hell happened to the Anderson boy?
He's infective shock.
His body was too unstable to handle the surgery,
You know, I can help.
No! no, you can't.
because as long as you're standing
So how about it, Phil?
You gonna stop this train? 'cause these brakes are out.
Oh. And I suggest you lose this number.
Mitchell?!
Yeah, I was pretty ticked off
And then he stopped taking my calls,
"U suck."
Is you didn't believe in me, and you believe in everything!
You know, I knew that sweater wasn't stolen.
And here I pick blue yarn to match your eyes,
Although you look amazing in black. Damn you.
Come on.
"..Leaving 17 dead and thousands without power."
It's bad that the baby listens to such terrible things.
He's heard worse.
Hello you.
Well you can stand then.
I kind of owe you an apology.
For not telling me your name
So is this real?
Yeah, it was used in human sacrifices.
I guess one too many.
Can I buy you a drink?
Yeah sure.
This is where I come all the time.
I like to sit and people watch.
Oh right here.
This is nice.
So what can this piece of ass get you?
Oh shit, you heard that?
Yeah, you. Come on. Get outta here.
Tell your mother I'll call her later.
I don't know. It's been awhile.
Why don't you make a date with Marina?
No? Why no? Look out there, man.
I don't care about that.
You won't help me because you're
I pick up your groceries, I help you with your laundry, your.
I do your hair. I come here every day.
I clean up your shit!
The dogs have got it right.
Nothing you could ve done
The blood supply to her brain was cut off
So even though Dr. Shepherd was able to fix
She's brain dead. I get it.
She's only 16.
That's good news.
She'll be an excellent candidate for organ donation.
Excellent candidate. Excellent organs. Young.
Dude..
You were robbed. You got screwed by politics.
The chief, he needed a scapegoat. It's so unfair.
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.
How should I know? I thought she was here.
She's avoiding me. She won't answer my pages.
So what do you want me to do about it?
Well, you guys are together now, right?
So why don't you talk to her and find out
You're just pissed she's not here
She won't talk to me.
It's just George.
Your friends, though,
Wh-What is that anyway?
It's how we learn, by doing.
And I lost my shot at the solo surgery
Anyway, there'll always be surgeries.
There won't always be fiancee who's come back from their dead
I mean, the only time they ever bother with us
That's not true.
Dr. Sloan took the time to teach me today,
he likes you
Oh, don't tell me you haven't noticed his eyes on your ass.
You are delusional.
Is he cutting into her throat?
Bloody hell.
So I suppose you'll use a strip test
That can damage the endothelium
I can leave.
Dr. Sloan, I w
I was just trying to learn
I mean, these residents are running around
I'm very sorry for your loss but tests confirm
She has no thoughts, no emotions, no senses.
I'm Dr. Dixon.
I will be harvesting your sister's organs
Please, she's our baby. We need more time.
I'm very sorry for your loss,
They could save many lives.
Wake up, holly
I'm very sorry for your loss but your sister can't wake up.
Her basic functions are gone. Her brain is dead.
I knew what I was doing, so if you want to punish someone
You know who your father is
So if I were you,
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.
There are people dying.
Right now, there are people dying.
It's inappropriate.
You made it personal.
None of you said anything.
Those were all our interns.
But I won this.
They picked me.
If I don't deserve this solo surgery.
Then none of us do.
I don't know if I'm more jealous of Alex
I think there's something wrong with her. Mer.
There's something wrong with all of us. George
Not here.
Here
Yeah. I need you to scrub in with me.
I'm freaking out. I'm freaking out
I told her I love her before a solo surgery.
I can't believe that. Who does that?
And now she's not gonna show up and I'm freaking out
If you screw this up and kill this guy
This was my chance to earn it back
But first, a silent prayer for our fallen captain marcus.
Godspeed, old friend.
This is boring. Is he dead?
No, he's not dead. He's just sleeping.
Babies need to sleep a lot
Hey, Mrs. D. Hey, Lucy.
Every time.
Well, that's a nice shirt.
Thanks. I designed it myself.
It's my best seller.
I'm so jealous you know what you want to do with your life.
I wish I was inspired like you.
Or, you know, aim higher.
Open yourself up to some new experiences
Oh, my g
Fine. Just..
slipped on one of your father's stupid golf balls.
Good, you woke him up.
I decided to go gentle with Phil,
And with the new baby,
But come on. He's been alive a month.
How hard is it to support your own head?
What the hell?
Hello, boys.
What a sweet ride, Pepper.
What are you guys doing here?
I've been golfing for a few weeks.
Pepper's been teaching me.
I grew up golfing with my father,
Or as he was known around the clubhouse,
Well, we should play together as a foursome.
Did you see that?!
Yeah, that wasn't half bad.
Hey, listen, I'm sorry I yelled.
No, no, no. That's what I needed.
My old tumbling master in college used to yell at me all the time.
It just made me better.
Really?
Oh, yeah.
He'd say terrible things about my manhood,
So bring it, Jay!
You stink, Phil.
You're the worst thing to happen to golf
Did you hear that?
And he wasn't just talking to Phil.
He was talking to 10-year-old you
Suck it, Nancy!
I was just trying to help.
Just listen with an open mind.
She doesn't believe in psychics.
It's not just psychics.
I'm going to save you some time.
She doesn't have a boyfriend.
Maybe not now, but soon.
You see?
That means
You are going to meet someone special.
I see a handsome man on a horse,
Well, I am going to a renaissance fair this weekend.
Yes, I know.
There's no renaissance fair.
Even if there was, I wouldn't go.
I guess some people just aren't comfortable taking center stage.
Okay. Well, maybe we can pump Marcus
He's too sick.
But don't worry, Cam, you'll think of something.
It's always darkest right before the..
Reuben, could you keep that thing still?!
Okay, well, I guess we only have one option.
Unbearable.
I'll play it on the way back. I have it on my iPod phone.
And the cat's in the cradle
I don't know when,
I never made the time.
Luke!
I need to call my son.
What time is it in Damascus?
Why don't I just draw them a map?
Ready to play, Phil?
I can't, Carl! My boy's sets are in a play!
I get the feeling that something wonderful
Yes, it's Manny.
He got the lead role in the school play.
Yes, that's it.
Okay, I think you might have met her halfway on that one.
Do you feel that?
A presence has just entered the room.
Or the A.C. kicked in.
Gloria, I have to say something.
Come on, mama. Let's get you unpacked.
Oh, yes, let's do, 'cause I brought you a present. let's go. Come on.
it's all recipes.
Not just any recipes.
Some of these have been in my family since before the war of northern aggression.
I mean what I mean.
Um, well...
I guess mike didn't tell you that i'm, uh, really not a cook.
Oh, no, he told me.
That's why I gave you these recipes, and I'm gon' teach you how to make 'em, too.
Isn't that nice, honey?
So should I sneak out the back?
Oh, no. That's my landlady. She's cool.
She knows you're dealing?
Well, she's not that cool.
oh, hey, guys!
I wish I could say the same for your real estate agent.
Well, what do you mean?
What is this?
You left it in the printer.
It's a house listing.
Yeah, for a house in baltimore.
It's all an act, sweetheart. You don't see it now, but you will.
He's only back because he wants something.
I don't know what exactly.
I just know we're not safe here.
Oh, sure. That's it. D has some evil plan.
It couldn't be that he wants to be in my life, that he loves me.
He isn't capable of love, dylan.
I found that out the hard way,
Move if you want.
I'm staying here with my father.
But what happened? Things were going fine.
I was thinking I'd take him for a few hours.
It's not really a good time.
Well, bree, whenever I call, it's not a good time,
Well, that sounds boring. I know.
you give her a dental exam with your tongue?
Bree, you don't understand.
I don't think so.
I'd hate for him to be around en you had another attack of delayed morality,
I am not having this argument.
He is my son, too.
Not exactly.
ellie, your door is locked! Ellie!
oh, shut up already.
Mom, guess what? Dad's coming to my senior recital next week.
I could swing by and pick you up, if you want.
We could make it a real family outing.
Dylan, your father and i need to talk.. in private.
I'm not done saying good-bye.
Yes, you are.
Please get rid of that gum.
Meaning what? You still love me?
I do.
And I know I'm somewhat to blame for what's happened between us.
At's why I've forgiven you for kidnapping our daughter.
The least you can do is meet me halfway.
Wayne
Maybe not, but I'm gonna give it to you anyway 'cause...
I still think we could be happy together.
Could we?
"Selling drugs brings in more money than waiting tables."
Okay, look, maybe I was wrong. Maybe it was flour. Maybe she's a pastry chef.
Yeah! And she came up with that tattoo cover story to hide her illicit baking.
All right, look, I know we have to do something, but this woman's our friend.
Yes, and I'm a convicted felon still on probation.
Are you involved with either one of them?
Um, Doug's gay.
And Malcolm, I did have a thing but it's over.
He got me in with Open Space though,
Yes. I heard.
Oh, thank you, yeah, I'm done.
It would've been awesome if you saw No Exit.
Daddy said you were really good.
I was alright.
It wasn't my best nicht but at least he could get,
Figure out why he's doing,
What do you mean?
Um, it's just really nice of him to help out.
No, I'm fine. Just go get a drink or something, okay?
It's gonna be delicious.
Oh I hope so.
It will be. Can't wait.
Nice to meet you. Hi, how are you?
It's a very big decision, we're excited.
of friends who've been trying for years.
And they just had their first child.
So we'll see.
It's really nice to meet you.
Well, Yeah.
I think I deserve a class of wine after all that, don't you?
Want one?
Yes, thank you. Does everyone have a glass?
Yes we do.
Let's have a toast, to Christmas.
Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Now, I don't see anything abnormal in your MRI,
Thank God.
And your blood work came back completely clear.
But what worries me are the memory tests that I sent you for.
You have sporadic memory impairment,
And there is evidence of decline in your level of mental function.
So I think we should do a PET Scan.
I know what a PET Scan is.
What, in particular, would you be looking for?
I want to see if the results are consistent with Alzheimer's Disease.
It would be rare for someone as young as yourself
Now last time I asked you to bring in a close relative.
I really didn't think that would be necessary.
Okay. But next time, for sure. Okay?
Oh God, back to square one.
Are we both here on the 17th?
I don't remember.
Un-huh, Phil and Diane were saying, they might come to town for the weekend.
How long are you going to, um, keep at that thing?
Till it's clean.
John sweetheart, wake up.
What time is it?
I need to talk to you.
I've um, I've got something wrong with me.
What are you talking about?
I've been seeing a neurologist.
You've been seeing a neurologist, why?
I assume that if I have the gene,
I'm afraid so.
And if they are carriers, what,
I'm afraid is 100 %o.
The kids will all be here for our anniversary.
I don't think we should tell them.
Not until we have the test results.
But we will by then, if I go in next week.
I wanna know as soon as possible.
What the hell is the Goddamn elevator?
I mean here we are in a major hospital, and they only have one elevator running?
John it's okay
We could've taken the stairs by now
Well, um, everybody.
What's going on?
Oh boy.
Are you guys gonna break up or?
No, no, it's nothing like that.
Mom, are you sick?
Tom turned out negative and Lydia didn't want to know
Baby how are you feeling?
I'm okay.
One good thing, at least I found out before the next IUI session
They can be sure the babies will be okay.
Anna where are you? I'm on my way to a lecture
I'll have a regular with blueberries and coconut please.
Alice, where the hell were you?
Um, I went for a run.
You've been gone for two hours, I was worried about you.
Well, then I went to Pinkberry.
Yeah.
Well I hope you enjoyed that
Susan Kirby and her husband.
I'm sorry I forgot. I have Alzheimer's.
I texted you, I emailed you. There are ways to -
I had absolutely no idea where you were,
I told you, I can't when I'm running
Yes!
I hate that this is happening to me.
I hate it too.
I know, I know John.
I am,
I might not be able to remember names or answer simple questions,
I think you're doing great recently.
Relative to what?
I wish I had cancer.
Don't say that.
No, I do. I mean it. I mean,
People have cancer and they wear pink ribbons for you
In 2013, we completed exterior repairs,
Oh that's good.
We also took away a lot of the old security doors.
Residents are issued a bracelet instead which keeps them from using elevators
I don't know if you've experienced this yet with your parents
I see
even distressed by the confusion they experienced from all the stimulation.
So we redefined activities to include
Staff looks for opportunities to many meaningful connections with residents.
Starting with knowing about the person
One woman who had worked as a nurse sat part of most days
That's heartbreaking
We don't have any restrictions on visiting times.
Families and friends are welcome any hour, day or night.
It doesn't look anyone is here today.
Well, Sunday is the day they usually come by.
What's that?
That's a chair alarm,
Is she alright?
It's just a precautionary measure.
It's all women.
We do have mainly female residents here, but there are men.
There is William over there.
They're just not powerful enough to put me to sleep.
Do you want to try Lunesta?
What about Rohypnol?
That's very strong
Hi Alice, I am you and um, I have something very important to say to you.
And don't tell anyone what you're doing
Oh I love it here.
Me too.
Can you believe that that was 30 years?
Don't do that to me. Oh my God.
Oh that was a complicated time, huh?
You were dealing with a lot, what was it? About a year after?
Yeah, something like that.
I know I said this before
Me too. We had a great time though.
Yeah.
Don't you wish we had more of them?
If you mean blow jobs on the beach,
But, yeah, you know, all of it.
Well you were relentless. You wanted everything. And all at once.
So I am, that's how I like it.
Anna's the same way right?
I like you the way you are,
Thank God you do.
This is so great you know,
And we're gonna do what? Drive around the country in an RV?
I don't know. You can spend more time here. Go to Butan.
Well, I think our summer on the island is all the excitement I can handle.
Okay, well you know what?
Hey when are you going to the conference?
Monday.
And when is Uydia coming
Are we going running?
Yes, yes we are. I just have to go pee, I'll be right back
You work all the time.
What I liked about it was how... how big,
Yeah, the scope of it
It's unbelievable to me that you guys had lived through that.
You must've known, you must've known somebody that died from AIDS, right?
Yeah, everybody did.
We lost a lot of people.
But you think,
You did the scenes in your acting class.
Yeah. How did you know that?
I don't know, you must've told me.
We must live, we must live.
There will come a time we all know,
why, for what purpose they are all suffering,
Now we must live,
Tomorrow I will go off on my own, and I will teach,
It's autumn now, soon it will be winter,
Hey, you were amazing.
Yes, so good.
Often they've managed to sustain
Clearly Alice's memory is falling, but she's still incredibly resourceful.
Thank you.
II know you are discouraged.
But sometimes I see patients "Plato" even at this point,
Alice.
Will you be there?
Yes, I'm looking forward to it.
I'm going to be away on business in Minnesota, so I worried.
Are you sure this is a good idea? Considering the state she's in,
I think it would be great for her.
Yeah, and I'm sure it's about it, but.
But what?
Have you thought about making it more personal?
I don't understand what you mean by "personal".
You know, you're not speaking to a room of scientists,
You weren't listening because that's all there. That's in the speech.
Ok, don't ask me then.
Dunno, then I won't ask, then.
Hey, mom, just give it one more shot, ok?
I can't because I have done it already.
I use this yellow... ... yellow thingy to mark it
Got it, totally, just practice more.
Do you know it takes me three days to write this?
You can turn to it one more.
No, it took me three days.
Sorry.
Three days.
I think I'll try to forget that just happened.
All my life, I have accumulated memories,
The night I met my husband,
As you can imagine, or as you know,
Who can take us seriously when we are so far from who we once were?
And like any disease,
I know I'm alive.
I have people I loved dearly,
I rail against myself for not being able to remember things,
And please, do not think I am suffering,
Struggling to be part of things, to stay connected to who I once was.
So living the moment, I tell myself.
It's really all I can do,
and not beat myself up too much for mastering the art of losing
It will go, I know it will. It may be gone by tomorrow,
Thank you for this opportunity,
It's the Mayo Clinic, start up next spring,
So you want us to move to
Everything I know is here,
Are they coming?
It's just a two-hour flight, we'd see them as often as we do now.
I look forward to see you.
Hey mama. It's Anna, mom.
I thought you were my sister.
It's ok
Thank you so much for this.
How are you feeling?
JEow are you feeling?
Giddy Up.
Mr. Student Council President,
One second.
Why would you call me that?
Luke somehow beat me in the election for president,
Not to be hyperbolic, but humans are a decade away
You're trying to tell me
You are dressed like a character
I don't know what you're talking about, okay?
Rainer's taking me to Cabo for the weekend.
So, I had a problem.
I wasn't sure if my hairdryer
Oh, and telling my dad.
I had two problems.
When Manny was 5, he went to a petting zoo
By the time they pulled the pigs off him,
Joe, relax.
Animals don't attack people for no reason.
Let go of me! Oh, let go of me!
Run, Jerry! They do terrible things!
Good news.
The box of hair products we pre-shipped has arrived
I don't care about our hair anymore.
Hey! That's crazy talk.
I still haven't gotten up the guts to tell my parents.
My mom will be cool, but my dad is gonna freak out.
Well, I'll tell him.
Your dad and I are buds.
And I am excellent at delivering bad news with a smile.
And that means the Coast Guard
I'm sure we'll be fine.
Smell those side dishes.
They're gonna be even better tomorrow
You know what's not a picnic?
Putting on your bedroom slipper
Thanks, Dad. I'll take my chances.
I gave Cam's Fizbo costume away.
Oh, my God, he's gonna kill everyone in the house.
The truck was here, and there were so many boxes,
Listen to me.
He's not going to believe that this was an accident.
You can never, ever tell him.
He's gonna know it's missing.
I mean, he pulls it out for everything.
What?
You're cold? I'll go get you a blanket!
Well, if he was going to get the pig a blanket,
Pig in a blanket?
Okay, I teed that one up-for you.
All right, it's time to fry this turkey.
Somebody please lower my splatter goggles, boys?
You heard him.
You do it.
You're not the president of goggle lowering.
I would be if they took a vote.
What could Cam have done?
Maybe he's the one who's having an affair.
I saw a list of clues in a magazine.
Has he joined a gym or bought sexy new underwear recently?
I think it's sweet that you think
All right now, boys,
We probably ought to do something.
Oh, I saw some champagne back there.
It's the guy on the ground!
Oh! Take the defibrillator, I'll call 911.
Guys, help me out. I don't know what I'm doing.
I watch a lot of "Grey's Anatomy,"
No no no, we're not gonna save him!
Jerry, no, Jerry.
Jay. get him off me!
Look at his basket. Wasn't much of a life.
Ah, hell, I'm gonna regret this.
I'm feeling better, Pritchett. I think it was just gas.
Better safe than sorry.
Oh, I deserve some of the blame.
That's class.
The hell happened here?
I think I felt enough for one day.
It's possible I've been electrocuted one too many times.
You know, I learned something today.
I saw a man nearly die right in front of me.
And this is a constant reminder
It's a lot to think about.
So I'm not gonna.
Phil, get me a beer.
Jerry, get me a scotch.
I learned something today. too.
It's a lot right now, Jerry.
What is all this junk?
Fruit Roll-ups, chips, chocolate milk? Ugh.
Th-There's nothing in the fridge.
I'm packing you a lunch.
I've always heard there comes a time in life
I thought it would be when I was in my 40s.
But I'm pretty mature for my age,
What are you even still doing home?
Don't you usually open your magic shop by now?
Yeah. I'm just going in a little late.
Doesn't sound good for business.
And I saw you sneak those carrots out of your lunch.
I'm trying to avoid one of the other shop owners.
Kind of an intimidating character.
It started with a dispute over a parking space
You didn't even have to turn around.
You knew it was me.
Oh, well, Manny's at school,
What are you tearing through?
Nothing. Just, like, a fashion magazine.
In English, your second language.
With all that information in your head,
Hey, I'll bet you can help
I doubt it.
Give me a thrill. Take a whack at it.
What exactly do you want me to do?
I'm sure you can figure out this clue.
Come on, one across. Help me get started.
What the hell?!
I'll clean my room, I promise!
Damn it.
You made it to the Summit of Exmore.
It-exists?
I need to get these forms in by 5:00
Why don't we turn this party into a garden party?
Why is your piano covered with a sheet?
Oh, um, well, because they recommend it.
They say even five minutes of direct sunlight on a new piano
Okay, well, so why doesn't everyone just..
Yeah.
you know that?
But then I see you with this, huh?
Life must be good, eh?
Look, I'm-I'm hungry, okay?
You worry about me being hungry.
Hey, hey, hey,hey, come on.
Come on
Okay, I can see you up there.
If your friend wanted you to know, why didn't he tell you?
Cause 'cause you and I are friends now.
Unless you want to be enemies.
Friends.
Good. Me, too.
Sucre?
Sucre, get me out of here, please.
I'll testify for you,
Wow, look at that halo
It's amazing.
I don't have a choice, Alex What'd you tell me
What did you tell me yesterday? You are on your own
Tt's a cult classic.
Max's mom plays Nancy,
Sorry, Duncan.
Tell your cult, maybe I'll see them next year.
I'll do all your Classics assignments
Papers, your homework, all of it.
Gertie told me that you were failing.
FPlease, Max, what do you say? You wanna graduate, or not?
Max!
What? That's a word, right? Ogle?
He likes you so much, it's so cute.
Gertie. Get real.
He's like a giant, okay? So, imagine us together.
I'd need stilts to kiss him. Hey!
Hey! Hi.
What are you doing here?
I figured you needed some, uh, moral support.
Why, should I go? Because I can if this is weird.
No, don't be crazy, Christopher.
We're so happy you're here.
I'm going to go popcorn up, see you inside.
Wow. Your mom was gorgeous.
I'm sorry. That's a weird thing to say, isn't it?
Terry? Tyson? Tyson.
Oh, yeah, he just got like super-sick super-fast.
Mmm.
Oh, no, not the super-sick super-fast.
Max, are they doing this because it's, you know, the anniversary?
Yeah, I'm here for an appearance.
I didn't think you'd...
Come on, Max. Of course, I would remember.
I have really good memory. It's not just the Adderall.
Hey, do you want anything?
I'm gonna go get a popcorn
That way, every handful is, like, kind of suspenseful?
Sure.
Hey, Chris, I'm just gonna have a Diet Coke
You remember, right?
You know what, I'm just going to come with you.
She is the worst.
She's like a living nightmare.
I can't believe you used to be friends with her.
Look, she's probably gonna pee on him
Okay. So, we're in the movie.
Uh-huh. How do we get outta here? Yeah, I like that question.
That's a really, really good question.
Duncan, can you answer that question, please?
What are you talking about?
Tt's 1960!
Our homes don't exist yet.
They're probably Just landfills waiting to be
We don't exist yet.
I know for a fact my parents haven't met
No, but I'll give you a hand with those melons.
Talking about her boobs! You guys get me, right?
Yeah, we Co, brother.
Listen, we need to borrow your van for a little while.
Is that okay? Yeah?
don't know. What's in it for me?
How about my friends don't kick your ass?
Oh! This guy's your friend?
Yeah, right. You want to go?
No, no. God, no. Bicep, smash.
And that would kill you. That's a karate technique.
No, I don't. I've never actually
Seven times.
Hey, this is so weird. Do me a favor and just zing me. Just get me.
Fine. How about you go suck a turd?
The writing is so bad.
Now, I just think you're weird.
Okay, let's just go get the.
Sorry. Let's go get the keys.
Oh, hey, you wanna give me a hand?
Sure.
All right. Let's rock and roll.
Oh, my God. It really is you.
What? Nothing.
Why do we need a chainsaw for a slumber party?
I know what's going to go down at this camp,
Uh, so, where's that other guy you came with?
Uh..
My brother. Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, he's, uh..
He's napping somewhere.
Okay, let's go. You want to go?
Yeah, let's. You got all the wood you need.
Mom, no!
Get dressed. Now. Oh, my God, Max!
What are you doing here? Get out!
Nancy, if you go through with this,
Kurt said he liked me, okay. He said it.
Yeah, they always say it, they just don't act like it.
I just wanted to feel grown-UD, special.
You are special.
I'm the shy girl with the clipboard and the guitar.
Special to who?
Special to me.
Who are you, Max?
Soak this moment in, babe,
Oh, shit.
Two for the price of one.
You babes just couldn't wait, could you?
We're leaving. Too late.
Genie's already out of the bottle. Make a wish.
TRW. Ew
I don't know. Do you hear that?
What'd I say, huh? Leave her alone!
Lock the windows! Shut the curtains! He can see us!
Max. You have to tell them about Billy
Oh! I love legends.
Loch Ness, Bigfoot, Bon Jovi. All of them.
It all happened so long ago.
Little Billy Murphy went to camp here decades ago.
And he was always picked on for being
I had this dream that when I graduated college,
And we'd have a baby. A girl.
And if she ever needed me, I would do anything for her.
Anything.
I would've made a really great mom.
The best
It's so bogus!
I should have known something was up with this place.
I mean, think about it.
The cash flow, the free meals, the parking-lot receipts.
Just a matter of time before
Just make him an offer for the company.
Tried. Won't sell.
Would his widow sell?
Maybe she could be persuaded.
What is this bullshit?
That's the word on the street.
Looks like a stupid fucking game, you ask me.
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya...
I don't picture Bulger
But then again, he's such a sick little fuck.
The two of them,t
I got to shut this fucking thing down, John.
Now we got people on tape
That is a big fucking problem.
That tape is just gangsters talking shit
Yeah, maybe.
But I got to tell you something. McGuire is gonna start asking questions.
That is why I'm gonna file it very deep.
All right? Problem gone. Gone.
That's against protocol.
Fuck protocol.
Fuck it. It's a little lie,
You know what Jimmy has given us. A gold mine.
I'll handle it. It's on me. I got this.
Authorities in Tulsa, Oklahoma, are still sifting through clues
Today, telex offered a large reward...
Turn it up.
..for information leading to the arrest..
Hey! Turn it the fuck up!
...Wheeler's more controversial business holdings.
Sandy Gilmore has a report.
Roger Wheeler was gunned down
What do you want?
This meeting between Rizzo and Sal Manzinni.
The walk-in in interview 3
Gentlemen, this is Brian Halloran.
You have something you want to tell us?
There's a lot I can tell you. I need guarantees first.
Fuck you. You don't get no guarantees. You talk or you walk.
Okay.
Whitey Bulger planned to murder Roger Wheeler,
It's been on the news and everything.
Tulsa?
So, what does some random Jai alai guy in Tulsa
So..
You two know anything about this?
Go on.
Bulger paid me 20 grand to keep quiet about the hit.
Listen, you got to protect me.
What weapon was used on Wheeler?
How should I know? I didn't do the hit.
Johnny Martorano did.
How do you know it was Martorano?
Look, I make my living on the streets, okay?
All right? I know these things.
Hey, look! Look at me! You got to protect me.
Well, so far, you haven't given us anything to merit protection.
Are you fuckin' deaf? I just gave you two fucking names!
Where was this so-called meeting taking place?
You...
All right, all right.
Okay.
I'm in Miami, I hear Jimmy's in town,
guy, Callahan. And I'm just minding my own fucking business,
And then Jimmy says..
"Do you think his widow would be willing to sell the franchise?"
We all know what that means, right?
You can't do that! No!
You can't tell me they're not connected to this killing!
You cannot fucking tell me that!
It's too important! You can't do it!
Guys, guys!
It's fucking over.
You got to fucking listen to this. It's Angiulo.
I think we finally fucking got him.
Well, Rico does not cover us. Isn't that right?
Mr. Angiulo, we're not infiltrating legitimate businesses.
I wouldn't be in a legitimate business
We're selling marijuana. We're not infiltrating.
We're illegal here, legal there.
Say cheese!
Thanks for all the support.
Jerry, Jerry. Dawg.
Congratulations. And a hell of a career.
Thank you, John. And same for you?
Enough about me. What's next for you, champ?
Tell you the truth, I don't really care.
Enough of this public sector shit.
I'm starting my own defense practice.
Start making real money.
I don't blame you. Best of luck with that.
And you're leaving us in the hands of a new prosecutor.
Yeah.
Who is he?
Fred Wyshak. Fucking bulldog who was kicking ass down in Jersey,
Hey, keep doing what you're doing.
I will.
A lot of people are very sad to see you go.
Thanks for coming, John. Take care.
You too.
This is so fucking sick.
You're sick, Stevie.
What the fuck was in your mind
That's how you want to play this,
You keep your voice down.
Fuck you. Fuck you, keep my voice down.
This is my kitchen.
It's your kitchen.
Don't even fucking start with that, okay?
from his brother Billy's political opponents.
These fucking assholes from Cambridge,
You don't think Billy's protecting his older brother, just maybe?
No! No way.
Really?
MCC Reaper. That's not how it works.
Something's off. I know this guy. This doesn't happen.
MCC Reaper, 6-1 is in the hole. Stand by.
6-1, be advised, your window is closed.
Time on target is no-go.
Reaper, this is real-world, not exercise, do you copy?
No, sir, Moscow police will have shut down the Garden Ring.
Reaper! He's no-go for extraction.
It's too late. Shut it down.
Pull it!
1, mission window is closed. Reaper is out of here
Shit!
Get me Operations.
Reaper!
Get Mike Collins looped in.
Who do you think you're talking to?
The last person I want to see.
Well, maybe you missed the whole part back there
You saved? You saved?
That's right, saved.
Shut up. Shut up.
You're a world class screw-up, you know that, John?
I'm a screw-up? I'm a screw-up?
I'm still your father.
Yeah, nothing I can do about that.
What a joke.
Just shut up. Try not to touch anything, all right?
I'm on vacation.
Your mom will be pleased.
We thought you were doing drugs or something.
Mr. Komarov.
Or selling drugs, but that was me, really.
Do you have the file on Chagarin?
Yes, or no?
What was that, John? Five minutes? Five minutes?
You blew a three-year op in five minutes!
You're welcome! What do you want me to do?
Unbelievable.
I'm so fucking burned.I got no friends in this town anymore.
What are you talking about? We need to keep on moving.
We have to get this guy to a doctor. To medical attention, Jack.
The mission stands.
Your mission is bleeding out over there.
The mission continues. We go to the hotel.
Come on, let's move. Let's move.
This is nuts.
He's got the goods to stop Viktor Chagarin, and we need that to happen.
Well, great, Jack.
Let's drop him off at the Embassy, and we can go home.
Are you kidding me? After what happened at the safe house?
Look, it doesn't work like that, all right?
Yeah, just one.
How come you never called and told me where you were?
Like you'd give a shit.
Shit.
Well, we're not going in the front door.
I need you to hang here a second. Keep an eye on him, John.
Hey, hey
In Russia, we have word for men like him.
Krutoi.'
No. I got a daughter, too.
You?
I have onlv mv Solnvschka.
When she was little. I was working all the time.
I believed work was all that mattered.
I screwed mv kid's life up, too.
You work all the time
Well, he grew a conscience.
Yeah, well, that figures.
Listen, Chagarin is bad news. He's the real deal.
If we see this guy in control, we're gonna see the whole thing fall apart.
I'm talking terrorism,
Someone has to stop him.
Well, that's what we do.
We go out to Chiapep and we do our thing.
Our thing?
Yeah.
That's the one.
It's not the Chernobvl in Switzerland, right?
With all the skiing and the snow and everything?
You mean Grenoble?
No. sorrv, we're not going to Grenoble.
Yeah. like me.
One of these days, I'm gonna have a long talk with you.
Look. Jack.
I'm sorry your partner got killed.
I'm sorry I fucked up your day. That wasn't my plan.
You, too.
I want you to know I got your back.
I got yours, too.
All right. Let's go kill some motherfuckers.
Key.
Okay, what the fuck is this?
I'm losing my patience. The fucking file better be here
You've underestimated us, Daddy dearest.
Bring it in!
All clear. We can ditch the suits.
The hell is that?
One billion euros worth of enriched uranium.
What?
Don't worry, it's stable in this form.
File!
Irina, cut the crap, please.
No one here is speaking about uranium. Where's the file?
No more games, where is the file?
That's no longer your concern.
Sunshine...
...vou did well.
Remember...
you promised to give me mv life back.
You gave it back to me.
I thank you for that.
And now..
..I'm going to take yours.
Static 4, we are ready for take off.
What are you talking about?
That's a tough break for a good athlete.
Jack, you know me.
Yeah, I know you. I know you.
I know him better.
Never was a file, was there, Yuri?
Of course there was no file.
It was simply bait.
What I needed was in this vault.
Chagarin was the only one with enough
I used him.
It's about money.
When's it not about money?
You want to arrest me?
You're out of your jurisdiction, Detective McClane, aren't you?
I wouldn't worry too much about being arrested.
That's a hard no.
Girls, we need to store some stuff in your place.
Oleg and I are baby-proofing our apartment.
My mom baby-proofed our house for me.
She put a club on the steering wheel.
My apartment tried to kill my boyfriend!
He's gonna die!
I'm not gonna die, Max.
Although, this CVS bag you tied around my foot
And the ten-foot receipt's caught in the wound.
My boyfriend needs medical attention.
Oh, I recognize you
I wasn't attracted to you then,
Ha, ha, I remember you too.
The devil wears Target.
We need a good doctor,
Randy, we got to go!
I'll start packing! You saddle up Chestnut.
Yeah, I know the drill: one pair of shoes,
Randy, you better drink up the rest of the that IV fluid,
Max, what in the hell is going on?
Why are you freaking out?
I called the landlord about a nail,
Frank Delaport.
Randy, we're not on the lease to this apartment.
Okay, I'm ready.
I just need ten minutes to saddle up Chestnut.
It'll give me time to practice my accent.
We're totally screwed now.
This is why we should have stayed in the hotel.
What is that supposed to mean?
It's like you don't realize
It's like I'm in a relationship
Again.
You know, your life can be a whole lot better
Why don't you just hammer the nail in?
Because we are used to it.
We just ignore it, like the rain in my bedroom.
Well, Randy's dead.
No matter how many boyfriends I bury,
I can't believe we're getting kicked out like this.
In my fantasy. I bought the building
Took care of the landlord.
You killed him?
I'll call Oleg; we'll get his friend's truck
Okay, first, I believe that you have
But nobody's dead.
I just explained to him the situation,
All right, which one of us has to marry him?
Body Rocket with Papo,
Yo, can you fit these bad boys in your purse?
And, uh, don't forget my new hat.
I'll make room for them next to the hand towels.
Ah, good for you, mami.
So I said to my nanny.
"Just take her to the emergency room.
I cannot miss my workout with Brian
Gave myself a Santa beard.
Hi, I wasn't listening in.... . all this tile.
your voices really carry.
Who's Brian,
Yoga Booty Ballet Boxing and Beyond.
And it's beyond.
What studio is it in? I'll go.
Max?
There's no Max here!
One Ab Blast Immune Boost with banana.
Can a brother get some bee pollen?
Thank you, Brian.
Are you sure you haven't taken
Can I buy you a juice?
And make out with you?
Joke, I'm kinda married.
Yeah.
Caroline, how about I create a juice for you
Has he ever bought us a juice?
No, and we bought him a car.
Schiller, dude, give me a life boost.
Schiller, I'll-have the life boost as well.
Am I saying that right? Schiller.
Will you be in class tomorrow?
I'd love to see your flying lotus.
My lotus only has a one-day pass,
it takes the bus.
I got us jobs at the juice bar.
Earl, this one shower,
You do seem happier, Max.
You're even kinda smiling.
How high are you right now?
No, I am totally clean.
Showered Max is a pleasure to be around.
Also, she's much less itchy.
Hello, I'm a member of Physique Total Body.
Swipe, swipe, swipe.
He's lucky to be alive. Being prepped for surgery.
Anything else?
Agent Rocker, DEA.
The second he wakes up. I need to know.
You got it.
Let's go piece this together -
We estimate that nearly 1,000 pounds of cocaine
We're on the front line.
And on the front line, we can't afford to fuck up.
Breaking up these drug cartels
I'm all ears.
A lot of shooting
I'm still checking the trajectory on that.
I mean, this guy, he probably dropped his piece
And that's. .- Smart.
Yeah. Well, he did take one.
Mike, I'm gonna have to call you back.
I'll get.. I'll get right back to you.
Son of a bitch. Break in my house?
Hi, Sheriff. We need to talk.
Sit down!
Yeah, well, it's been a long day.
You know, I heard about that.
But I got a problem I think you can help me with.
Okay. What's that?
Now, you know me. You know who I am.
Everybody knows who you are.
Someone stole a lot of money from me.
That I can live with.
But where you can help me is to figure out who killed my men.
First of all, I'm gonna tell you..
When we got there, they were already dead
You're alive, aren't you?
Uh-huh. Look, I just don't know.
I just don't know how I can help you, Mateo.
One of them was my son.
He shot Sammy, and... and I tried to help him,
Look, we thought they were dead.
Tell me about him
And then he shot me
I swear to God. I have no idea who these people are
Unless you were planning on going somewhere.
The DEA has taken over
Work with them.
I'll really make it worth your while.
Well, uh..
that sounds just fine, Mr. Perez.
This guy stole $3 million from me.
and I'll give you a hefty finder's fee.
And then you can just go on your merry way.
Now that sounds like a good deal.
You gonna keep pointing that gun at me, partner?
Okay.
Keep somebody on him.
Jet's find out where it takes US
That's loco! Hell, no. Come on.
Cole
Can you run a history?
Sure. What are the numbers?
Foxtrot, Golf, Seven, Nine, Six, One, Hotel
People
Mateo Daniel Perez was spotted
Now, what's a drug lord like Mateo
And to top it all off
Now, people..
we've had a guy on the inside of Perez's gang
I don't remember a goddamn thing
I'm sure it's just temporary.
No! It's not temporary.
I'm in trouble here.
Anything can get fixed.
You'll be fine. Everything will be fine.
I shot a cop. I killed him.
I know I shot other people, too. I just .. I just can't remember!
I can't remember a fucking thing!
I am gonna take care of you.
Shit.
So, the mess was man-made.
What did you do with it?
What do you mean, what'd I do with it?
threw it in the trash
I get the picture.
You got cameras in the bathrooms?
Now, sir..
you know that is so illegal.
Show me where you threw the trash.
I'm gonna need to see footage from that camera.
I don't think the DEA's gonna go that far.
You know who Sam's old man is?
Mateo Perez
JesUs. What'd you get yourself into?
Now, he paid me a private visit.
He wants me to find the guy and hand him over.
Well, what are you gonna do?
I'm gonna find this son of a bitch and hand him over.
Well, what if you don't?
You and I have seen enough dead bodies of people
Now, you know goddamn well I didn't kill Sam.
I just need a little time to get out from underneath this.
All right.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna forget the DEA.
I will shoot you.
It was all about the money, huh, Chris?
It's always about the money, honey.
Now get me the fucking money!
Oh, baby.
You know, maybe we should just get married.
That way I can get you your green card.
Things work out, maybe I'll even get you a boob job.
Aw, shit.
Yeah, Mike?
Now, you didn't get this from me.
You don't know him like I do.
Ie's a monster.
Fuckin' damned rapist.
He raped me.. again and again.
Do you know how that feels?!
You promised to help me get out of here.
You give me that money right now!
Drop your fuckin' guns.
Drop the fuckin' gun!
Put it down, motherfucker!
Shit.
Did you miss me?
I'm sure glad to see you.
You seriously fucked up my day, son.
You took my money, and you left me with Mateo Perez.
You dumb shit. We could have been partners on this.
Goddamn! I didn't think I'd see you again.
Well, next time you better kill me all the way.
Well, next time, I'll remember that.
Don't strain yourself.
I could give two shits about the trouble you got yourself into.
Or why you killed the kid!
Kid?
All I care about is the goddamn money!
Now where the fuck is it?!
That don't look like $3 million, asshole!
Now where's the rest?!
I might have put that money somewhere safe.
Now, where exactly did you put it?!
Well, see, that's the problem.
With all this head-trauma shit, I can't remember.
I'm not gonna ask you again.
Yes, ma'am.
I think we found our guy.
Several traffic cams show a van blowing through red lights.
It's now in the parking garage at The Streamline Bus Station.
I ran the plates, and the van belongs to Ferez.
Why? You now have the offer of command in writing.
Yes, well, a liar's word is worthless, even ON paper.
You know I'd love you just as much if you were a merchant captain?
And you wouldn't be gone for two years.
I won't be gone two years.
She lost two men and still with her hull half empty.
Well, they were from Bedford and they didn't have me aboard.
Son of a bitch!
I will captain my own ship..
a whaling ship.
Up to them all we'd ever have is a patch of dirt
What's wrong with his words?
He wanted things for his family, for himself.
Ile was a dreamer, Owen
Dreamed of the sea and never got to sea with men like them.
At least he got to see his children born.
It's all I know.
I'll come back as quick as the sun is night, I swear.
Please come back... . promise me.
I already swore to you, now you want me to promise, too.
I promise.
Son, a word with you.
To be a captain, you cannot be a friend, you are their superior.
Never forget that, never let THEM forget that.
Thank you, son.
Your great-grandfather and a few others created this industry.
Without us, without you, the world plunges into darkness.
I hope to bring honor to the Pollard family name, Sir.
That wondrous monster of a mighty length;
But, everlasting God, thou dost ordain that we, poor feeble mortals
O Father, grant that your glorious light shine on these men,
So that the white whales of Nantucket whale oil
So, what month is this?
Oh, late in the year, we were one of the last ships to go out.
Which is why my friend Barzillai and I got a berth.
Look, I was fourteen... fourteen.
Stand clear!
Nice piece of work, Mr. Chase!
If we make Cape Verdes in the next 2 weeks we'll
Corn, Mr. Chase?
No, thank you, Sir, never did have much of a taste for it.
That's odd.
So, your father grew corn on Cape Cod.
That's right, he did.
As you can imagine, I suddenly grew tired of eating it every day.
Corn, okra, beans, I believe? Before he went to jail.
Are you familiar with this story, Mr. Joy?
orphaned due to his father's incarceration?
Well, we all have our paths to sea.
That's a motive to not ask too many questions.
Can't have been easy though, yet..
You had Nantucket's great seafaring family to adopt you.
Now, if the captain will excuse me, there are whale boats and watches to assign.
No, Sir, not for me.
Not a drop?
No, Sir, like I said, sometimes the fewer questions one asks, the better.
That's a gorgeous girl, Mr. Joy.
No touching!
I always thought you were married anyway.
I am, and there she is.
Well, that's her nose anyway.
Congratulations, ladies.
Aye, Sir.
There'll be six men to a boat, first rules in the row, six bells sharp.
We're not even east of Halifax, Sir.
What's your name?
Coffin, Henry Coffin.
He's the Captain's cousin, Sir.
Well, well, Mr. Coffin, do you think a whale knows it's east of Halifax?
I don't know who all of you are, or how you got here,
That's fine, I don't give a damn, but we interred you for just one thing...
and one thing only, and that is whale oil.
I intend to fill our 2000 barrels and be home as quickly as possible.
And even when the weather is fine and there ARE no whales, Mr. Coffin,
We are two days behind.
You need to make up the time before we catch the east wind.
Set stuns's.
Belay that, set stuns's.
Get her off, Mr. Coffin, the Captain wants speed!
Aye, Sir.
She might be old but she can still blow, boys!
Sir, a squall on the starboard route, we need to shorten the sail immediately.
Sir, we are headed into a storm of more than 8 knots
Let it come, the men are soft from months on land, they
If we don't shorten sail and bear off it'll catch us on the beam.
Chase, we will stand on.
Mr. Lawrence, hold our course.
Holding course, Sir.
We'll lose half a day running like that.
Best secure for heavy weather.
Best prepare for weather, Mr. Bond, we're headed into a squall.
We must fall off and run with it.
Stand down, Mr. Chase.
Mr. Lawrence, hold your course.
Holding course, Sir.
Shorten the sails Mr. Chase.
We need to cut those sails down!
Turn the ship, head for land!
No, the damage is done!
It's too late, it's too god damned late!
Captain George Pollard, the Essex.
Capitian Clemente Pelaez, the Santa Maria.
Would you buy a colleague a drink?
Same as always, George.
Yes, Captain
How far out?
Far enough for only a fool to go.
How far would that be?
A thousand leagues along the Equator...
in offshore grounds.
Were there whales there?
More than you've ever dreamt.
Sir, what are you doing?
Where is he?
It could be Ducie Island.
Without a map, compass or quadrant there's no way to be certain.
We will keep fires going night and day,
This is what I wanted you to see.
They've been here a long time, for no doubt..
waiting for a ship.
But no ship came.
No ship is going to come.
If we stay, we die.
How long do you think it would take to trust the birds
It's a privilege to know the moment of one's death in advance.
And to be able to prepare for it..
a curse to be so far from home...
or a chance to say goodbyes, without a chance to make peace...
or a chance to settle scores.
But alas, at least those are settled between us
Captain of what?
It was as if Owen Chase himself had spoken.
He told them the truth.
Cap'n Pollard's conscience was clear..
but the inquiry was a sham.
over the white whale.. they never found it.
He ran a second ship around off of Hawaii..
twice cursed.
then take over our planets.
Horrors that you remember
It's all blank. My life.
You're supposed to take the form
Perhaps this is a mercy
Freeing you to do what all Kree must.
Put your people's needs before your own.
We've given you a great gift.
The chance to fight for the good of all Kree.
I want to serve.
Then master yourself.
What was given can be taken away.
I won't let you down.
We'll know soon enough.
You have a mission.
Serve well, and with honor.
This can't be good.
We slip in, we locate Soh-Larr..
and we get out, leaving them none the wiser.
The Torfan populace.
We are not to interfere with them,
Nothing compromises the security of our mission.
Proceed with caution.
Follow protocol before extracting him.
This is a dangerous mission.
We must all be ready to join the Collective
For the good of all Kree!
Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon.
Do you read me? Does anybody copy?
Repeat.
His beacon's coming from that temple. Let's move.
No. This is a perfect spot for an ambush.
Only one way in, only one way out.
We can get past the locals.
We don't know if they are locals.
Too risky.
You don't have to go with me. I'll go alone.
No, you won't.
Right. We keep a close radius.
"Pegasus. Dr. Wendy Lawson." That's her.
Do you hear that, too?
Do we have her location?
Got it.
Now track Lawson until we find the energy signature.
Interesting.
Hold on.
Go back right before this. Go back.
That's no MiC, Lawson.
This is it. Now let me see where you're headed.
That's right. Look at the coordinates.
Rookie! Go talk to the rent-a-cop.
Did you call this in?
Beacon activated.
Excuse me, miss.
You know anything about a lady blowing a hole
Witness says she was dressed for laser tag.
Yeah, I think she went that way.
I'd like to ask you some questions.
Maybe give you the 411 on the late-night drop box.
Could I see some identification, please?
Vers. Kree Starforce.
We don't carry our identification on little cards.
Vers?
This is gonna get a little awkward, but I gotta ask.
You think I'm one of those green things.
Can't be too careful.
You are looking at 100% red-blooded Earth man.
I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.
We talking cheek swab or urine sample?
No. The DNA would match.
Want my AOL password?
They believe that she developed
Light-speed engine?
Gotta admit, that's not the craziest thing I've heard today.
Well, it's still early.
And you, what do you want?
I'm guessing that's not standard Kree operating procedure.
Well, I won't tell your boss if you don't tell mine.
Ronan.
The Accusers completed their operation...
It was a trap
Give us their location.
We'll take care of the terrorist threat.
By bombing them out of the galaxy?
No, we'll handle this.
Excuse me, I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.
Auntie Carol?
Mom, it's Auntie Carol!
I knew it! Everyone said you were dead!
But we knew they were lying.
I'm not really who you think I am.
That is the craziest shit I ever heard.
Green transforming aliens? There's no such thing.
You are absolutely right, young lady.
There is no such thing.
That system is fallible, as we've learned.
Okay, then let's do this.
Who do I see when I commune with the Supreme Intelligence?
The person you most admire and respect, I'd guess.
But you would never tell me who.
And what is your earliest memory of Hala?
The transfusion.
Blue blood running through my veins.
Whose blood?
That's my blood that's coursing through her veins.
What have you done with her?
You're too late.
She knows?
Come at once.
For the good of all Kree, Commander,
Passing 500 and climbing.
You know, you really shouldn't have that thing on your lap.
Our little alliance with you is tenuous at best.
And as long as he continues to freak you out
yeah, I'm gonna keep giving him
Can I ask you something?
Do you just turn into anything you want?
Well, I have to see it first.
Can you all do it?
Buckle up, folks.
Is this normal, like, space turbulence?
Pretty much.
Locking in on coordinate grid.
Where is it?
It's here. It's gotta be here.
Well, is it in front of all that nothing, or behind it?
What did you do to your uniform?
They got in her head. Just like we thought.
The Supreme Intelligence will set her straight.
You can see they're not soldiers.
Let 'em go. You can have me.
And the core?
You lied to me.
I made you the best version of yourself.
What's given can be taken away.
Back here! Move, move!
Get over here. Get down!
Let's go! Go, move!
There she is.
Which you will not be celebrating
Sheldon, we've been through this.
I'm taking Penny.
Afraid not. Do you recognize this?
Not the roommate agreement.
Indeed, the roommate agreement.
I call your attention to the Friendship Rider
"Number 37: in the event one friend is ever invited
You actually put that in an agreement?
Yeah. We also put in what happens
He can't kill me, even if I turn.
Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend?
Yeah. He thinks I betrayed him.
I mean, come on. What would you guys do if you were me?
I'd take Sheldon to Switzerland.
Seriously?
Absolutely.
And I'd leave him there.
What the hell is that?
Uh, let's see.
30 pieces of silverware.
So just, like, keep that in mind when you're in there.
Yeah, just think, "little boys, little boys."
Hello.
Oh, hey. Sheldon. We're kind of in the middle of something.
Oh, I won't be a moment. I just need to grab a book
Sheldon, come home!
They don't want to have your baby!
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh-oh, dear, I think I got something in my eye.
My piercing, blue eye.
Sheldon!
Fine.
I've also never had a cavity and I don't have asthma..
Now, remember, do not bring up any baby stuff, all right?
Not me not wanting one, not you having one with Zack.
Got it.
And if he brings it up, change the subject
I got it.
But not the Cornhuskers. Do not discuss the Cornhuskers.
Is that a sports team?
Never mind, you're good.
Daddy!
Hi. Hey. Slugger.
Hey. Wyatt.
Leonard.
Hey, that's a hell of a handshake.
Ah, well, you know, I've been taking vitamins.
Dad, uh, come on in, sit down.
Can I get you something to drink? Maybe a beer?
Sure, if you're having one.
Okay.
And why wouldn't you, since you're not pregnant?
Leonard wants to have a baby with my ex-boyfriend Zack.
How would you say it?
Uh, same words, just less angry.
Well, I don't know about Los Angeles,
It's strange here, too, and we have a bakery for dogs.
And you're okay with this?
I support my husband.
Thank you.
But, you know, if you think differently,
Are you guys ready for the most intense experience of your life?
Yes.
Definitely.
Not to brag, but I'm an astronaut,
Can be pretty scary.
Please, I'm, like, 90 pounds.
I'm weightless every time I hold more than three balloons.
Okay, I just need you guys to sign these waivers,
There are a lot of pages here.
Is this a waiver or a screenplay you've been working on?
I'm sure it's just boilerplate.
Absolutely. It's to protect us in case of injury.
It says, "or death."
Done.
Where are the changing rooms?
Dressing rooms are in the back.
No peeking.
Here you go.
Okay. Should we go get changed?
What am I doing?
If you don't want to do this,
To prove to Howard that he doesn't know me as well
Looks like he does.
Unless I do it and then he doesn't.
Why not just be honest?
You're right.
I should be honest.
You owe me $3,000 for those plane tickets to lndia!
That was a long run.
Yeah. Well, I was in the zone.
You know, and then in a diner
Are you avoiding me?
Well, I took a nap next to Hot Dog on a Stick.
What do you think?
I think you're mad at me and Leonard,
Why would I be mad at myself?
A couple of questions
Have you seen any of these men?
Sorry.I don't recognize any of them
Pull over up there.
We're going to have to inspect your car.
But I thought you said
Now pull over.
Do you want some water?
Or do you want to tell me where Michael Scofield is?
I don't know where he is.
You know, from the first day you started here.
I guess I just know a con when I see one, huh?
Maybe you'll get to be employee of the month.
I'm waiting.
There's been a change in venue.
Oh, well, well, well.
I finally get to talk to the brains of the outfit.
We're at the Plaza De Francia.
So you're thinking public place, safety in numbers,
I'm thinking public place, wanted men, police,
You don't want to help, then don't.
Get outta here shoo fly
Then it's home, sweet home.
This is my house
Get out
He's gonna get us out of here.
In between jobs.
Oh. sorry to hear that.
Yeah, we've all been there.
I'm sure something will come up before long.
I'm hoping it's right around the corner.
Here.
You won't be needing this anymore.
What's this for?
You're gonna give me some real information on Michael Scofield.
Or it's gonna be your funeral.
I don't know where he is.
I don't know how to reach him, I swear.
I take offense, patron.
I've had many foot-washers.
Many men have come in with sheep's clothing,
I am not trying to hurt you. I am trying to save you.
Save me?
I'm gonna die here.
Your life is in jeopardy just being with me.
Not necessarily.
As I was being escorted back inside today, one of the guards
If a guard spoke to you, he was lying.
It's impossible to get out.
Maybe you've been too busy dying to notice,
I found this in his pocket.
Would you care
I've got no idea what it is.
It's from the gift ship.
It's plastic.
Now, if you'll excuse us.
What?
Stay where you are.
Why? where is your identification?
Hey, come on, guys, focus.
Oh, mighty Nicolas Cage tree,
Oh, Lucy's free after all.
See ya.
Hey, hey, hey, you can't leave.
We just started.
You're right, I should finish the game.
I take my plus-one long sword,
I'm dead, I've got a date with a girl.
Bye.
We'll be fine, watch.
Suddenly, a spectral shape
I'm very happy you were able to hang out tonight.
Me, too.
Not that it's up to you to make me happy.
Sorry. I-I'm just saying, if you ever wanted
Sweet again, but I think that might be a little weird
Yeah, I get that.
I just wouldn't forgive myself if I didn't ask.
But never worry if you're gonna be okay, Lynette.
You will. You are the exact kind of woman
You're welcome.
Oh, hey, I'm off on Friday,
Uh, bad news. Uh, I checked the weather up there.
It looks like rain for this weekend.
So? I wasn't seeing us spending a lot of time outdoors.
I think we have a little...
"Horizontal" to catch up on.
It's kind of been a while, hasn't it?
Well, I guess, with, uh, work and everything.
A cabin, the rain..
A bed.
It's gonna be a good weekend.
Yes, Lynette had tried hard
Hey, Gregg.
But sometimes, the low road was easier to find.
Carlos Solis was used to sitting in a position of power,
at the head of a power lunch...
or at the helm of a powerful company.
But now that Carlos Solis had started a new career,
So.. what do you think of my new office?
Aw, that's so sweet.
You're lying to spare your daddy's feelings.
Seriously,. honey, there's a guy down at the department store
"Spruce it Up"?
Gaby, we can barely keep the lights on here.
Our budget is tiny, and every cent goes towards
Okay, okay. Save it for the pamphlet.
All I'm saying is, if I was an addict,
Okay, behave. Listen to your daddy.
I'll see you tonight.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I can't take the girls to school.
You always take them.
'cause you can't even make a turkey sandwich.
Well, thank goodness I have the most talented partner.
Now come on. We're wasting time.
Let's get hammering.
Seriously? You're telling me
I've just seen too many cases
Not my clients, of course.
Well, I just think our society's gotten too soft.
We need a powerful deterrent to stop these killers.
You do realize you're not on trial
But not about a murder.
Tell me what's going on, or I'm walking out of this house.
You're gonna need to let me think about it.
I don't believe this.
My, uh, my first husband kept secrets from me,
I'm not going down this road again.
Gaby, why is there an old lady
Do you have any idea who that is?
I think my generic reference to her as "Old lady"
She's Doris Hammond,
Ring any bells?
Bill Hammond's widow?
Guy made a killing in private equity.
Why is she here?
Isn't it lovely. Carlos?
Yeah, it's great.
Oh, I almost had a heart attack when I saw the price.
I guess I just have to get comfortable
That's right, and tomorrow when the new fall line comes in,
So, Carlos..
What is it you do?
I... work for a nonprofit that helps recovering addicts.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Was Carlos talking about his charity?
Good thing we weren't operating heavy machinery,
You'll have to excuse my wife.
Not the biggest fan of what I do.
Oh, that's silly.
Philanthropy is very important.
My Bill gave generously to many worthy causes.
Okay, if we're gonna keep talking about charity,
Boy, Bill left quite a legacy.
All right. You know what? Will you just sit down and be quiet?
Did you check your blood sugar?
Uh, 56, but I don't have, uh, any juice.
I just have, uh, half a can of diet soda, so
Oh, damn it. Look at you.
What?
You look amazing.
You were on a date, weren't you?
I made you come here in the middle of a date.
No, no, no, you know what? Actually,
All your colleagues are showing some kind of leadership potential.
Grey and Avery, they're on clinical trials,
They have a plan.
I was just wondering if you had a
Sorry?
Yeah, I'm gonna bring over about a dozen kids from Africa
Huh. Sounds pretty ambitious.
Well, I'm am ambitious guy.
Also sounds like you just pulled that outta your butt.
I mean, they're incredible surgeries... on kids.
Oh, okay. So it's coming out of my budget?
Well, I'm saying, if I do all the logistical crap,
I mean, it's worth...
Nothing.
That's what it's worth. No, no.
I'm sorry.
Right. I should've known what you'd say.
No, no, no. You don't get to do that.
You don't get to ask me to fund a plan this half-assed
Come on.
I mean, yeah, there are people that can do this sort of thing,
Mrs. Pulcher.
Is it two hours already?
It seems like I saw your slack jaw a minute ago.
Or you could do something good with the money.
Donate it to a good cause, help someone out.
Or put it to getting you a medical degree.
Mrs. Pulcher,
You askin' me for money?
I need at least 100 grand to get things started.
Oh, my God.
Take it somewhere else, Sally Struthers,
Overall, Adele scored a 23, which is a marked decline
So she's definitely a lot worse than we thought.
Well, the upside is, she gets in the trial.
But she's declining so fast.
I know.
Why can't we just give her the medicine on the side
No. The F.D.A. is gonna be on us harder than ever.
Don't think I haven't thought about it.
She's in heart failure.
She's gotta go back on the vent.
She needs surgery now?
Well, as soon as possible.
So should I get her prepped?
Yeah, looks like I'm stuck with you, too, huh?
Are you ready to go back?
One more lap.
What, did you lose a bet?
She's my new physical therapist
Whose charts are those?
Altman's. She's being ridiculous.
I haven't seen a cardio surgery in a month.
So you stole her charts?
Yes, I stole her charts,
Grey, sit. I need the resistance.
She's worse than we thought.
But at least she's gonna get in the trial.
Okay, see?! See?! I should be on this.
How do I even have a shot at chief resident
Alex, you didn't. You're gonna be fired.
I'm gonna be chief resident.
Yeah, not if you don't work here anymore.
He solicited a patient for money.
No, my African kid thing.
It's against so many rules.
Who cares? The old hag could die,
But instead, she'll probably leave it to her cats,
Uh, hey, everybody. Off. Now.
Callie.
I did four laps today.
Sofia needs surgery.
What?
Today. Now. She has weakness in her left ventricle.
Not Ellis.
It's Meredith. I'm her daughter.
Ellis is gone. She died.
Please give me back my husband.
Please...
give me back my husband.
I mean, what am I supposed to say.
"Sorry. Never mind. Lack of funds.
Keep your dying kids where they are"?
Well, yeah.
No. You say "I'll pay you when you get here.
Keep the receipt. Send me the bill."
Right now they're eating $8 airport hamburgers
Great.
Maybe you can help me find a clear route to the CIA drop-off.
Looks like they're doing some serious renovations down here.
Listen to me carefully, Leon.
Your mission has been aborted.
The U. S. is going to pull out of the country.
What? I just got here.
After taking me off furlough and sending me to this
What the hell?
Washington and the government there have decided to go their separate ways.
Everyone has to leave, not just embassy staff
I don't give a damn about the politics.
If we don't stop them now,
Do you really wanna see that?
This is a war and things are different.
No one can do anything without backup from the American government.
Not even you.
Well then, I guess my only option is to
Leon!
She can tell them I got lost and missed my flight.
Better hurry up and get this done.
I need some breakfast.
Scarecrow.
I'm the Tin Man. Can you talk?
I don't want to cause any more trouble.
It's time to say goodbye.
Wait.
You know, I didn't really care about independence.
All I wanted was to have fun with you and my friends.
And..
I was looking forward to showing you America.
Trust me,
The person who released the Plaga.
Just as I thought, you haven't a clue.
I am the president of this country.
So that's what Ada meant.
He is an enemy of the state. Kill him!
Creatures broke through
Open fire!
Cease fire. Cease fire.
Help me!
Help!
What will you gain by killing me?
Have you thought this through?
Who will lead the country once you gain independence?
You?
I have no intention of taking advice
In case you're interested,
have been happening in the world.
We don't have time to fight amongst ourselves
Shut up!
Oh, great. It just keeps getting better.
We have to go.
Svetlana!
A biohazard release has been detected.
Okay, this is only a dry-run, and it's the first of many.
Won't be perfect, but once we start,
Agreed?
Okay.
Let's go.
Yep.
It makes a weird kind of sense.
If you plan on sawing a person in half,
When you take the stage and all eyes are on you,
Three days ago, I received a call
A consult was requested for a 35-year-old male patient
You only want them to see the magic.
Seconded.
Traditionally, a tumor like this
There's got to be something better than that.
Torres thought so, too.
She had a better idea.
Nobody was listening to each other.
Danielle hit her trick too soon,
Are you kidding? We were in the final round!
We were about to qualify for Nationals!
Slight tenderness to the abdomen,
Oh, my God. Dani, are you okay?!
Everything hurts.
I'll grab it if you let me watch.
The bone-graft retrieval.
Sorry, we're a military hospital.
I-I see mostly trauma-related patch-up jobs.
You have a reputation for a much more refined approach.
My reputation? I have a reputation?
I Googled you.
I mean, I Googled all of you.
Everyone's really excited about the surgery.
We don't get a lot of chances
Um, you know what? Yeah. Sure.
You can watch.
Thank you.
Could she flirt any harder?
What? Nobody's flirting with anybody.
Oh, come on. "I Googled you"?
She was totally flirting. So were you.
I was not! What did I even say?
You didn't have to say anything.
All of this..is a flirt.
I'm gonna need you to be still.
I mean, she barely even looks hurt
Maxine screwed us.
Danielle's the one who threw us off.
She didn't put her weight in her heel
What? Are you trying to break it more?
I am so over them.
We have worked too hard and sacrificed too much
They are out.
Down.
That girl is the reason I hated high school.
What a power trip.
She can't just kick somebody off the team.
Are you kidding me? She's the power center here.
She's cheer captain and squad leader.
What's the difference?
You see the way they all look at her.
She's the top of the social food chain.
She calls all the shots, decides who's in, who's out.
She says jump, they ask, "Off which bridge?"
D-Do you need something?
Yeah, I-I need you.
Where the hell is Mitchell?
I think you should call it. H-He's been down a long time.
Shut up. Just shut up, please.
I think I got a faint pulse.
I think that's your pulse you're feeling.
I got to open him up now. If I don't, he's dead.
Again, I'm not gonna allow you
I've got no way to dock the leg.
We don't have a fallback plan here.
Okay, I need you to hear me.
This is not a matter of confidence, okay?
It's not me. It is the bone.
I am saying that, with the pelvis that I have left,
Well, you better do something.
She's right. Look, if we stop now,
He's not gonna survive the night.
Yes. The young lad there.
I will. Thank you.
You should have a cloak for a day like this.
Eramcis will take care of me.
Ve are to be married soon.
Good-bye.
Come on, a decent wage.
Make your family proud.
Food, shelter. Who will join us?
Go and wake up the other farms!
Get them down here! We need more hands!
We need more men now!
Wake them up!
Go and get the Smith brothers first.
We lose the barn, we lose everything
Look sharp, men, the farmer's here.
Mr. Oak, is that you?
Perhaps you want a shepherd, ma'am?
I owe you an immense debt, Mr. Oak.
You are dismissed.
Get out while you can, if I were you.
Now you've all met our new shepherd, Mr. Oak.
You understand your duties, Mr. Oak?
If I don't, I'll ask, ma'am.
He's rich, he's handsome. He sends the local girls mad.
The Taylor sisters worked on him for two years.
Jane Perkins spent 20 on new clothes
It's said, when he was young, his sweetheart jilted him.
People always say that.
In rejecting you, perhaps?
I've long given up thinking of that.
Or wishing it, either.
But I will say this.
Leading on a man you don't care for is beneath you.
I cannot allow a man to criticize my private conduct.
You will please leave the farm at the end of the week.
I'd prefer to go at once.
Then go. I never want to see your face again.
Very well, Miss Everdene.
Whoa, there we are. There.
What's wrong with them?
They broke fence and ate the young clover.
Makes their stomachs swell.
What can we do now
You mean they're all going to die?
I hope I didn't startle you.
We've got hitched together somehow.
Here, allow me.
No. No. FPlease, let me do it myself.
If you lift your foot for a moment.
FPlease don't stare
I don't think I've ever seen a face as beautiful as yours.
You shouldn't be here. Please let me have the lamp.
A mighty impressive harvest this looks like.
Miss,
Sergeant Francis Troy.
Noble blood, full of promise. Very sharp and trim.
Well-educated.
There was good things expected of him.
e threw it al in to be a soldier
I'm going to tell him to leave.
I must absolutely insist that you leave at this very moment.
I can't.
Will you follow me, please?
What angers you, exactly?
I'm quite happy to walk by myself.
You should have nothing to do with him.
He's not good enough for you.
He's a perfectly decent man.
That's not what I believe
Frank, perhaps we ought to.. No.
Darling, it's our wedding celebration.
It will not rain tonight. My wife forbids it.
Now if you'll excuse me.
Friends!
One more thing
The finest bottles of French brandy,
Cheers! To your health!
That's a great responsibility, sir.
fHonsense.
No reason why a man of your ability
And why shouldn't there be stronger links
A share of my profits.
Miss Everdene needs me here.
And her farm will have priority.
I'd still need Miss Everdene's permission.
But, of course.
Of course, I wouldn't dare do anything
Georgie!
Had to go all the way to Norcombe Hill
You pleased?
Yes, sir, very much.
You will, sir.
Hey, Georgie.
Come on. Come on.
Gabriel, you're getting on in the world.
Of course you must accept the offer.
Only with your approval.
If I lose the farm, there may be no future
You know where my loyalty lies.
You're a man of great talent, it's only natural using it right.
Yes. Very much.
Which is it? Like or respect?
It is difficult for a woman to define her feelings
If you worry about a lack of passion on your part,
don't mind.
When must you give your answer?
By Christmas.
It's a terrible responsibility.
I hold that man's future in my hands.
His sanity, too, perhaps.
Could you care for him?
You may suppose love is wanting
Why are you asking me?
I need someone who's objective.
Well, I accepted you, Han.
Yes, thank you. You make my heart sing.
Woo!
Hurts me still.
That was like watching someone club a baby seal.
Why wouldn't you just say yes to his friend request?
Because I never check facebook, why would I?
So some girl i worked at a movie theater with in 2005
Maybe someone just post on your wall.
You have an air conditioner that works?
Oh, it works.
That's like an A.C. That just had salami.
There's more salami where that came from.
And my feet hurt.
I mean, I can't believe it.
Didn't you see me crying?
Lots of people cry at Goodwill.
You go to France, you eat snails. You come here, you cry.
That's odd, you didn't even react.
You need to react when people cry.
I did, I rolled my eyes.
Look, eventually, you'll learn to do that on the inside.
Okay, well, just FYI,
Are your girlfriends black drag queens?
Oh, awesome Strokes tee.
I went to this concert, but I couldn't afford the shirt.
Oh, we're done with me.
I went to see them on this tour the summer after my jumior year.
It was a really warm night,and I snuck out of the house,
Whatever.
And what?
What, did something great happen the night you got the T?
Look at me, does it look like something great ever happens?
Hey, cute tee. Had my eye on it.
That's not me, that's the law of the 'will.
Yeah, you better walk away.
That was intense.
Just another Wednesday at the 'will.
You said to look in things, right?
Max, look. On my first try!
Ooh, slick. Whoever hid those is gonna be pissed.
Quality check.
Fabric sturdy, no mysterious crotch stains,
And look, they're designer.
Summer 2009. $350.
And for me today...
$5. That's a reduction I like.
These are from the gentleman with a sweet note,
Same face, no sound.
Oh, my God.
I can't believe it, it's the girl from the 'will.
I got your back, gir-r-r.
What is up with that?
I don't know, man, I'm just used to it.
That's what you'd sound like, if you talked.
I agree with you, by the way.
Everything you say is right, Max.
Thank you, Chestnut.
You should kill her.
Chestnut! I can't do that.
It'll be easy. We could kill her and eat her.
Chestnut!
All right, buddy, here's your spot.
Come on, do your business.
How could there be?!
With these constant interruptions.
I love him, but if he's broken, let's not get a new one.
What are you doing? It's time to go.
I'm not going to work today.
And would you like to know why?
Ah, you're upset because you spent the whole night working
Like a big old baby.
Call me if you need anything.
Hmm, it would.
Okay, back to "Emily or Cinnamon""
That nagging tone is helping my anxiety, yeah.
But if you could maybe just go ten percent less shrill,
I'm sorry, but you know we agreed
There you go, perfect.
Sheldon, stop it, I'm not kidding.
Take the cap off, and put the notebook away.
But after months of struggling, I'm finally making progress.
You don't need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive.
Or do I, hmm?
Sir Isaac Newton wrote his Principia
That's not true.
Yeah, well, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
Sophie, are those all your bridal magazines?
That's only half.
Come on, Oleg!
Look, if those are too heavy, how are you going to be able
Wedding donkey?
My excitement level for this wedding just skyrocketed.
Relax, Sophie.
If I know how to do anything, it's how to move an ass.
That's true. Yeah.
Wow, you're carrying more heavy issues than Amanda Bynes.
Look at all these. Beautiful Bride,
And do you really need African American Bride?
It's 'cause our T-shirts got ripped off
It's like a bad 80's movie.
I don't know whether to date James Spader
This is so unfair.
Those girls can't just steal from us.
This isn't 7-Eleven.
Hey, everybody.
I'm up to my nuts in bridal junk.
The love of my life.
The yin to my yang.
The zing to my wang.
Save that gold for the vows.
I am Svetlana, Oleg's cousin.
Well, darling, it could be worse.
You could be his sister.
What is going on here?
There's food waiting in the window,
Someone's on his periodical.
Han, we just got served.
At least someone in the diner has.
You're lucky your boss is so chill.
Of course you're chill, you're one of Mr. Popper's penguins.
How about this?
We'll do the jobs you already pay us for
You have a suit, right?
Why would I pretend to be a lawyer?
You can't even pretend to be waitresses.
No one's gonna believe Han's our lawyer, anyway.
He can't pass the bar, he can barely see over one.
And this area is for customers.
I want these out of here!
Max?
I suppose I could dig up a suit if that could, somehow,
Max, of course these girls go to Dalby Hall,
I guess Lady Gaga won in the end, though.
In other news, I kind of like this eye-patch.
I know you do, you were pretending to be
How long did the eye doctor say you have to keep it on?
And by eye doctor, I mean that first-year med student
A few days, which is a bummer,
How are we gonna find them?
Follow the scent of our decaying T-shirts business?
According to Instagram, they're in the cafeteria, see?
Ashlin just posted a pic of a mini-pizza.
Second place. $250.
And next Halloween, you can wear that
Okay, so the plan is, we go in there
I'll do the talking.
Han, you stand there and try to look smart.
Ah. I'm already Asian. So, done.
Wow, this brings me back.
I had a seat at the popular table,
and the Waiting For Marriage table.
