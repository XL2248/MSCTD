He diagnosed Andy with growing pains.
But, you know, I grew up,
Your pain is dramatic to me.
Andy. your mom's right.
It's a good thing that you came.
Okay, thanks, because it does hurt.
Everything hurts, all the time.
Okay. Well, I'm gonna give you a quick exam,
I know. I'll be all right.
This doesn't feel real.
Does this feel real to you?
No. I don't know.
Oh, crap.
Does your friend have any allergies,
Is she on any medication?
She's not our friend.
Jasmine! we barely know her.
We met her on the plane from sydney.
We're backpacking, seeing the states.
So we hardly know her.
We're just traveling mates.
She's really nice, though.
All right, let's move.
A name. uh, can you give me that?
She's gonna wake up in a lot of pain
I'm heading back to surgery.
Patient is george o'malley, 29.
Procedure is organ recovery for donation.
I will call on the receiving surgeons.
Kidneys.
St. luke's children's. boise.
Who is it for?
Sorry?
who are his kidneys for?
I gave all that to the nurse.
I would like you to tell me.
8 years old, hypoplastic kidneys.
Thank you.
Lungs?
Lungs and heart are going to portland medical center.
Terry class, age 22.
Cystic fibrosis.
You are evil. you are the devil.
I am. I admit it.
Cristina, you know the rules.
Oh, the rules are stupid.
Mm. so you're saying my shrink's stupid? hmm?
And I am trying to just take a minute.
So, Derek, please..
Back off.
You want a ride home?
I was gonna clean out his locker,
I was about as good a friend to him
I just.. I... I abandoned him completely.
I-I-I just.. moved out
I don't understand.
And Dr. Webber said I should talk to you.
Mrs. O'Malley, I didn't know him like you knew him.
I didn't know him long,
He.. he was very fast on his feet,
He had tremendous potential.
And..
You know, he was impatient.
He wanted to become better faster.
He wanted to save more lives.
He was good.
And he was thoughtful and generous.
And I think in the end, I think...
I think he was heroic and noble.
And I liked him very much.
And I think he gave you good reason
Hey. I'm, uh, headed out.
I just wanted to say goodnight. night.
You two know each other?
Yeah. Dr. Webber and I go way back, huh?
We worked together for, what was it, five, six years?
Yeah. You know, I hate to say it,
And this being a teaching hospital,
So you know how to do sutures, right, Dr. Mckee?
Damn straight.
Great. Good seeing you, chief.
Look, doc
It's, uh, it's my eighth.
What kind of sutures are you using?
Uh, 3
Thanks.
Can you hand me the shampoo?
Thank you.
Are you really gay?
Like, how gay are you,
'cause that's my boyfriend in... in the shower,
Ho... how gay are you?
Well, anyone else I can offend?
A tethered spinal cord?
one of the threads in his spinal cord
Normally the spinal cord is free at the end,
Thus the excruciating pain.
I'll snip the tethered cord and he'll be free of pain.
She's not normally like this.
Before all this,she was, like a normal mom.
Andy this is a normal mom.
Are we waiting for dr. Swender?
No. dr. swender has handed you off to me.
Wh-what are you,like,second year?
Third.
Can we page dr. swender or something?
Stevens this is a good thing.
It is.
You still have cancer,
It is a good thing.
You died in my arms.
You freakin' died and then you left instructions
You want to know what I'm scared of?
I'm scared of everything!
I'm scared to move! I'm scared to breathe!
I'm scared to touch you!
I can't lose you. I won't survive.
And that's your fault.
You made me love you,you made me let you in,
that's how you stay alive.
When it hurts so much you can't breathe
Miranda.
By remembering that one day,
The trick was so shocking
I, uh, don't think it's working.
Oh, well, I mean,
You just move your... Yeah.
.... arm around to keep it going.
I should probably get going.
Mother's waiting in the truck.
..And she's patient until she isn't.
Oh, and I've got to get to work, too,
It's pretty hard to concentrate with all the bathroom crying
Have a good one.
I will.
Wow. Those are nice.
Yeah, they were on the front porch.
They're from a mystery admirer.
The card says, "You don't know your power."
Yeah, don't ask who they're from,
What happened to your arm?
Oh, I am winding an old watch
Oh. That's pretty uneven. You gave her this awesome swing.
Man, where did mom find a guy as sweet as you?
Actually, she hit me with her car
We may not get women,
We may not hook up with women,
I think it was clear when I said that.
So, what's with this whole "going out early" thing.
Well, it's been forever since we've had a date-night out,
Ugh, pathetic.
Okay, we get to say that, not you.
No, no, no, it's Dylan.
He texts me every Valentine's day begging to hook up.
Oh, that is sad.
I know. It almost never works.
All right, you old bags,
Sal, what are you doing here?
It's Valentine's day and my
The first part's true.
Well, actually, we have plans.
Aw, but now you have better plans.
Ms. Clarke, sorry for the trouble.
May I have that back?
Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry.
I didn't know that real humans could have these dimensions.
Thanks.
Thank you.
I seem to have dropped my spare hotel key.
Phil
No need to call whoever this Phil is.
You're in no danger.
This key is to room 422 at the Ramada down the street.
Slip out when you can.
I'll pre-disable the smoke detectors
For the past several Valentine's,
This hotel has a very short memory
Claire, you have to finish signing these contracts.
Hey, Phil.
Phil? No.
Name's Clive, friend.
Say, maybe you could take over here for a bit.
I'll make sure the boss lady's back in one piece
Hi, Phil.
It's Clive, actually.
Apparently they have a thing like how you and your sister
Oh. Uh, Claire, your 2:00 is here
Phil, look, I really appreciate this. I do.
It's just that
Turns out my admirer
I may have a sad love life, but I don't need my mommy
And if you really want to give me some confidence,
First of all, I didn't give you those flowers.
Second of all, there is a picture of you.
Where is it?
Yes, hello.
I've got a meeting.
Ben, you're gonna finish the contract stuff.
Margaret, you're gonna take Alex.
You're gonna find out who's using our account for flowers, okay?
Phil, honey,
Do I know that guy in the cloak?
Ah, hinge specialist. You might've seen him around.
He's the guy for offbeat swivels
I've got it all planned.
This whole Clive thing wasn't even necessary.
Claire was taking me out to dinner all along.
Romance strong as ever.
Margaret, get a reservation
I've got too much going on to even think about it.
Werner is great.
You know, he's a rich musician,
Well, um...
... This has been fun, but we should, uh...
You're not going anywhere, carrot bottom.
Oh, my god. Is that Rainer?
Why is he with another woman?
That sounds cheat-y.
Hey. Margaret said you keep the phone records.
Why? What do you need them for?
I'm still trying to find out who sent me those flowers.
You keep them in here?
No, don't.
Don't.
Ben, why do you have this photo of me in your desk drawer?
Who would bully you?
So, I heard there was going to be this big ice-skating party.
Oh, my God. It's already gotten, like, eight likes.
Despite our failure in Russia,
They believe Hassan had been working with this man,
He's a French national who's been trading illegal arms
Victor has recently stepped up his game into the nuclear arena
For years, he's worked hand in hand with his brother, David.
There were reports of a power struggle between the two.
David didn't want his brother
Later he was almost captured by police,
Oh, that poor lady. Does anyone know if she's OK?
She's fine.
If Marquez finds those plans and sells them to Azar... Boom!
Our mission? Take down Marquez before he can locate the plans.
Do we know his whereabouts?
NSA believes he's headed to Berlin to meet with Azar.
Yes! Love Berlin.
Christina, you'll take it.
We also have intel from MI6.
That doesn't give me the right to disseminate it freely.
Come on. Look, the letter was found in Bernadette's closet.
Doesn't that count for something?
Are you pointing out that California
Yeah, obviously.
Well played.
Sometimes I don't give you enough credit, Penny.
Well, put your mind at ease.
I'm here to make sure your dinner party
Now, the first thing we need is a theme.
I'm thinking...
ah, turn-of-the-century Moulin Rouge.
I'm thinking you need a testosterone patch.
Penny and I just want to do something low-key.
You know, cocktails,
So your theme is
Hate to miss that.
Hey, where have you been?
Oh, Leonard.
If I was prone to sarcasm,
One, two, three, four, five,
I meant, "Golly, Sheldon,
They made me reveal confidential information
What information?
I can't tell you that.
I am bound by closet
Well, come on, we won't tell anyone.
Que sera. That's racing, I guess.
It's bad luck for the punters that they lose their money.
Fucking hell!
Ruuck!
Nathan, how are you going?
I'm alright. I've just... . just got a flat.
Oh, yeah. Need a hand?
Nah, all good. I got it.
No worries at all, mate.
She's given up on your whole pathetic act.
Do you know that you're the la..
Enough.
Why don't you and your deadbeat husband
Jack, you're my brother.
I can't just stand by and watch this happen.
Are you done?
Have you made that call?
What you're talking about is a one-way street. You understand?
Once you start, there is no going back.
She's had fair warning.
She knew the consequences and she did it anyway.
So fuck her.
You want my money or not?
Do you have that sort of cash just lying around?
About. $250,000.
Quarter of a million dollars.
And you just forgot about it?
We didn't have to kill her, did we?
What are you talking about?!
We could have used that money to pay Bruce.
By the time I found it, we were already committed.
Very convenient.
Believe me, there is nothing convenient
Hey.
I'm sick and tired of having barely enough.
I want more.
So should you.
I'm Off
Maybe.
Your business is your own.
As long as we're square.
You got some proof for me?
Or am I supposed to just take your word?
What, you don't trust me anymore?
I'd have thought you'd be glad to be rid of her.
Answer to all your problems.
Despite what you think,
Too much.
Well, you've got a crazy way of showing it.
Nobody makes a fool out of me.
It's gone.
I don't ike the sound of that.
Alice.
You wouldn't be playing games with me, would you, Jack?
Whac
At the safety deposit box at the bank.
ad me worried for a moment.
What time shall I come back tomorrow
Jet's make it 200.
Jack, all this talk of booze has got me quite thirsty.
You wouldn't know of any good bars in the area, would you?
Shit.
Hi, Bruce.
Where's Lucy?
Oh, she hasn't showed up for work yet.
You know why I'm here?
I'm here on police business.
You know anything about a crash?
Up on Devil's Rocks Road?
No. Should T
I found Lucy's car, or what's left of it.
This thing has insurance job written all over it.
So, how are we gonna do this?
Well, that's the easy part.
You just put the money on the ground
Hot a chance.
We do this face-to-face or not at all
I'll keep the memory card
Over my dead body.
Isn't that over your wife's dead body?
You go to hell!
You've got a bad attitude.
You don't really notice any of the scars.
Of course, she's fatter than my elephant
Well, the years can be cruel, Howard.
"Life is nasty, brutish and short," as the man said.
Was it Hobbes?:
I'd have got on rather well with Hobbes.
Shall we go for a drink?
The Catledge family are wonderful people
They're a wealthy Pittsburgh family.
TFather made millions in coal before he died
Now, the thing is, there's a young woman staying with them,
Oh, Lord, not another fake psychic.
What a pestilence they are.
They're taken with her predictions of the future.
Telling them what they want to hear. Precisely.
Hmm, and charging them for all the good news she brings.
Exactly right. And, of course, she's a pretty young thing
Brice Catledge, Caroline's brother,
Brice Catledge's sister Caroline
Oh, rubbish.
Doesn't he know that scientists are among the easiest to fool?
Well, this is the thing, I'm embarrassed to say,
I mean, I watched every move, and Lord knows,
I began to doubt my own clear thinking
Olivia and I were all set to take a holiday,
But you hate holidays.
You'll spend your whole time in your room practicing card tricks,
And besides, you've always loved the south of France,
But if this woman knows she's being watched by the great Wei Ling Soo,
The usual headaches, resistance in the room.
She'll never know you're Wei Ling Soo.
Don't get angry with me, Olivia. It won't be for long
You've always had the measure of me, Olivia.
Ever since our very first dinner,
Yes, you were very impressive.
Oh, it was simply a matter of logic and common sense.
Jittle Howard
Of all my nephews and nieces, you're the only one, Stanley,
Oh, I couldn't agree more.
If only you had a slightly milder disposition,
Oh, I am his friend. Notice I use the singular.
Yes, he means he can tolerate me.
George, Caroline, Stanley. How do you do?
Oh, hello. Stanley.
A great pleasure.
George. Charmed.
Of course, George and Caroline are the reason I'm here.
They're a great deal less gullible
When she fooled Howard Burkan,
I don't know if Howard told you, her name is Sophie Baker.
Have you heard of her or...
No, I have not, but these sleazy fraudsters change identity every month.
And I omitted to mention she's here with her mother.
Ah, now, that says a lot. Yeah.
Caroline, you were next to her.
She held my brother's hand, and she actually made the table rise.
Well, I looked for the usual devices, of course.
I thought maybe, wrist lifts, but they weren't there.
She's promised to try and make contact with my father,
As I was saying, your mother and your brother
There is, of course, no spirit world, and even if there were,
And, uh, how long will you be staying with us, Mister.
Oh, not very. I have business elsewhere.
Ah, have you told him about Sophie?
Ah, now, is this the girl that can read minds and such?
Well, she gets these sensory impressions. And, what are they?
It's hard to explain. She gets these mental vibrations.
Her head vibrates?
Drink? Thank you.
Have you got a whiskey, Brice? I absolutely do.
Now, Sophie looked into my eyes
About old girlfriends I'd had,
Good heavens. You think she can do it with me?
Oh, of course. Of course.
Sophie sees all.
She can predict the future. In short, she's a visionary.
And, I'm told she's very pleasant to look at.
She's a visionary and a vision.
Mother's agreed to subsidize a foundation
Oh, she's nothing I haven't seen before.
Pretty young thing with a stage mother who handles the promotion,
I want you to see her working
Well, I mean, she's not even a good actress.
"I... I get the impression of the Orient. China."
Well, I thought that was quite good,
Yes, it's all very tantalizing
And yet, she's a fraud, Howard.
Because there is no sixth sense.
There are five senses, and no spirit world.
Uh, yes, I had a bath. I had a little nap.
And now, you're refreshed.
Well, no, not entirely. I had an unpleasant dream.
I've had my share.
I dreamt I was being followed by a sinister Chinese.
You have the Far East on the brain.
What do you think it means? I don't know.
Good evening.
What? Oh, I was just..
I was receiving some mental impressions. Excuse me.
Come, Stanley, let's go to... You look stunned.
I had an uncle who drowned many years ago.
And when I mentioned him,
There's absolutely no way she could know that unless
I once raised a real tiger, but we both have our tricks.
There was nothing supporting this candle, no threads, no wires,
I... I was just telling Mr. Pepperidge here
"Apparent," I think, is the key word.
Is it "Pepperidge," or "Talmudge," or "Taplinger?"
I mean, I grabbed the candle and found absolutely nothing supporting it.
That's because there's nothing to find.
There is no metaphysical world.
What you see out there is what you get.
I think Mr. Nietzsche has disposed of the God matter rather convincingly.
Good morning.
Mmm.
What are you doing today?
I'm going bird-watching with Brice.
Do you want to join us?
I can't think of a more inane activity,
Why don't you join me instead?
Where?
She's a remarkable woman.
We could have lunch. Chat?
Actually, get to know one another better.
You think you'll trick me into showing you how I deceive people.
Come on.
I'm sure Brice Catledge can live
Tell me, doesn't it ever trouble your conscience
I could just as easily ask you,
Not if their hopes are false.
Even if their hopes are false,
Then you admit you're a fraud?
I wonder if you get your cynicism from your grandfather,
The missing toe.
Why are you staring at me?
Where are you from?
Any other way, lies madness.
You'd be happier if I was a fraud,
No, it's quite the opposite.
If you knew how much I don't want you to be a fake.
Oh, but think how embarrassing it would be for you.
Is that why Jenny dropped you?
How could you know about Jenny?
I see long, blonde hair.
A wonderful laugh.
Yes, she had a lovely laugh.
But who wants a pessimistic bore
CEO gets indicted for fraud.Investors start losing money.
Lots of money.
If I didn't know Burrows pulled that trigger,
We're talking half a billion dollars.
People have killed for a lot less.
Not a good position you find yourself in, is it?
Whites don't want you. Blacks don't want you.
You're just caught in the middle, aren't you?
Maybe you are in no position to be telling me my business. Hm?
That's what I thought.
I'm sure you can understand my reluctance to discuss past patients.
absolutely.
I'm not accustomed to making enquiries like this, but I..
I feel like I can get through to him.
I can help him.
I imagine he needs it in there.
What did you treat him for?
Michael suffered from a couple of things.
One was a condition called low latent inhibition.
Sorry. I'm not familiar with the term.
People who suffer from low latent inhibition see everyday things like you or I do
But where we just process the image of a lamp,
The stem, the bulb, the bolts,even the washers inside.
Their brains are more open to incoming stimuli in the surrounding environment.
Other people's brains
We have to do it in order to keep our sanity.
If someone with a low IQ has low latent inhibition,
Do you think Michael's a genius?
He came to me with absolutely no sense of self-worth.
The loss of both parents very often does that to a child.
But with the low latent inhibition,
He became very attuned to all the suffering around him.
He couldn't shut it out.
He became a rescuer,
I didn't know all this about him.
I hope you don't mind,
If's in my nature to want to help.
From what I understand it's in your nature too.
You did a lot of good things before you were in here.
Lot community work, lot charity work.
What happened?
The man you're talking about died the moment I stepped inside these walls.
All right.
Ladies and gentlemen,United States Secret Service.
Don't you talk to your guy friends about sex?
Who? Avery? No.
Well, you don't talk about
Maybe.
So you can do it with me.
Okay, fine. Your work's suffering so bad,
Ah, and yet you find inspiration in toothpaste.
Maybe next time, you keep it to yourself.
That works for you?
In a marriage? Yes. You keep your mouth shut.
Although, uh, kinda... Miranda's been, uh,
She has what, uh, if you squint real hard,
Bailey?
Yeah, she had that incident with the hole in the gloves.
I knew it freaked her out, but I was away.
I didn't know how much it freaked her out.
Just apologize, we feel terrible,
She'll be pissy, but she'll get over it.
Well, I could have Edwards tell her.
She's on her service.
Even better.
Yeah.
I need to put a gastro-j on the schedule.
And if I tell Grey she can't get into the O.R. until 7:00,
That means I have to work late.
You'll be working late anyhow
And to the people who count on you for support.
All right, all right, I will take it.
Thank you.
And Kepner invited me to her wedding.
Did she?
Plus one.
And you're gonna be invited... plus one.
Is she, like, expecting us to bring other people?
No, brides are weird. Go think about something else.
Please?
Okay.
Is he gonna make it?
Well, if Yang can get her act together.
Come with me.
Please.
That's Nathan. He's a real baby.
We're not talking about me. We're talking about him.
That's Ashley, his mom.
He has a very nice father.
This isn't a study, Meredith.
This is a baby.
Nathan is the first one in his family,
I mean, he's a baby.
Have you lost your mind?
Do you think that because I have kids,
No, I
Now you want me to shut down my entire study,
Baby Nathan and all of his college potential,
I apologize. I'll be over here.
You don't have to actually date the woman she chooses.
I don't wanna date any woman!
That's why she's doing this, Stan.
I thought you were gonna talk her out of it.
You need to tell her yourself.
You're both putting me in the middle.
Because she listens to you.
She doesn't listen to anyone!
Besides, this is not such a terrible idea.
I'm not a child she has to arrange daycare for!
A bunch of women she scared up on the internet?
This is.. it's awful.
It's taking her mind off what's actually happening.
That can't be the worst thing in the world.
She thinks she can find someone to replace her?
You can't... replace her.
Nobody can possibly replace.. her.
Why?
Why is this happening?
If we're gonna do this thing, we gotta do it now.
I can't. I don't have a conduit to put in him.
It won't be done for another six hours.
I don't know if he's gonna last that long.
Okay.
Okay, let's put him on an oscillator.
That's not your lunch, Sheldon;
As they were incorrectly sliced,
Isn't tomorrow your usual laundry night?
The supermarket was out of my regular fabric softener.
If this one under-or over-softens,
That's thinking ahead.
The alternative would be to think backwards.
That's just remembering.
So how's Amy?
Amy's changed.
I might have to let her go.
Oh, no. Why?
I thought she was a highly evolved creature
But recent events indicate that
we have to go outside.
No, it's chilly outside. Didn't bring my jacket.
Oh, for crying out loud.
What kind of superhero needs a jacket?
What kind of superhero says, "Dibs on the red tights!
Dibs on the red tights!"
Wait. Are we starting now? Or is that what you're going to say
I'm hanging up.
You got a number for a cab?
Anything I can do?
Bet I got you beat.
For worst day ever.
There's no way you could beat this one.
What, did your dog die or something?
Happy birthday!
Yeah, 23's kind of a big one.
Yeah, after the flood washed it away.
You know, food for the worms?
You've never heard of the Blackwater flood?
20-something years ago?
It was the end, all right.
There is no River's Ed
same as your house.
Unless you like old wives' tales.
Well, yeah, I might like them.
Don't shovel that shit to these kids, Lucky.
There's one story that says that house is still standing
If you believe stories for idiots and morons.
You got some kind of deed?
What do you mean?
It's a long shot, but we mapped something a few days
This is the old highway where the flood took it out.
See this path through the forest?
Something big definitely came through here.
Like it's holding on, just for me.
Stop right there.
Now turn around and walk away.
Look, don't get the wrong idea.
We're, uh, Public Land and Survey.
Who used to live here?
What the hell is that?
What's that in the chimney?
The deed you have to this house is
Look, I just want to know if people from my
Chairs, tables, chandeliers.
they shouldn't be here, Nick.
I thought you said that was you.
You said you'd been swinging a hammer in here for years.
I have.
I've been trying to tear it down.
Nick, let's go!
You tell you friend to run as fast and as
Nicky?
And you run with him, and never come back.
There's some guys out here!
You come back here, it'll be the ast thing you'll ever
They're trying to cut us off!
What the hell are these guys?
Go, go, go.
Ryan?
Yeah, I think.
What the fuck happened?
What?
What did he say to you?
He didn't say anything!
What did you say to him?
Get the fuck off of him.
Look, I do not know what's going on, OK?
Did he say something to you or not?
They don't even fucking walk upright.
Yeah, well, they know how to throw a fucking axe.
He's running something illegal out of that house.
Or he's just some hillbilly lunatic who thinks the state's
Oh my god!
Oh, shit!
Stop!
No one lives here, Evie, OK?
Trust me, no one.
Is anybody else thinking what I'm thinking?
Forest, ravine, car?
So the car could still be sitting there?
Well, should we try and see?
Come on, we'd never make it by dark.
And Evie can't make it anywhere right now.
Well, I would rather go into the woods than stay inside
Oh, in the same woods where they murdered Sam?
We don't need to broadcast ourselves.
How am I the only one that thinks this is a bad idea?
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
There is no way that I'm staying in there.
Stop it.
Look at me, OK?
Hey.
It's so good to see you with your eyes open.
How long was I out?
30 minutes?
Where's Ryo?
Uh, he and Lillith went to the van.
What happened out there?
You were touching the tree.
That tree's a hanging tree, Evie.
How would I see someone who's already died?
How would I see anyone?
I wasn't touching a person.
was touching a tree.
Do you remember touching the baby?
You said you never wanted to touch him 'cause you never
Is it something bad?
Is that what gave you the seizure?
All I saw was our baby.
I'm down here.
I remember when I used to call you that.
Mom?
What are you doing in there?
We're all trapped in here.
Your father, Nicky.
He's trapped in here, too.
The door to the cellar,
Are you really my mother?
I can't.
I'm not beautiful anymore.
Why?
What do you mean?
I mean, tell your friend to stop swinging that
I think you're looking at a door
Not with those roots jamming it shut.
Wanna give this a try?
Yeah, no telling what's down there.
They're everywhere.
They're all over the place.
It's crazy.
They're all over out there, just looking
They're all over the backyard, like statues.
Where the fuck do we go?
Where do you think?
We only have the cellar.
Go, go, go, go!
It's the door.
It's the door
What the fuck do we do?
For starters, we stay away from that fucking door.
Come on.
Where the hell are we gonna go?
Where the hell are we going?
I guess we're going back to the car.
You mean, if you hope it's still there.
Do not let go of my hand.
Yeah.
like Seth knew his real name.
Or he knew what he was.
We gotta find the girls.
No, but..
What are you doing?
I'm doing a search for the word Sammael.
Come on, we gotta find the girls.
S-A-M-M-A-E-L. It's a name from the Bible.
It's a poison angel.
"Sammael is one of the original angels of hell
Come on.
We gotta split up.
We can find....  we can cover more ground.
Jillith.
There's a glossary of demons.
The name Lillith is on here
She is the queen of hell.
Even in the womb, apparently.
They can feel stress, remember?
He feels everything I feel.
That's all it is.
He's 67.
he's just freaking out 'cause I am.
Hey!
It's me, Evie.
Don't scream.
Don't make any noise, OK?
You been wandering around all night?
We have to go to the house.
We have to find Hick
Hey, Cosmo, we're gonna need the second hose down here.
It'll just be a few more minutes.
What? Ain't nobody scared of a little poo.
Okay, I am deathly afraid of a lot of poo.
It's more poo than canoe in there.
Two kids shit the van on the way here and we still made it.
And I don't want to be Patient Zero for a pink eye epidemic.
So just calm down.
Call and have them send the van to pick you up.
It's dead!
I had 90% two seconds ago.
Piece of shit Boost Mobile.
Mine's dead, too.
Oh my God, it's Independence Day.
It's June, Gabriel!
Oh, wait, maybe North Korea's invaded!
Then let's go.
I hope they got a McDonald's in here,
Hurry, come on. Gotta get inside.
Come on. I know Giucci's downstairs, let's go.
Yo. You guys...
How do you think an alien would do against this?
I wrote it down for you.
I got you, brother.
Oh, my God. Thanks. Thank you.
Hurry up.
Okay. Okay. Three, two, two, one..
I got 'em! I got 'em!
It is imperative that they are inserted at the same time.
Oh, shit, he passed out again.
I thought he needed one.
I should've pushed harder.
Hell yeah, you should have.
And...
And then I was stuck waiting
Papo, Cheo and Sammy.
Look, I know what you're thinking,
By 2:00, everyone should be out in the courtyard
You sure it hasn't started already?
Someone went outside the ring to settle a dispute.
Stop. You're hurting my feelings.
I've seen at you're capable of,
You think I killed Tyge?
I saw the two of you in the courtyard this morning.
I was trying to be Nice to him.
He started with me.
Well, if you didn't kill him, who did?
Not me.
Come on, Brad.
Who wanted him dead besides you?
You really think I killed that frog?
How many times have I had you at gunpoint?
You think I didn't want to pull that trigger?
Hell
Hey, you seen anyone see Whistler go down the stairway?
We only been out here a minute.
Well, hurry up, then.
The sooner Whistler dies,
Either way, you're getting in the ring with me today.
I mind that you kept it from me.
What difference does it make?
I mean, we're done by tomorrow, right?
No more surprises, Lincoln.
What? Say it.
Can you get any more pictures of Sara?
Alive? No.
You didn't tell him.
You didn't tell Michael that Sara's dead.
Can we get pictures or not?
I'm sure we can cobble something together,
He seems a little sensitive to me.
This is the exchange point L-J and I will be waiting.
We're not, we're not planning,
Leave my son.
Living the good life, huh?
Is that what this is?
Having too good a time here
Well, I needed some time
Yeah, I'm sure it was really hard
I'm gonna be honest.
I was looking forward to seeing you
Can we just save all this till after
Made up your mind yet, Alex?
Eight years, minimum security.
And I leave for the US tonight?
Once the special
you'll be on your way.
What about a special prosecutor?
You stand in front of a guy,
It's a formality.
"It's a formality"?
This is just a formality?
You know, if it were up to me,
But the Justice Department
Alex, this is a hundred percent above board.
You've made a lot of mistakes in your career.
You know it and I know it,
I've got eight files in my office attesting to that.
And if you don't take this offer,
I know who killed that man.
I'm sure you do.
Lechero
I found this
Convenient
Let's try it again..
Escaping together, but properly this time.
How about you learn to fight first?
Well, well.
The first Master. Right?
Where were you these past few days, huh?
I saw you were allowed off the compound. What were you doing?
Nothing.
I have no time for you guys.
Um, do you wanna take a chair while I have a look at you?
It hurts.
Do you want to take your hand away?
That doesn't look too bad
Tell me where your brother is.
Tell me where your brother is.
He's gone south a long way from here. I'll take you to him, I promise.
I'm just gonna get you a T-shirt.
Get up. We're leaving
Get up.
I just asked that lady how to get to Carloon from here.
I was gonna do that anyway and you would've heard me
I was gonna tell you anyway.
You wanna know so bad
You don't know exactly where in Carloon we're going,
I had a pain in my side real bad.
It's starting to hurt.
I think maybe I gotta do something with it
Let's put that bandage back on.
think it broke, man.
You got any fuel?
50 US
What's wrong with Australian money?
Either take it Or leave it.
It's paper. It's worthless.
Yeah, whatever, mate, I don't care.
It's a piece of fucking paper!
Take it or leave it.
How much you need, man?
50 US
Yeah
And a box of 9 millimeter for my friend here.
Thank you kindly.
Shut up.
You act like they're doing you a favor to let you work there,
How do you know about the picnic?
I know everything, Jerry.
I'm not talking to you.
They'll mock you the second you leave the room, Jerry.
You're crying right now, liar.
Come on
Before we break up here, I wanna go over
We're... . we're just gonna go around the table, okay?
Can your comment wait?
I just wanna say that the picnic
We all wanna get out of here, So..
John, you'll be setting up the barbecue grills
Any questions?
Oh, yeah.
I've got an idea while we were sitting here.
Mmm, like at a wedding?
Or a cruise ship.
It's really easy. Anyone can conga.
I'll set my head on fire before I conga.
Men are afraid to dance. The male ego is too fragile.
In her eyes, you're a ridiculous peasant.
Oh, Oh, yeah. Guess what.
I'm not a peasant, Mr. Whiskers. Himm?
I'm thinking that this is a real good time for a walk, Jerry.
I think that's a fantastic idea
She drinks tea in carriages and fucks men
Come on, Bosco. Let's go, buddy.
Come on.
Okay, I'll tone it down a little bit.
You have the greatest hair, Tom.
n the back. It's awesome
Yeah, but it's more than just egg rolls and fortune cookies.
Do you wanna go?
When?
On Friday night. I'll pick you up after work.
No, it's... it's all right. I don't need a lift.
Or just meet there, then?
The show starts at 7:00.
There's a show
The best spectacle in the world.
This is the real you.
This is exactly who you are
What happened?
What do you think? David lost it.
I tried to fend him off, and he..
I don't believe you.
10olx at me
I told him you were leaving..
You told him? Why would you tell him that?
Because you wouldn't have.
don't want to talk about it.
What, she didn't come to pick you up?
Just let it go, okay?
Hey, I'm here as a friend. Nothing else.
Now, come on.
Move over.
David, come on, you had to see this coming
But funny,
How? He told me what happened with your mom.
Why would you keep that a secret?
I wouldn't have cared if you had ust told me.
I was ashamed, okay?
was ashamed
And I hated what I did.
If you thought I was such an angel
So that's it? You're just gonna walk away?
I know I'm not good enough for you.
But I'm not gonna spend my entire life proving that I am.
You're a coward, you know that?
You don't fight for love.
You're terrified of it!
I'm sorry. Do you want me to leave you alone?
No. I'm just missing home.
Time helps.
It's slow and it's painful, but it works.
Talking hel ps.
Going out with other people, seeing friends.
I can't, David. I'm so sorry.
Anne, please.
David didn't get into UGA
Uh, no, I didn't.
Although I'm not surprised
It's why I called Helen and she said she never got my letter.
You told me it went out with the mail
How could you have fallen this far?
Just hear me out, okay?
Two tickets.
We can leave tonight. We could go anywhere.
This isn't over, Tade
haven't moved on.
And I don't think you have either.
Do you love this other guy?
Do you love him like you love me?
Do you?
Were you driving the MG?
No, it must have been Keith.
This is the one.
When the CD player blew, we had to bring all the records downstairs.
It's awesome.
What are you doing in here?
We were just listening
Oh, look at this. You scratched it.
You're supposed to put them back in the sleeves immediately.
Dad, they're just records.
These are just things. He'd want us to play them.
He's not here to ask, is he?
No, I guess he's not.
It was going pretty well till we ran into you.
tried to warn you.
I'm just giving you a hard time, that's all.
I know it's not your fault.
Fate conspired.
Isn't that always the way?
You know, believe it or not, before I ended up here,
in a gospel band.
Yeah.
Me and my Gibson and Jesus were gonna rock the world.
But, you know, got married and had a kid, and...
Those were the days, though.
You guys are the best.
What's with the clothes?
Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work,
I meant why are they folded?
But whatever.
Ooh, what's this?
That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.
My date would've had to clean that up.
Ooh, I have an idea.
Maybe we can have, like, a prom do-over.
Oh, that would be so much fun.
We could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos.
Ooh, and get our hair done, and slow-dance.
Okay, guys, trust me,
You went to seven proms?
Yeah, let's see.
Uh, four "Under the Seas, " Two "Enchanted Evenings, "
Hey, where's Bernadette?
She and Amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing.
Oh, yeah, I got that Evite.
Ever since I saw Pretty in Pink,
But then I saw Carrie,
But then I saw Never Been Kissed,
This prom thing's been a real roller coaster.
Bernie's really excited.
I-I could tell because her voice got so high,
I'm not the best at reading facial cues,
You know, if you're not gonna learn how to do this,
Bruce Wayne doesn't wear a clip-on.
Bruce Wayne doesn't make his roommate tie it for him.
His name is Alfred, and, yes, he does.
There, perfect.
What, are you sure?
It's my first prom, I want to do it correctly.
I thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien.
I was, but Penny didn't want to.
You didn't want to.
Bernadette, Amy,
And even I knew it was weird to hire somebody.
Was that a flask?
Yes.
I've decided to embrace all of the traditions
You're gonna put alcohol in the punch?
Oh, no, this is pomegranate juice.
If you had ripped ieans and a leather jacket,
So, anything else planned for tonight?
Oh, everything.
Getting our picture taken, slow-dancing,
Pointing out that kings aren't elected.
It's gonna be off the hook.
And while you're at it,
Why would you say that?
You know, because..
because a lot of people lose their virginity on prom night.
Penny implied the same thing.
Is this true?
Just relax, it's a joke.
You don't have hormones.
Wow, you look amazing.
Oh, it's a scaly genital organ
Try not to touch it when you're dancing.
Excuse me.
Where are you going?
And for your information, Leonard,
But to be fair, the twins were a real handful that day.
You're making me worry.
What's going on?
What's going on is we're about to go to a prom.
And there's a great deal of pressure
What pressure?
All I said was you look handsome.
Can you please open the door?
It's not just that.
Leonard and Penny also made comments about it.
And I'm not blind.
Even I looked twice when I saw my posterior
So, I met Jeanie at your Aunt Gladys'.
She passed me the Manischewitz,
Is this what I sound like when I talk about India?
So, my mother's okay with this?
Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stuart?
Because they have a weird, inappropriate relationship.
You worry about getting your ass back in that seat in time.
If you pull this off, you can come up to my room later..
and the word "no" won't be in my vocabulary.
Just make sure we get paid.
In and out.
You know I can't get into that.
Now, we've been negotiating this for months.
I've jumped through all your hoops.
I've agreed to meet you here.
Do you want to sell the card to me or not?
Be right back.
That's a lot of secrets on a little piece of plastic.
Let me give you a little bit of advice.
And this is on the house.
Watch your step with that thing.
The Company will do anything to get it back.
Don't I know it.
The Allies spent two and a half years...
Planning the invasion of Normandy.
But on D-Day it came down to a handful of men..
On a strip of beach..
To decide the fate of the world.
What I'm getting at, Gretchen..
Is even the best plan is only as good..
As the moving parts on the ground executing it.
MS: I have info on Sara.
Michael
It's good to see you.
So where's your new best friend?
I don't know about that.
But Whistler's not who you think he is.
We're working together against the Company.
You kept your word to me.
You're the first that's ever done that. Gracias.
Why must you go after this man?
You could choose not to.
Where I come from, there's something called a blood feud.
Yes.
Michael Scofield left me for dead...
One too many times, as it turns out.
What is Spanish for "little angel"?
Angelita.
He was an independent contractor.
Who worked for the Company for about ten years.
He was assigned to retrieve Scylla once it went missing.
Do you know what Scylla is?
It's the Company's little black book.
So he was going to make a copy of it and give it to me.
What do you want from me?
You're looking at major time.
You know that, right?
So how would you like to walk away from it al..
not do a day?
All right. Sara Tancredi, last seen in Panama.
If you help me find her..
Maybe we've got a deal.
I'm sorry, she's not my department, Scylla is.
Then go find it yourself.
It seems to me..
The U.S. government should have a little more reach..
Get me back to the land 'o cotton.
Of course.
Ready.
Only a few people in government will know of the operation.
It has to stay that way...
Or people's lives will be in danger, mine included.
Taking down the company sounds a little bit more than a two-man job, no?
I'm going to get you help.
I thought you said, you couldn't trust anybody.
Yeah, but maybe you can.
All right, two of your cohorts..
Fernando Sucre, and Brad Bellick were arrested.
They're both facing time.
And Alexander Mahone is in a Colorado jail cell.
Good, let him sit there.
He was working with Whistler.
And you'll have me.
Okay? Whatever you need, I'll provide.
Whistler also said something about a second step,
Yeah, the card has all the data on it.
But it's encrypted.
I don't know.
So, we've got a data card, which could be anywhere.
And we've got to break into a building...
The location of which has yet to be determined.
Simple enough.
How do you know our dad?
He heard from contacts that I could be trusted.
Your father was a good man.
Why now?
Look, I've been going after the Company for five years.
Okay? When Whistler was killed yesterday...
The plug was going to be pulled on the entire operation.
But, uh..
I convinced my superiors to give it one more chance.
So this is like job security for you?
Well, when we go out there and risk our necks..
You can collect your pension.
No, no, no, Lincoln.
Okay, some people still care about their job.
Some people still fight for this country.
Maybe you've been a little too distracted..
You can look for Sara, if she's alive.
If we take this deal, we'll both be dead...
Long before I get the chance. Linc.
You guys must have some big-time friends.
What are you talking about?
Somebody just posted...
And there are some things...
You can't hide.
Know what I mean?
How high is your threshold for pain?
You sure you don't want a sedative?
We're gonna go into the night.
How do you feel?
Lighter somehow.
Look, I don't know how we're gonna take them down.
I don't even know who they are.
But I do know one thing...
But you can guarantee it'll be the federal, supremax.
No more updates.
Call me when they are dead.
Welcome to Los angles.
As it turns out, Men who have escaped not one..
And stay off the Company's radar.
You need to keep your heads down and your ears open.
We've provided cell phones, clothing, and toiletries.
All the basic necessities to get you up and running.
You patted these guys down before you let them in, right?
His suit, you don't buy a suit like that..
On a cop's salary or pulling weekend gigs as a driver.
That means he's full-time.
He's highly paid.
You ask our friend Mr. Self to run tax records.
In Los Angeles drawing a military pension..
And taking six figures from a private security company..
And you narrow your field from 10 million till about 50.
And then I can pick the guy out from there.
Find the driver, you find the Cardholder.
Mexican Desert, 60 miles south of US border.
We haven't ate or drank anything for days.
Oh, I don't want to die out here.
We ain't gonna die, Sancho.
Tell you what.
Why don't we rest here for a while, huh?
Travel at night when it's cooler.
Si, that sounds good.
What are we gonna do when we get there?
To San Diego.
You mean after Michael pays..
Will only last so long.
What does that mean?
I mean, then what if somebody finds out we're not.
What if we don't have to be in the house?
If the card, this Scylla is so important.
Maybe the guy is carrying it on him.
Well, according to public records.
And he's a CEO of a company called Spectroleum.
Heavy hitter like that's gonna have security 24-7.
And we gotta get this thing..
Without anyone knowing it's gone, right?
So even if he's got it on him, how do we get it off him?
You don't steal the card.
You copy it.
Oh, now you're interested in what I gotta say, right?
Copying it will make it harder.
Not only do you have to steal it.
You have to return it, genius.
Only if you don't got me, hombre.
What's that?
This is the reason I got busted.
Oh, yeah, yeah, no.
I'm looking at federal time cause I stole a cell phone, seriously?
I invented this
It looks like a cell phone but it's really like...
A digital black hole.
Wireless hard drive that swallows up any electronic data...
Within ten feet of it.
Like what?
Like the account info..
Of anyone at Starbucks with a latte and a laptop.
Like the PIN number of any credit card used at a gas pump.
I can walk out of here and get the identities.
And financial statements of ten people in ten minutes...
On a slow day, with one hand on my junk.
And the information embedded in Scylla?
If we can get close enough...
It's ours.
Just a matter of whether you do it before or after..
I shame you in front of your coworkers here.
Tell me where the Company keeps the box, Jasper.
Could be anywhere, I don't know.
Somebody does.
Right?
Somebody that you might have access to.
You know, if you go down this road.
Your government job won't protect you.
Then I better not get caught, right?
If I don't find something to eat soon.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.
We're not gonna make it.
We just got to keep talking. Sancho.
Keep our brains focused on something other than..
Our empty bellies and our dry mouths, okay?
Come on.
Let's start with, uh, your-your favorite color.
I'm hungry, Teddy.
Why should the both of us die out here.
When one of us could help the other one survive?
You don't want to do this. Please.
I'll make it quick. I promise!
Sancho.
Why'd you have to go and do something sos
It must be in there, right?
Look, there's no way we're getting...
In that house without being seen.
I know.
Well, if the card's in there, how we gonna copy it?
We're not.
She's gonna do it for US.
What're you reading?
"There is no fighting her."
I can never find a good bag.
I'm a teacher, and I have books and grading materials and...
I should probably go ahead and just invest..
In a wagon one of these days.
Yeah, that's why I love this bag.
It has so many pockets.
Do you mind if I take a look?
Oh, no.
Thanks.
Ah, thank God, thank God.
You all right, mister?
Yeah, my damn truck blew a gasket a few miles back.
Hello, I'm from the alarm company.
We've been receiving some, uh..
Strange signals from your property.
We'd like you to check the windows, please.
Make sure all the contacts are still active.
All the windows?
Yes, ma'am.
Every room in the house.
Okay, hold on.
Does she still have the bag?
Yeah.
She's got it.
Someone posted their bail.
I need to know who.
I'm showing a Bruce Bennett.
Former aid to Governor Frank Tancredi.
You think it fell out?
We looked everywhere.
You think we got the thing copied?
Like I said, I can't read the content..
Without downloading the device, but..
Then, yeah, I think we got it.
Doesn't matter if we got it if we can't find it.
Where the hell is it?
It's still inside the house.
That's why the maid went back inside.
She must have found it.
Assumed it belonged to her boss.
And then she left it behind.
Well, then guess what, fellas, it's game over.
You know how many months...
It took me to make that thing, Michael?
What, you just think I can whip up another one in a couple seconds?
Losing it is not the problem.
If they find it, that's the problem.
If they find out someone was after that card, we're done.
What do you mean, done? What does that mean?
Does that mean we're gonna go back to prison?
Are they gonna kill US?
Means we go in and get it.
If we had a few days, we'll figure out a way to pull this off.
But I gather we don't have that kind of time.
Yeah, you gather right.
Look, if you want US to get that device out of there.
You gotta throw Us a bone.
Give us some extra help.
What you're asking for requires involving additional people.
Which given the covert nature of this operation.
I cannot do.
Then you're asking for the impossible.
No, what I'm asking for is competence, okay?
I'm not the one who put the entire mission...
In the hands of a damn maid.
Look, if the Company finds that copy of Scylla before we do.
That's it, Michael, that's ball game.
They're gonna find out who was behind it.
What if our father after everything he discovered..
About the Company, what..
What if that's what he finally realized?
You know, uh, the one thing I remember most..
About Dad was the back of his head.
Always walking out the front door.
Always running from something.
Mom, US, himself.
But the one thing he never ran away from..
Was his belief that the Company needed to be taken down.
And we got an opportunity to do that.
Then this is our fight, not theirs.
Man, this ain't Fox River.
These guys chose to be here.
Remember that.
They got a choice.
Of the U.S. penitentiary in Livingston, Texas.
Where the brothers were allegedly sent.
There are still 105 inmates there.
And no one has been released during that time.
Someone is playing a shell game, Bruce.
I'm just trying to find out who.
I have no criminal jurisdiction over.
I know you bailed them out.
I know you've been in contact with Sara Tancredi.
Wanted to talk some more about what happened in Panama
How's that?
Because you're a little like me.
Because you're gonna say you're fine, that you can handle it.
So, um!
I'll just leave it at this.
I'm here.
Whenever you want to talk, I'm here.
But I also knew that if anything happened to me.
You were gonna blame yourself.
You would spend the rest of your life punishing yourself for it.
And, I can't bear the thought of that.
So can we make a deal right now that we're even.
And just wipe the slate clean and no guilt and no responsibility?
If we're gonna be together.
I don't want it to be out of a sense of obligation.
Or-or even that we should be.
Because of what we've been through.
I just want to start over.
Start over.
Okay.
Also, all electronic devices must be turned off at this time.
Our flight time to Atlanta is approximately 52 minutes.
Flight attendants, take your seats.
So what did you do last night?
I crashed, went straight to bed.
All right, here we go.
Engine instruments are in the green.
They're just cousins.
We need to get a move on.
The client's gonna come over to the apartment at 4:00.
I am swamped. I can't just leave.
Gloria, we're here to sell your apartment.
We don't work at the salon.
Well, I-I tried to talk about it this morning,
Uh-huh. I'm sorry.
Uh-huh, Jim sorry.
Did you say I act like my job is life and death?
Well, excuse me, my, my job is just death.
Yeah, that's right.
60 hours a week,
Which reminds me, I have a customer waiting.
I gotta get back to work.
No, I'll call you later.
David? David?
David, you're zoning out again.
I'm back, Doc.
So let me get this straight.
You found a John Doe in his 20s on the pavement near the Strip,
Sweat on the body bag
Dead men don't sweat, do they, Doctor?
About as often as they get up and walk away.
Have a trace of blood, as well.
That's from the liver stick puncture.
What'd you find in his pockets?
City bus pass. No particular route.
This old notebook,
"Stonewall 1/14, day seven.
Turn around and tell these guys
See how far you get.
Come on.
Maybe you ought to keep that to yourself.
DMV facial recognition?
Yeah. Yeah, it's worth a shot.
You know, I considered calling the DMV.
Half the people that work up there are the walking dead anyway.
Maybe they recognize this guy.
Uh, I got the DNA results.
Neither John Doe was in CODIS.
Hodges has a proposal:
Yeah, "Zombie DNA Index System."
He also wants you to know
The potassium and glucose levels are consistent with the living.
That's all you have for us?
Was dismissed by the scientific community.
but not without one big, fat scandal.
Rumor has it that Dr. Aden,
At least until one of his students
He was banished by the university,
So the government didn't want to step on the toes
All right, so our morgue zombie
There's got to be a connection.
Is Aden still around?
He still receives a government pension check.
And I was able to track down the address.
Hello, Doctor.
Casino's three miles further.
Dr. Aden?
Dr. Aden.. Uh...  we'd like to speak with you.
You got the wrong guy.
We're from the crime lab.
We found something of yours.
Lying government bastards!
They claimed that all of my papers had been destroyed.
Banished me from university property.
It was a good way to cut me out of the green and the glory.
It's Philo Farnsworth all over again!
I'm sorry. Where did you find this?
In the pocket of, uh, this young man.
Do you recognize him?
Uh-uh.. He's dead?
He's obviously on an autopsy table.
Actually, the young man in question...
.... arose.
The Lazarus myth made real?
Re-animation? This is getting more interesting.
It's, uh...
not as easy as you might think, bringing back the dead.
Treating the work as their own.
In your, um, re-animation experiments, Doctor,
I had the Ithaca of that most profound mystery within my sights.
Could almost reach out and touch it.
But I saw the storm clouds gathering.
The maelstrom.
For those not wise enough to pull their sails in,
It's a dead man's party.
Except the third person looks like a woman.
How could they do this?
What have they done?
If they've given it to some health club...
Dr. Aden, slow down.
Dude. You going to tell us what we're taking?
No need to add baggage to your trip.
Trust me, Kurt.
It's going to be an adventure.
It's time to put your cameras on.
See you on re-entry.
Godspeed, Alice.
Max's friends Kurt and Alice.
Maybe we can get access to Max's university email account;
See who his co-pilots were.
Yeah.
Blocking out all earthly stimuli.
You know, in the movie Altered States,
To strip the self down
You wouldn't want to go venturing，
Maybe the tank wasn't his idea.
I noticed some faint bruising that started to develop
So, I snapped some infrared photos.
Hand marks. He was held down.
That's one way to drown in just ten inches of water.
So drowning is COD?
Congratulations. You're batting. 500.
Yeah, great for a hitter, bad for pronouncing death.
Let me see your EKG.
What are you looking for, Doc?
Your zombie from the strip was under the influence of a paralytic,
The way you've got it set, it wouldn't pick up my heartbeat.
I'd be a flat-liner.
You're lucky you're not benched.
Could this cocktail produce, in certain individuals,
Why do you ask?
Well, one of our young explorers killed the other.
Well, I would have to know more about
There's no fighting in the war room, Dr. Strangelove.
I want you to look at something.
.... beyond our past journeys of the mind.
Tonight, we free ourselves from the physical plane.
Alice even plucked out the black ones.
She's got some academic honors awards,
A card from her mom's funeral five months ago.
Doesn't take a detective.
Mom's death took a toll.
Ooh, another one of Dr. Aden's notebooks.
Stand back, sir.
Dr. Aden said this was going to end badly.
We have two dead.
Let-s hope there's still time for Alice.
The notebook I found in Alice Katsu's room
It is a date-tag match to a formula
which means Dr. Aden wrote those notes recently.
Right.
The notebook was not among his archived papers.
So how did Alice get it?
From the doctor himself.
He and Alice were e-mail buddies.
She initiated contact five months ago.
When her mother died.
But Aden is not exactly advertising on bus benches.
Alice saw an anonymous commenter
She kind of felt like mr. Anonymous knew a little bit too much.
So she e-mails,
I was scanning through Kurt Dawson's video
So, here. Kurt's just wandering campus.
Then this happens.
Some kind of interference.
Yeah, Kurt's receiver picked up a signal from another camera.
I'm working on isolating the competing image,
Well, those are women's shoes.
Are we looking through Alice's camera?
She must have been in close proximity to Kurt,
Where is she, and what's she doing?
It's hard to say. But check this out.
What, a car stopped for her?
Weather radar, off. Landing gear, down.
Wipers, off.
Battery power, auto. External power source connected.
APU Fire Protection Test Button, check.
Flashlight, check. Escape rope, check.
Sichuan 8633, you are identified.
Climb to 3,900 meters, Sichuan 8633
When we get home, you'd better catch up on your homework.
This toy is for you.
Thank you!
Please sit tight and fasten your seat belt.
Sichuan 8633, contact Chengdu on 123.7. Goodbye.
It's 123.7. Goodbye, Sichuan 8633.
Setting 123.7.
Check.
Sichuan 8633, you are identified.
Continue to climb to 9,200 meters.
Pay attention to abnormal weather patterns in the Southeast region.
Sichuan 8633, do you confirm return to Chongqing?
Returning to Chengdu.
Affirmative.
Be careful of the turbulence.
Please return to your seat.
Please fasten your seat belts.
Sir, please be careful.
Come on. This way. Hurry up.
We will make an announcement when there is more information.
One moment, please.
We still need confirmation on this.
7W A81.
And that's when the dream that was Paul Young's life
Years later,
This woman had no identification,
And that is how people learned that Felicia Tillman,
I see you got the suit I sent over. You like it?
I like anything that's not orange.
Well, get ready to do all sorts of shopping.
Your settlement check came in.
So where you going first?
After all these years in prison,
All I want is to go home.
What? To your old neighborhood?
You sound surprised.
None of your neighbors supported you during the trial.
No one would blame you if you hated them a little.
Oh, I don't hate them...
A little.
And so my husband returned to Wisteria Lane.
The neighbors were surprised to see him.
They hadn't thought about Paul Young in years.
But he had thought about them.
And he was going to make sure
The phone call that comes in the middle of the night..
The letter that arrives by special courier..
The e-mail marked "Urgent!"..
Yes, there are all sorts of ways
It must be delivered in person.
Why do I have to tell them?
You said this couple lives in your neighborhood.
Trustees of the hospital feel
And just what am I supposed to say?
"Great block party.
"by the way. one of our nurses
Normally, I'd give you a hug,
Again, very sorry.
God! How am I gonna tell Carlos?
He is gonna be so angry!
And he'll probably find a way to blame me!
You'll never guess who's back!
Mom, we don't have any clean plates.
He paid in advance, and he didn't have pets. I didn't care.
How is Paul even out of jail?
That maniac was serving a life sentence.
Hello, ladies.
If you'd like to come in for a while,
I'll tell you the story.
Come on now.
It's a good one.
Felicia Tillman's alive?
Why are you so surprised?
I said that over and over again in my trial.
Oh, wait. That's right.
None of you could make it to the courthouses.
I told myself I'd explain how I was framed
In our defense, we thought you were a cold-blooded killer.
I missed my friends.
Innocent or not, that guy still gives me the creeps.
I can't believe paul young is back on Wisteria Lane.
And he's using my shower.
Jack!
You here for your 9 iron? Damn, I thought if I shaved,
Actually, I need to talk to you and your wife.
You look a little pa, buddy. Something wrong?
I think we should wait for gaby.
Jack, what's going on here, man?
You're making me nervous.
Let's just go inside, hmm?
No! This is impossible.
We haven't been able to track the family down yet.
Then we're not telling gaby,
Carlos, I have a legal responsibility here.
She has to be told.
Fine! I'll do it.
but I don't know how.
This is going to destroy her.
Nope. I was wrong. Preston,
Why are we doing this?
When renee pulls up to this house,
It's so... cozy and intimate and...
It's so... cozy and intimate and...
Pay attention, kids.
You're learning a lot of new words for "small."
I hate banging around my lonely old barn of a house.
Sometimes weeks go by without me
I'm sure you see them on whipping day.
Lynette, why so mean?
I worked on these compliments all the way from the airport.
Drive slower next time.
Mom.
It's all right. We're just old friends reconnecting.
You know, they set their own hours.
They work from their own homes.
And oh, yoy, yoy, the money.
That sounds like a dream job.
I'll bet you'd be real good at it.
Come on.
You said you had money problems.
Here's what Martha makes in a week.
Unto Martha for selling her dignity
I promise, you won't do anything
Look for yourself! She's on camera three!
What are you looking at?
Just some family photos.
Nice of your physical therapist to help with the move.
So are you gonna be okay?
Let's see. Uh, I'm getting a divorce.
I lost my business, and I'm sitting here
I've had better mondays.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
It's for the best.
We haven't been happy for a long time.
I think I need to sit quietly
Well, whatever you do..
I know it'll be spectacular.
Good-bye, Bree.
Hi, bree.
I've been thinking about our conversation last night.
I just wanted to see how you were doing.
I'm fine.
In fact, I took your advice.
I found myself a project.
I'm surprised you agreed to see me.
I wanted to spit in your face.
I didn't realize there'd be glass.
That's right. You're not used to prison.
Give yourself time.
18 months with good behavior.
You're giving me a lot of reasons
Maybe I can give you a few pointers on prison life.
I've become a bit of an expert thanks to you.
Hey, here's one.
It never hurts to tip the guard does your cavity search.
I will see you behind bars again, or dead...
Whichever is easier.
Here's another pointer.
They always record the conversations,
You murdered my sister.
That's a crazy, groundless accusation.
I have to go now.
I have things to do like shopping
What was Lynette like in college?
Uh, absolutely fearless.
She just kept wearing those parachute pants,
Yes, Renee was always the one with the fashion sense.
Before I met her,
I'd never even heard of GuCci or Prada.... .
I'd never even heard of GUCci or Prada...
Or Chlamydia.
Wow, you guys play rough.
A blouse from the "I've stopped trying" collection
And.. somebody got hunt.
That's great. easy shots. You got more money than me.
Oh, it's not about the money.
The Lynette I knew never would have settled for this.
You were adventurous.
You jumped onstage at a Springsteen concert.
It's just hard for me to reconcile
who had a threesome with two of the guys
Why would she do this?
Why would she jump in a private jet
Two guys, huh?
We're not talking about that anymore.
I mean, isn't her life perfect enough?
Does she really need to score bonus points
So was it one rugby guy and then the other,
Oh, drop it, Tom.
You know, I have shielded you
When she made that... "aw,"
She doesn't get to be disappointed in my life.
Well, maybe you should tell her how you feel.
Yeah. You're right. You're right.
In fact, I am going to tell her a lot more than that.
And I won't let anything change that.
Pork chops for dinner.
I know it was a bit of a splurge,
Something wrong?
The bank turned down my loan application.
Without that money, I can't hire any help.
And without help,
We'll never get outta here like that.
Orson, don't we have plans?
The wine tasting?
Why don't you wait for me in the van?
As you may have gleaned,
Was it evolving while you and I were still together?
No, no, of course not.
That would be a hard no.
Hold, please.
Two mothers. Only one gets the kid.
We knew they'd shoot that down.
They are shooting everything down
They have the luxury of being unreasonable right now.
We have less than 12 hours to try to settle.
Their witness lineup is better, and they know it.
We have Richard Webber.
Gamble.
We're here.
Or else they both stand their ground.
We'll see you in court.
And the kid gets torn apart.
Hi, Sofia!
Mer will be down in a second.
I'm so sorry about this.
Please. It's the best way to spend a day off.
I'm thinking pancakes for breakfast.
With chocolate chips?
Damn it. Uterus is perforated.
Let me have a look there.
Thank you.
Getting fluid in her abdomen.
This pregnancy has just become non-viable.
This baby's barely viable outside that womb.
It's only 24 weeks.
You can repair it, can't you?
I can try.
Throw in a plasma patch, hope for the best.
"Hope for the best?"
Then a patch is the way to go.
Five seconds ago, you wanted to deliver.
Now you're confident in a plasma patch?
Dr. Karev, I am the OB on call here.
If I say that a patch is best, a patch is best.
Kepner?
If it keeps the baby in,
Stay in your lane, Dr. Karev.
Prep albumin polymers, please.
I'll update the mom.
How'd it go? How's Jenny?
Well, she's still in surgery but doing great.
We located the source of the leak,
And the baby?
The baby is healthy and still in utero,
It's too little to be born, right?
It wouldn't be ideal.
I-I need you to sign one more form
It seems like I was just here
You built forts and it was really fun.
Morning! Come on in!
I don't want to.
I'm sorry. It's been a really rough morning.
She woke up really early
It is a transcript of text messages
Callie and I swap all the time.
We have very flexible schedules.
Could you please tell the court the tally at the bottom?
Dr. Webber?
She asked Dr. Torres to switch with her 34 times.
We know she was out with you at least 25 times.
And that's in addition to the previously mentioned
Now, let's just pause and think about this for a minute.
There are only 180 days in six months' time,
150 out of 180.
Calls for speculation.
Sustained.
Your Honor, we'd like to request a short recess.
So, Callie's okay slut-shaming me now?
Don't let them rattle you.
They're making it sound like a working mom is a bad mom.
I mean, we just lost in there, right?
Hey!
All you gotta do is come and get it.
It's mine and I want it.
God damn it, be careful with that!
Come on, let's go. Take me out of here.
That cost a lot of money,
Osgood?
No one's got a fuckin' name like Osgood.
God damn it!
I try to behave like a gentleman, Doris.
I really do, you know, but there's an animal side to everybody.
You think less of me, don't you? For walking out
I was the one who dragged you out of there.
I say that 'cause I think it's the truth.
I'm a licensed pilot, took karate in Tokyo.
I lectured on economics at Yale.
I can memorize the front pages
I was the National Golden Gloves champion three years in a row.
I'm fluent in four languages
Jesus!
Don't interrupt me. There's more.
Yeah.
I lie alot.
I'm staying at Caesars, Mr. Wild.
Shall we say 7:00?
7:00, Mr. Kinnick
It fuckin' worked! It really worked.
How could you be such a bastard Os, huh?
You said I was a coward and my breath was bad.
That's not an insult, that's a fuckin' insult
And you didn't tell me you were gonna take my fuckin' hair.
What was that, man?
She likes you better without it.
Heh, women, they like honesty.
Who knew? Word to the wise.
All right, fresh from the bank..
I stay with her on account of our four kids and I can survive,
What'd I miss? The special specimen.
Fuck! Shh, he's about to ask for a memory.
Okay, she's dead, but she won't lie down.
Oh, she'll lie down. She just doesn't realize
I could get a key to a $1,000 suite.
So please, Marie, leave me with the memory.
Give me something I can cherish to remember.
Okay.
Okay. Thank you. Come on.
Son of a bitch! How does he get fucked every time?
I use discs, actually.
Discs, tapes.
You've got to confront him with this. Record his reaction.
Even if he denies it, it's something.
I'm in a tricky position here. I signed a confidentiality agreement.
It's a bit late for that.
And what if I don't record any discs?
Then you'll be subpoenaed and forced to repeat this whole story.
Then I'll deny it.
Then I'll give them this.
Frank is recording every word.
Aren't you, Frank?
Oh! Come on!
Don't look so shocked. What did you expect?
That I'd come into a meeting with a man working for Lang
Except you're not working for Lang anymore.
You're working for the good guys.
You know all this is pointless, don't you?
In the end, he'll just retire over here with his CIA pension,
Good evening, sir. Hatherton welcomes you aboard.
Thank you.
It's my first time in a private jet.
Well, let's hope it's not your last.
Hi, man.
Hey, bring my ghost a Calvados.
Yes, sir.
Do you mind?
Leave it off for now.
Ruth said you were in New York to see Maddox.
I've never heard such utter balls in my entire life.
Mike would never have believed such crap. He was too clever. Too loyal.
Mike betrayed you to Rycart.
How do you know that?
He told me.
You think it was just one guy doing all that work?
Do you mind if I don't think about that?
Oh, jealous?
I'm not jealous.
I am.
But at least I know she'll be having a long day at work.
Well, at least we know brain surgery
You got to be more than 180 now.
I'd like to see you get back under 145.
Excuse me, but thinking of you men in tights makes me want to...
puke.
There's a flu going around the hospital.
Somewhat ironic.
Don't push so hard.
Can you lift your shirt? So I can examine your stomach?
Claire. you've had surgery recently.
These scars are still pink.
Don't tell my parents.
You did this in Mexico so your parents wouldn't know?
What did you have done?
And you noticed her foot twitching?
Come on, Jamie.
My foot.
Oh, yeah.
About three months ago?
Just a little.
We took her to county hospital, and she got the C.T. scan,
And the twitching has gotten worse?
A lot worse. They don't have the proper equipment back home
Hunt them down if you can't find them.
Right away.
Got the flu?
Yeah, and thanks for it.
It's making my life so much easier.
I didn't give it to you. It's all over the hospital.
You should be in bed.
Disease, diagnosis, and prescription from one man.
Seriously. I'll give you a ride home.
This is not gonna make me go home.
You go home.
But I feel fine.
Not as up close as Meredith has.
What? Are you trying to get her in trouble?
She's our friend.
George, this program will make or break our careers, okay?
Some of us will make it through, and some of us won't.
And that decision depends entirely
It's not her fault, it's Shepherd's.
He's the attending. He should know better.
He's taking advantage of her.
It didn't exactly sound like
Okay, we're in good shape here.
I think so, Dr. Shepherd.
Looks good.
Here you go, doc.
Hey, Jamie, here's what we're gonna do.
We're gonna put this on your arm, okay?
Isn't that fun?
Here, we're gonna put that onto you, like that.
And this is gonna feel cold.
This is a butterfly.
Butterfly lands right there.
Mmm, there we go. Blanket for the butterfly. Good. Nicely done.
It's amazing stuff, isn't it?
Hey, you like spaceships?
Yeah.
You do? Okay, should we take Captain O'malley,
Let's go.
It'll be safer to wait until your lunch digests
I'm just concerned.
Where did you get the idea to do this?
The Internet.
Honey, there is a healthy way to lose weight.
Yeah, I tried that, but
What are you eating?
And how much have you been working out?
Most of the time, when people hit their target weight,
Everyone gains weight in college, Mom.
It's... stressful.
l just thought if I wasn't worried about my diet, then...
I could focus more on my studies.
So you took yet another shortcut?
Life doesn't work that way, Claire.
Tina!
What? You want to argue this?
She has so much potential. If she would just apply herself
The condition has gotten radically worse
Left untreated, the disease is gonna kill her.
How soon?
Too soon.
So, is there a cure?
The treatment requires the diseased portion
See, eventually, the spinal fluid will fill the cavity.
Her age makes it possible.
Her brain's not fully developed,
But will she be normal?
There are risks to any surgery,
But if, you know, we're successful,
Look, I know this is a lot to digest.
The important thing to remember is that we can save her life.
Thank you.
Dr. O'malley?
Yes? What
But if the parents consent,
Are you in, or not?
Uh, in.
Good.
Yang.
Get out! I would kill for that.
We're gonna cut out half a girl's brain
It's outrageous.
Almost makes it hard to hate him.
Why do you hate him?
Oh, no reason.
You know about him and Meredith?
You know?
When are you gonna figure out that I know everything?
She knows.
I know.
We need to free the bowel from the adhesions caused from the abscess.
This poor girl...
What was she thinking?
She wants her mother's approval.
She wanted to please her.
And this damage is the result?
Well, getting proper nutrition will be a lifelong problem for Claire.
Great.
As if we already don't have our hands full with her.
She gets good grades.
She stays out of trouble.
She's smart.
I just think she feels like
You know, Taylor, her anesthesia's awful light.
Come on, Taylor, she's waking up.
Dr. Taylor?
Uh, he's asleep!
Taylor!
Dr. Taylor!
Oh, God, sorry. Sorry, I'm on it.
My bad, Shep.
He was right, wasn't he?
Aw, I nodded off. Come on.
Whatever you got to do to get through the day, right?
Steph, get me some coffee.
Yes, doctor.
I'll be fine. It won't happen again.
Yeah, not in here, it won't.
Uh, Steph, call Dr. Pennington.
Hopkins, take over until she gets here.
Get out of here and get it together.
What happened?
I wish them the best of luck.
Does that mean you believe he's innocent?
It means I believe in the process
Whether it's just or not
Okay thank you very much Warden.
And we will be here with you throughout the night.
Thank you.
How long until..
16 hours.
Are his lawyers making any progress?
Is there still a chance with that? No.
There's only one person who can really stop this execution.
I need to see my brother.
Just to talk.For five minutes.
Yeah. Yeah. I'll try.
OK..
I'm sorry.
I'm told that you have to wait until final visitation.
Would you talk to your father for me
Believe me my father knows where I stand on the death penalty
Sara.. Dr. Tancredi I'm sorry.
This isn't about the morality of the death penalty.
This is..
This is about killing an innocent man
Just talk to Lincoln's attorneys
Michael,
And if I'm the one asking for clemency for your brother
I'm sorry.
Yeah but a secret informant claims that Steadman is still alive?
I don't know Nick It all sounds pretty far-fetched.
You're his clerk just get US on the docket.
Nick you're asking him to commit political suicide
If he grants it he can order a stay until the tests come in.
Oh well that's better. Digging up the Vice President's brother.
No way.
Lyle Lyle look we took Intro to Civ Pro together remember?
We studied for the Bar day and night in that crappy little apartment of yours
Nick you filed an 11th-hour motion
Come on Lyle everyone knows you run that courtroom.
You can't adjust things around a bit?
The informant that was killed yesterday I was there.
I know firsthand these people will do whatever they can to frame Lincoln for Steadman's murder.
All we're asking is to be heard.
I'll give you 15 minutes this afternoon that's it.
Thank you.
He doesn't even know what happened.
He knows you tried.
He's your brother. He knows you.
So yes.
I promised I would get him out of here
Enough man all right.
You don't get a man's hopes up like that and then just...
Back Up or I'll beat your skinny ass into the ground.
And it wouldn't take much to do it.
All right ladies rec time is over. Back on the block!
You owe me a ticket out of here pretty.
And I will collect.
I'm really sorry about your brother.
Thanks.
Look I know you were counting on this so...
Let me worry about my problems.
For what it's worth over the years
Once about 10 years ago
Had to wait another three weeks while they reset the whole process.
And it may sound crazy
So take solace in the fact that your brother's wait is over.
So if something happens to the chair
There's a lot of protocol in killing a man.
A new death warrant another medical clearance.
A lot can happen in three weeks.
Yo what scrapes yo?
Thanks.
But anything or anyone that could verify your story
I know time is of the essence.
I'll reserve judgment for now. I'll take your arguments into consideration
These little bastards are the bane of my existence I swear to God.
You get this a lot?
Yeah they're attracted to the heat when they're cold
And he shorted out the wire just by biting on it?
Not by chewing on the wire alone but if the tail touches metal
I'll be damned.
So can you change the fuse?
Yeah there's another one right here in the box.
Can you do it now?
Right after I notify the state and fill out the paperwork.
It's a diaper?
Yeah.
You need to wear it.
Make me.
Good look huh? It's for the electricity.
Hair gets in the way or something.
I did everything I could.
I know you did.
Last time I had my head shaved
Remember Derek?
Bet me 40 bucks I wouldn't shave it.
I said make it $100.
Have you heard from Veronica?
She's supposed to be coming.
Is there any news on the appeal?
This isn't gonna happen.
I got to get my head straight.
Let's just share memories swap stories
I can't take it anymore.
All right.
I have to see him.
You can't go to the prison.
You'll never make it through the gate.
There will be cops everywhere.
What's that?
I had a dream last night.You and me were working on a house
And in the dream it felt like we were older.
It was so clear. The whole dream.
And when I woke I knew that today wasn't going to be the end
I know it.
I love you Dad.
They say he takes a lot of them to him.
Him him?
Him him. And today he's looking in Taranto.
What the fuck is he hoping to find with these losers?
What the fuck are you saying, Tama'? It's good fishing out here.
They're total sluts here.
They invited me to audition for Sala, as well.
We're here to see Sala. I'm her manager.
No manager. Just the girl.
All right. I'll wait out here.
Yeah, we're coming, we're coming. Who's there?
Sonia, Pat, then... ? Where are you?
At the Timone D'Oro?
All right, 20 minutes.
Sergio needs to finish something for work first.
Unfortunately, you're lacking two things, class and his acquaintance.
Two details that will soon be resolved, Fabrizio!
You're throwing away your savings, Sergio.
And you'll go back to Taranto dirt poor.
Well, in that case, have some, relax.
It's so old-fashioned! I haven't touched coke for a good ten years.
So don't get in the way. The girls love this old-fashioned stuff.
No, I understand.
What did you hear?
Nothing. You weren't talking.
Bravo...
...Sergio Morra.
You know me?
You do everything you can to get yourself noticed.
So I've studied you a bit, from a distance.
Well, I like to keep busy.
In all these years, he has given us two things
But they're not enough anymore.
What are you saying, Santino?
Darling, could you look after the boy a moment?
We're talking seriously here.
Luigino, why don't you drive around over there?
And why don't you fuck off?
I'm saying that we lost
Explain this a bit more.
You may control six national TV networks,
All those broken promises..
People notice.
His collaborator sentenced to nine years for ties to the Mafia.
People get pissed off.
He goes abroad and says,
Does it seems smart to you to go on TV and say,
Isn't that true?
Of course it's true. You can think it, but you don't say it.
He's 70 years old, Cupa.
His heart and prostate are wrecked, though he keeps using them,
I know where you're headed,
I'm not going to piss on my career by promoting an arrogant cocaine addict.
Fuck you, Santino.
Get the fuck off me, now. I will not cheat on my man.
What the fuck?
What are you, 13?
I've never cheated on Sergio.
You just have, dear!
You're a piece of shit!
And now people are going to piss on you.
Because I'll tell them everything, Santino,
Where are you going... .?
Do you have any wishes, Sergio?
Some of my wishes have already come true.
Yes...
Yes, I know, I know.
I mean, they're totally incompetent!
Where the hell are they going to go with that pathetic majority?
I think you just need to be patient, you'll be back in power soon.
Are you bored, love?
Just because your arm is hurting, you think it's going to fall off!
Shall we do something after the Bagaglino Show, darling?
Oh, that's a shame, you have to go back.
Yeah, Geri was delighted.
Don't speak about him like that, love.
This cost me 300 euros and it looks like shit.
Most powerful man in Italy, time is money.
If only all you needed was a top to make the difference, love!
Did you check me out properly, love?
Let's hope this shit doesn't go on too long. Oh, God, here we go!
This isn't politics, this is pussy.
How did you know, Silvio?
I don't know anything, I understand.
An indefatigable lover of my calibre
Well, that's precisely what I want to talk to you about.
On one condition.. that you don't omit her name.
Otherwise I'll spend all my time trying to figure out who she is,
Tamara Morra. Do you know her?
By sight.
A good-looking woman.
She's two-faced, Silvio.
She urged me to stand as your successor
Listen carefully, Santino.
Whoever is not with me is against me.
They'll be kicked out the party and beheaded politically.
What is a salesman, Silvio?
Two things. The salesman is a lonely man.
But we're not interested in that because it would only depress us.
So put that aside, but don't forget it,
We're interested in the other thing.
Who is this?
Augusto Pallotta, head of sales at Pallotta Real Estate Ltd.
And does this seem to you the time to call people to sell an apartment?
Yes, ma'am,
Listen, I don't have time to waste.
Neither do I, ma'am. If I'm calling you now,
I don't need an apartment.
Yes, ma'am, everyone dreams of owning a home.
The self-serving laws you had passed to further your economic interests
Not because the wealthiest man in Italy,
And not because your politics are nothing more than populist propaganda
So if all these inferences of yours are not the reason,
Because I wanted to switch sides. That's exactly the point!
The problem is that, while I waited for you, I remembered something.
What?
What the writer Javier Marias said about you.
Oh, God, another one! What did this one have to say?
He said that when you attend international summits,
This is the reason I cannot side with you.
Silvio, you hear how good she is?
I studied whistling technique in Dubai.
And she's not just good, she's beautiful.
And I brought her here because she's dying to meet you.
Bravo, Fabrizio, but now you can take her back. You go as well, Fabrizio.
Dear Veronica,
Come, dear.
I have a favourite writer as well.
Dino Buzzati.
They're all on holiday, who knows where?
I don't give a shit. Round them up. You're drowning in debt, Fabrizio.
Bring him the girls and I'll convince him to help you.
You'll help me?
You'll end up being treated like shit.
They want you, not him.
I can understand that.
There's another thing, delicate and annoying.
It seems that a sort of handbook has been drawn up,
No kisses, no hugs, no pats on the back,
I do as I please.
My electors like the way I behave with other heads of state.
At least your jokes, Silvio. Could you at least avoid telling jokes?
What do they have against jokes?
What about Churchill, then?
He was famous for his jokes.
He's a crazy, sick man. That's what he is.
Was that less melodramatic?
Remember what Borboni said when she saw you in the theatre?
"You were good, dear, just a shame I couldn't hear anything!"
Not only were you no actress, but you were a bimbo, too,
Fine, but remember that this bimbo
Look what you became!
Maybe that's why I felt the need for companionship.
I built a financial and political empire.
Fine, Silvio, fine.
You've spent a lifetime telling us and yourself how brilliant you are!
We've had enough of it. And you want to know something else?
It's not true.
It's not true you're as skilful as you say you are.
Your skill as a businessman consists in having cheated your whole life.
You are so naive!
What do you think every other businessman,
Do you think they're all blessed with righteousness except for me?
Let me tell you a truth
They're all like me.
They're all prepared either to go around obstacles or knock them down.
But I did it better than the rest of them, because I am the best.
You're just a child who's afraid of dying.
But I have a duty to be completely honest with you.
You're not good.
Come back soon.
If I come back later, it's because I won.
Then you'll be back soon.
Why won't they let me govern?
Why won't they let me run this country the way I did my companies?
Instead the leftist judges torment me with trials,
I don't understand it.
What did you expect?
That you could be the richest man in the country,
Yes, that's exactly what I expected.
Well, you never got off that cruise ship where we played as kids.
Or maybe I never got on it.
You know something?
A few days ago, in some magazine,
And I noticed...
they all look like Veronica.
Why don't you try again, Silvio?
One day there was a girl here.
Stella she was called.
I approached her and she said to me..
Just be yourself. No, I'm going to be exactly what they want me to be.
"Anchor."
A reliable or principal support,
I believe I can do that for your viewers
Tell us more about yourself
I studied journalism at the University of Texas.
Of course.
Good answer.
My role models include my parents, which I know is corny,
and, um, I am recently engaged.
We like that. We'll have a decision in two weeks
Skeletons?
Bones of any kind?
I'm a good girl.
Morning, Meghan Miles.
Be well. Good day. Good day.
Hey, looking good, Chuck Rogers.
Five minutes to air, people.
I just spoke to my source inside the network. And?
Its down to you and Wendy Chang.
The decision should come down today.
Madeline, where are you go.. You're in the middle for this!
Madeline.
Are you done, or should... ?
Is she done, or... .?
Hello!
CK is one block south.
Just go one at a time. Do you want to go next?
You really shouldn't use hand sanitizer like that. It dries out your skin.
Oh, what sweater should I wear?
The one with floral or the one with floral?
The mood swings.
They can be so bad sometimes.
High, low. You never know where you're gonna go.
Throwing things, hitting me.
But I love you no matter what
Were you smoking?
I can smell it on you! Go take a shower, for Christ's sakes.
Do you want some pancakes?
Pancakes!
I know you hate butter.
Yes. Will you eat anything?
Anything?
See, Damon eats.
Damon fucking eats. And he keeps it in.
You're not going to rehearsal on Friday
When you were a.. just a little baby,
I've never heard you say that without a crossbow in your hand.
I can't wait till we get that money.
Think of all the stuff we could buy.
American toothpaste.
Some toilet paper so we can stop using our bath mat.
Caroline, you hold on to this
Why are you giving it to her?
I mean, you really think she can keep a secret
Well, you don't want me to have it.
If I know, I'll spoil it.
I have no poker face.
Neither did my mom, which is how I became
Caroline, I'm warning you.
Don't let it slip.
Even if I beg you, don't tell me.
Okay.
That's why I didn't want to give it to her.
Your dad wrote and directed this thing too?
Dang, he's like the Ben Affleck of jail.
Yikes, it says here
Oh, my God. That's terrible.
We're seeing an understudy?
Oh, look! My dad's opening the show.
Steel bars
Steel bars on our balls
Well, we won't keep you prisoner much longer.
So we're just gonna take a brief intermission,
Second half? That was three hours!
That was incredible, Dad!
Especially the escape attempt scene.
"Shanks for Nothing"?
He sure is a big man on his blog,
Well, I would have gone with "It's A Prison Riot."
All right, well, here you go.
Here's your envelope,
I'm real sorry to hear about you and Max.
Unless maybe it's a good thing
Why does every single person keep telling me
all right, it's just Max and you.
Here. Let me do that.
Listen, honey.
You only have to work on Wall Street, okay?
You can live on the Upper East Side
Daddy, did you and Max talk about this?
Kitten, I know you better than anybody,
You could still be friends with Max.
She like tennis?
How do you know where I belong?
What we do is fucking hard, alright?
Now can I watch this fucking in peace
Fuck.
Yeah, go on. Pick one.
That one?
Okay!
Pay day, love?
Here, how much you charging anyway?
What did you just say?
Mummy's gonna show you how to eat spaghetti.
Spoon. Fork.
No, Lucy, not with your fingers!
Mummy!
So I said to myself, "Who are my two best men?"
I had just made dinner
Believe me, I'm a mother too.
After dinner at our house,
There was evidence of
I had wine with dinner.
How much, would you say?
I know these questions may seem intrusive, Mrs. Collins,
I am aware that your husband died.
He was murdered.
I'm very sorry.
It must be difficult for you.
My husband being murdered?
Yes, quite difficult.
I mean coping.
What, with the fact that the police
And the trunks begin to slip and slide.
When Nursey falls on to the floor in a...
Heap.
And mummy tells you to let her..
Sleep!
You want to talk about endless patience?
Penny made me watch all five seasons
There are six seasons, dude.
Oh, crap!
No, no, no, the sixth season is great.
We go to Paris with Carrie and get our heart broken,
It's a wild ride.
Door.
CJ, where are you going?
We're supposed to play here.
What's happening in Chicago?
Tell me everything. Go away.
Are you guys going out?
I barely made it to the age of eleven, before
Are you pissing, right now?
Look at him, he is pissing
No pissing in the schoolyard!
Even the teacher started doing it.
Yeah, Mamai he does that
Well, my friend, I know an Indian
It must be fate that the two of you should meet."
So what has Mamaji already told you?
He said you had a story that would make me believe in God.
He would say that about a nice meal.
As for God, I can only tell you my story.
You'll decide for yourself what you believe.
Fair enough.
Let's see then. Where to begin?
Pondicherry
Spectacle.
Don't let the stories and pretty lies fool you, boys.
Religion is darkness.
My dear Apa believed himself part of the new India.
As a childs he'd had polio.
He used to lie in bed wracked with pain,
In the end, God didn't save him.
My Amma went to college
religion was the only Tink she had to her past.
ur religion was the:only ink She had to her past.
ur religion was the only link she h
It was a third there, Ravi and I were terribly bored.
Challenge. I give you two rupees.
Run into that church, and drink the holy water.
You must be thirsty
Why would a God do that?
Why would he send his own son
D ealulSe e O es S
But we can understand God's son,
If God is so perfect, and we are not
I came to faith through Hinduism,
But God wasn't finished with me yet.
God works in mysterious ways.
And so it was he introduced him to me again,
My Arabic was never very good.
But the sound and feel of the words brought me closer to God.
In performing "Salah", the ground I touched became holly ground,
Are you out of your mind?
Who gave you the permission to come back here?
You just ignored everything I've ever taught you?
I-I just wanted to say Hello to him.
You think that tiger is your friend.
He's an animal, not a playmate!
That tiger... is not your friend.
When you look into his eyes,
Nothing else.
You stupid. Say "I'm sorry."
You know what your father said about coming back here?
I am sorry.
I was
This is between a father and his sons.
He said he's sorry. You'll just scare them for life.
Scare them? That boy almost lost his arm.
But he's just a boy.
He will be a man sooner than you think.
And this is a lesson I do not want them ever to forget!
We are doing this for you and Ravi.
Come inside and have some diner.
Vegetarian, please.
Oh, my sons and I are vegetarians.
Do you have anything... No no no no no!
Not for gravy.
You don't want gravy?
Hello.
I am happy Buddist.
So I eat rice next to gravy.
I'm sure, gravy is not meat.
It's taste. You try?
Don't worry.
We will have plenty of fresh supplies after we stop in Manila.
Why give Orange Juice tranquilizers?
He's not gonna cause any trouble.
The stress of traveling is not good for the animals,
We don't want to be cleaning up,
DO we
Hey. Get rid of me!
It's my bed.
It was a human tooth.
Don't you see the island was carnivorous?
Carnivorous? Like a Venus Ely trap?
Yes. The whole island.
The plants, the water and those pools, the very ground itself
But at night, some chemical process
I filled my stores with fresh water,
I couldn' leave without him, of course
And so I waited for his return.
I knew he wouldn't be ate
No one has seen that floating island since.
And you won't read about those trees in any nature book.
And yet, if I hadn't found those shores, I would have died.
And if I hadn't discovered that tooth,
Even when God seemed to have abandoned me, he was watching.
Even when he seemed indifferent to my suffering, he was watching.
And when I was beyond all hope of saving,
And gave me a sign to continue my journey.
By the time we reached the Mexican shore,
My strength was gone, I was so weak.
I was afraid that in two feet of water
I struggled to shore, and feI upon the sand.
It was warm and soit,
And somewhere, two eyes were smiling, that having me there.
II was so spent, I could hardly move.
The cook threw me a life buoy and pull me aboard,
The cook... was a disgusting man.
Ee ate a rat!
We had food enough for weeks,
Just a brute bad man.
But he was resourceful
It was a week later that he
"Nipola!"
here wasn't anything I could do.
Couldn't look away...
Couldn't look away
He threw her body overboard,
Next day, I killed him.
e didn I even fight back, he knew he'd gone too far
Jesus, Dave! your mom's making vegan crap for dinner. I wanted meat!
I'm not making anything else!
The die never lie.
I'd play your Dragons or whatever if you asked me to.
That would be hilarious.
You're serious?
y not? You make it sound like..
I don't know, I'm just saying that I'd play if you asked.
When, exactly?
Can you hang on a second.
It's a shower night tonight, so lights out at 9:30.
it wouldn't kill you to wash a dish either.
Hey. Nothing really. It's just the usual.
My brother is a snarling ball of anger and my sister is..
herself.
Good times.
"Dishes."
She just wants to play with you.
Embarrassing me in front of my friends?
Dave, u're on that thing all the time.
Barbara is reaching out, and that's good.
No, it's weird and stupid!
Why do you care... loud or she'll hear us talking.
Okay.
So Ur is twenty miles tall,
He's the only one.
s so lonely that in his anguish,
Giving birth
the first dark kings of the Earth.
At least that's what they liked to think.
Giants are vermin,
But huge, of course.
They can hit thirty feet and come in all flavors.
Giants have hair of living ice,
Swamp Giants will clear out a whole village of people,
Mountain Giants bathe in the blood of children,
hese creeps, they're Harbingers.
They just like to watch. Totally sketchy.
you see a Harbinger, a Giant is around.
Even worse, though, Titans.
These are the big guys.
Like Greek myth stuff.
Hold on. You need to see what we're dealing with.
Giants aren't real.
Then why are you sweating?
There you have it.
Can't compete with a baby deer.
Once they find food they don't go for the bait.
We're going to have to track it.
I want to see if it took a bite out of this guy, though.
The Giant Killer.
See, you never give up, Barbara.
h I could have seen those games.
But then you'd be old.
anny said I could use the table.
Why weren't you at school?
Has something to do with a charter I did in Seattle.
What I do know is their end game
And once that happens,
But I don't want to involve you in this mess.
That's way too dangerous.
I'm not asking your permission, James.
I can do this on my own,
I don't understand everything that's going on,
Let's see what we can discover about them.
Find out what their plan is, see what they're all about.
They're trying to get you out, and you don't trust them?
I don't trust any of these guys.
Be wise and take advantage.
Now, can you fix the electricity
It's not that simple.
The water pipes are inside the prison.
The electrical lines are probably running underground
Hey, Linc.
Look, bro, um, I'm going to be out of your way real soon.
I saw these flyers for migrant workers in Colombia.
It's coffee bean season,
Bus leaves today, okay?
All right, well, before you get out of here, man, I
Linc, uh I appreciate everything you've done
Just a couple hours, that's it.
When I was 15, my cousin told me about a job that only lasts
I'm in Panama, I don't speak the language
I'm going ake money and send it home.
Underground or not, I'm going to be a dad, Linc,
I spoke to James.
He confirmed what you told me
You and I, we both have people in there
Please let me help you.
Your Spanish as good as your English?
Yes, Colonel.
I just have one favor to ask.
It's just outside of the gate.
You, you can bring your men.
Thank you for arranging this for US, Colonel.
I'm getting something out of this as well,
You know you can fix this electric problem?
I won't know for sure until we can start digging,
My men will shoot you in I back of the head
And you, patron, if anything goes wrong.
it will not only be his life that is lost.
You have my word on that.
No worries, Colonel.
I'll keep this boy in line.
I'll dig.
I don't need your help.
Hey, come on, now, don't be proud.
I heard you talking just yesterday.
Talking to Mahone.
You know, about how US Americans should stick together.
help me down the road, right, Mikey?
What is it, a "66 or a '67?
I'm gave him the shovels. Get him out.
I gave him shovels too, and guys to work with, just like you.
I worked in the prison he broke out of.
He said he was doing me a favor
And you know what I got?
Hog-tied and left in a pipe under my own prison.
There's nothing he can do.
The soldiers are watching him.
That's what I thought,
He's buried something in a junction box out there
Go see for yourself.
Trouble keeps finding you here in Sona, doesn't it?
Let's take a walk, eh?
There are rumors about that you are trying to trick me.
I'm just doing what I'm told.
Oh? Let's hope for your sake that's true.
Hmm?
But justmake sure.
Relax. I'll get you the money.
And I will meet you there. Okay.
How are you holding up?
I just want to get this done.
Good.
Stay here.
I'm coming with you. Stay here.
Yeah, I know; that's the problem.
But you will still just run off and do whatever you want?
What kind of a man are you that just
Lechero wants to talk to you.
I was just about to get a little trim.
You're a real smart guy.
What the hell are you doing in prison?
Here.
It's perfect.
How did you get it?
It's what you wanted, right?
Yeah.
Good work.
So what's the next step?
Uh we wait.
And I'll keep you posted.
You know what you need to do.
What do you think?
When i fix electricity for reason,
Unless you want to make the colonel happy.
Actually, it's in both of our best
Now all we have
Thank you.
Hey, brother. Want a cold one?
I got a long-term deal here, kind of come and go as I please.
I seen a lot of crazy shit but never a murder.
One of the kids finally said something to the owner.
I guess he did it to her earlier in the day.
Where'd you do your time, bro?
Them girls your nieces?
Yeah. Yeah, we're on vacation.
I was.. I was wondering if you're looking for work at all
Yeah, what you got, kid?
Got like $20,000, man.
There's a guy runs a clinic on Broadway.
Place is a drug jug. I know the cleaning lady.
What? You take down doctors?
I am a thief, and I'm a real, real good one.
This guy has a sampler pharmacy on the premises.
What do you need me for?
I need somebody to front a van, help me move it.
I got all the clients, but, you know,
Someone like you at the table when the deal goes down,
You seem like a good kid, but you got the wrong idea.
We're just down for some sun and waves.
You could take care of them girls a lot better
You don't need 10 grand, man?
Not where I'm going.
Thanks for the beer.
Who is this?
You know who this is, you son of a bitch.
You took pictures of my lungs.
Yes. I remember, Mr. Cade.
How long do I have?
I can't say. I just
You need to come back in.
We need. Roy, you didn't We need to do a biopsy.
You just left, and we..
You want to forget magic?
Then why did you keep the ring?
I was going to sell that on eBay.
You're still a bad liar, Dave. I like that about you. It's a good sign.
You have the gift.
No, I have a life.
You're the last person Horvath saw with the Grimhold.
That puts you on his list.
So unless you want him to turn you into a pig who just loves physics,
This is crazy. You see how crazy this is, right?
All right. All right.
You help me get it back, you're done.
Really?
You can walk away.
Can you please put my dresser back?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
What are you..Oh, no.
Please don't do that. What are you doing?
What?
Whoa. What is that?
Here we go. All right. Move.
Sorry about that. It's just nice for them to see a genuine icon like me.
Fortunately, they'll all be dead soon.
And before that, we need to find the boy.
Well, how do we do that?
We'll wait until he's alone.
Now, focus on control. Set me down slow and steady.
Dave? It's Becky.
I'll be back shortly.
Could you please hide? Hide now. Please.
Dave, get back here.
We have important work to do.
Where is she?
She?
He hasn't told you, has he?
The truth about who's inside the doll?
Sweetheart, you've put your faith in the wrong man.
Tell me, have you ever been in love?
You're in love right now. I can see it in your eyes.
No, no, no, no. Don't deny it.
I wonder what would happen
Shut up.
You'd be no better than the rest of us.
this polluted, dirty piece of earth?
I imagine I want it for the same reason you did.
I'm in the garment business, so I take that as a testament.
But I inherited this property from my uncle.
Sadly, he had no children of his own.
He was the one that let them put these tanks up here.
So, you see, this place....  can do nothing for me.
I offered to lease this site to you for a very fair price
Why is that?
I like to own the things I use.
I can see that
You gonna check on the new house?
Yeah, I'll see you back home.
Do you need anything else?
Okay.
I'll be here to pick you up when you get out.
Thank you.
These men are cowards.
They're too weak to make a living or even fight with their own hands.
And too stupid to think of anything else to do.
So, you guys have done what you needed to?
I'm sorry?
Well, you just said you've done what you needed to do.
So, what is it that you've done?
I'm not exactly sure, you know. I just got here at 4:00.
My shift's actually up, So..
Right.
So, you've done nothing?
Hey, why'd they want it?
They wanted the $6,000 worth of fuel that was in it.
Trucks 14 through 23 are on the road.
Thirty to 33 are just about ready to go.
Nick, the gasket's good. You should get over there and get going
to try to help our business and the city.
But also know that I have never taken anything from anyone.
So when you say that we've...
We're on the same side here.
Well, yes and no.
And because of that, I don't really feel comfortable sitting here..
pretending like the elephant perched on the corner of my desk isn't there.
So, you know, I can't go into specifies right now...
but we believe that you and your company have broken the law
So next week we will be bringing a case against you.
It's a little awkward, obviously...
but, I didn't want to have this happen next week
You know, out of respect.
You have your job to do.
But know that you're wrong.
And we will take advantage of every opportunity to prove that.
Abel!
Exactly.
Caused by the drift of soft silt from the sides of the
Sure.
What is that?
It's a gun.
It's a fucking gun.
Where did you get that?
Your youngest daughter found it in the bushes outside our front door.
She was playing with it.
Look. It's loaded. With the safety off
It was a fucking goon with a loaded gun looking in our window.
We've just pushed it a little too far, that's all.
Let's look at it like a badge of honor.
We're big enough now they even give a shit about us.
You need to go home right away...
and start going through our set of books.
How far back are they going
I'll get into it.
One other thing. The bank.
I need you two to sit down with them. I set up a dinner.
I want you both there. Just be up front. Be honest.
I don't anticipate a problem.
God knows they've given money to bigger crooks than us.
Jesus. All right.
that these are dangerous times and we have to adapt.
It's not like when we was driving
Not well.
He feels very strongly about it.
T can see that.
I don't think he fully understands.
What is there to understand
Well, first of all, it's illegal.
It's not illegal if I say it isn't.
My responsibility is to provide..
safe and timely passage of goods and products
We need to Close this deal.
We cannot stay like this any longer.
We have to close on that property.
We're so weak right now.
Why do you want this so badly?
Because I've got my entire savings at risk on this deposit.
No, no, no, no. I don't mean the deposit.
I mean.. this. Why do you want it?
Have you ever thought about it?
Yes, I've thought about it. I've thought about it every day for the last five years.
That place has just been sitting right across that fence mocking me.
I'm not talking about that place.
I-I-I just meant everything
I have no idea what you mean.
What'll we play?
Here you go.
As you can see, I'm in the middle of my daughter's birthday party.
I understand and I apologize. I do.
But this is a warrant, and we need to gain complete access to the property
Let me check something.
Js he serious?
I'm gonna fucking kill this guy.
They got a birthday party going on.
Abel. He's saying it's a bad time.
Maria. Keep the kids playing
Anna Morales.
May I speak with you for a minute?
I understand you and your men have a job to do here.
but we're in the middle of a 10-year-old's birthday party.
This is probably one you're gonna regret.
Excuse me?
My husband's an honorable man.
We're not who you think we are.
I think I know your father.
Good for you.
My husband is not my father.
Not even close.
So if I were you...
I would start treating us with a little more respect.
or I guarantee..
he will make it his mission in life to ruin you.
This was very disrespectful.
And you're not gonna find a fucking thing.
Trucks 14 through 23 are on the road
Six, what are you doing back here?
Hey. How are you?
Look, there's a door down here about four more flights.
You come out under the bridge. It's a park.
Fuck you!
You're welcome.
Where's the truck now?
It's still up on the bridge
Kathy, it's me. What are you talking about? What shots?
It's 16. Someone shot up his truck on the 59th Street Bridge.
Do you know how long it took me to pay you off?
Seven months. Six and a half
I put 40% down deposit on this property
because you said that you would be there.
You now have three serious separate pending legal cases against you..
one with 16 counts of misconduct.
ranging from fraud to tax evasion.
And then today, in the middle of our meeting
which led to a shoot out on the 59th Street Bridge.
So, I should start by thanking you...
for your assistance in attempting to bring in the driver.
Yeah, we didn't expect him to react that way.
Yeah, well, the officers there didn't set it up very well on their end either.
I'm sorry.
Miss Lange.
It has been brought to our attention..
that it might be beneficial on your end
It's a possibility.
So we have prepared an offer for you to review.
I'll present it to him.
It's good, Andrew
need more time.
Of course you do.
I know our agreement doesn't allow for that.
But I need more time.
and I should say that we feel fairly certain...
after a very frank conversation..
that the guys who are doing this
As you know, there are plenty of other smaller providers in the area..
that might have something to do with it who are not here tonight, so.
Peter, thank you.
Thank you. That may be true.
But I don't think it's as bad as they're saying it is.
I guess I kind of knew what I was doing
Got us three more days.
That's great.
And I got a piece from Saul.
When I was putting them to bed tonight..
I told them that their dad was out there
I said that whatever he wanted
and that there was no man
This is all worth it.
Of course.
Hey.
I didn't know you were coming
You've grown.
You saw me a month ago.
I know. I know. But you have.
Tesus.
I don't know how you get any work done around here.
That's how much has been taken from me over the last six months
Your Far Rockaway facility bought a load of fuel.
off of one of my stolen trucks last week.
That's not possible.
Arnold
just thinking about the cowards that have done this..
Now, as you know, Texas number four is marked.
Do you have any receipts over the last year...
for incoming marked number four?
So I'm guessing there's at least, what
I said.... . 213,000.
I said. 213,000.
I need a day.
Okay.
But I was just buying the stuff off these guys.
I... I-I only bought a couple loads.
I don't know who they are. I would never do that.
This may ruin me.
My goal was to have you out of business by the end of next year.
But if you're this fucking desperate
Abel. I wasn't the only person buying this shit.
All right, well, when you find out who else did it
But I need the whole lot by tomorrow morning..
or you're gonna have the feds at your doorstep by noon.
There he is.
I don't want you to be in this position.
We are not nice people to borrow three quarters of a million dollars from.
T know that.
You know, I'm... I'm gonna think about this.
You know, we should both think about this.
Oh, got this at the Goodwill store for 50 cents.
Can you believe it?
50 cents sounds right.
Let's go.
You know, it's kinda late.
Why don't we just spend the night here?
Because we don't live here.
I know.
Do you? You said when you got back from space
That's not true.
Howard, I'm doing laundry!
You want me to put anything in for you?!
There's some underwear in the hamper!
Oh, good! I got that new stain stick to try out!
Thank you! I only put it on the list two weeks ago!
Okay, I see what you're getting at:
Thank you.
That place really did remind me of my hometown.
Because there we also have a HomeTown Buffet.
Hold on. Wil and Amy had an argument?
Yes, quite the kerfuffle.
Then Amy got mad and left?
Walked right out the door.
And you.... ?
Enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price.
The manager recognized Wil
Right next to it!
Buddy, I think Amy might be upset.
Why's that?
Because your friend was rude to her,
You're just repeating what I said.
It's like living with a lactose-intolerant parrot.
Trust me, call her.
Fine. It's a shame you didn't go to dinner with US,
I was this close.
What?
You'll appreciate this.
Leonard has some ridiculous notion that you're mad at me.
Tell him you're not mad at me.
Go ahead, set him straight.
The new Enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage
Enter Wesley Crusher, played by my buddy...
An end of an era.
Boy, if these walls could talk.
They'd say, "Why does he touch himself so much?"
I can't believe I'm not going to live here anymore.
This has always been my bedroom.
Right here is where my mom used to mark my height.
Sixth grade.
Seventh grade.
Eighth grade.
Ninth grade.
I remember when I was five,
Came home, celebrated with a Snickers,
When did you figure out you were allergic to nuts?
Sometime around the third Almond Joy.
Okay.
You want to start loading this stuff into the truck?
Yeah, I guess.
Hey, would you do me a favor?
Go on ahead.
I just want one last moment alone in my old room.
We're not standing outside by the U-Haul
Fine, let's go.
What brings you in?
Penny, if you wouldn't mind,
Are you finally getting fuzz in weird places?
Penny, please,
Will that calm my nerves?
It's calmed the pants off me a couple of times.
Sold.
So, the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble?
The trouble isn't with me, Penny,
Someday, scientists will discover
Yeah, Amy told me what happened.
Look, just apologize.
It's a band-aid at best.
The core problem is that Amy and Wil do not like each other.
Which is baffling because they're both crazy about me.
And I like them,
Honey, you can't make people like each other.
Not true.
Leonard made me like you.
And let me tell you, that was a hard row to hoe.
Cheers, pal.
Boy, that is a treat that's hard to beat.
Get the Mad Hatter on the horn, I'm having a tea party.
You might want to pace yourself.
I drink tea all the time.
I think I know what I'm doing.
I thought your dad paid your cards.
I have a card for emergencies that I pay for myself.
What emergency happened at the L.A. Zoo?
That's a penguin I sponsor.
They're losing their homes to global warming,
What is Pink Cheeks?
It's intimate waxing. Quit looking at that!
Maybe you should find someone
Like a business manager?
No, absolutely not.
You can't afford to hire someone
That is a foolish expense, and I forbid it.
What if there's someone who just likes controlling
We don't know, his mother never had him tested.
You're talking about me. Very funny.
Although I would enjoy drawing up a budget
Wait, wait, who's gonna break it to the penguin?
Okay, Sheldon.
Yeah, I'm putting you in charge of my finances.
I will not spend another penny that you don't authorize.
Very well.
Hey, Comic-Con tickets go on sale this Friday.
You can't buy one.
Oh, better luck next time, Pink Cheeks.
When there's hair growing out of it, that's a mole."
I should hope so.
When she called me an insensitive jerk,
There's got to be other ways you can make a quick buck.
Yeah, you'd think.
Ooh, maybe I could sell my blood and sperm.
I really should wear a bell around my neck
Here, let me help you.
Thank you.
What's up, my man? You look pretty down.
My mother in korea is working
Well, uh, I didn't expect a back and forth here.
Uh, Max, do you wanna move in?
Han, you can't let your mommy keep bullying you.
Stand up to her. You're a 53-year-old man.
Max, I am 29.
What?
I am 29.
What do you got, a case of the Benjamin Buttons?
Caroline, Han says he's 29.
What?
Han, are you sure?
Yes, what makes you think I'm older?
Oh, wow, look at that.
That car just exploded in front of those two girls,
Are you ever gonna let this go?
I don't know. I mean, it's kind of a big deal.
You put my life in danger.
Well, I've apologized about it twice.
I don't know how much more I can do.
Yeah, I could have died,
I don't like this movie.
It's violence against women.
Let's go see that katherine Heigl rom-com sequel.
Talk about violence against women.
I am gonna go spend some time with Katie Heigl.
At least she won't make me feel guilty.
See ya.
How will I live with the shame?
Well, at least your fanny pack
Well, well, well, look who it is.
Hair flip and go.
I don't know what you're doing, but it feels weird.
Now, look who's walk, walk, walking with purpose
What? It wasn't a big deal.
Really? 'cause I went to movie jail with Han.
Cool.
We have a mug shot.
We're a notorious gangster couple now down at the Cineplex.
That's right, Han-nie and Clyde,
I'm thrilled, actually,
An unobstructed view of my sweet, sweet ass?
No, the satisfaction of knowing
What a selfish thing to say.
Full disclosure.
I was pretty bummed to be paired with a freshman.
Then I thought, hello, bright side..
I'm going to be your spirit guide.
We can get you into all the best places even without a fake.
No problem.
Mom?
I like your sweater.
Thanks, I got it from the Gap.
It means a lot to me that you could be here.
Congratulations.
Thanks for coming.
I'm happy you decided to join us, son.
Landon tells us you're in Professor Soto's seminar.
Yeah.
So, you're an English major?
Um, I would love to, but I think if I want to be employed
If you're interested in the business side of literature
I don't know how they work.
Very easy. Point and shoot.
Got extra blankets in the back.
No, I'm fine. This will be comfortable.
Okay, suit yourself.
I'm setting the alarm for 5:00 a.m., okay?
That way, we'll be in Texas by lunch.
I have $20 set aside for breakfast,
Do you have, like, a PowerPoint presentation?
I'm a little bit more of a visual learner.
You know what? Actually, I do.
Let me just pull it up really quick.
Where are the blankets?
In the back.
Dude, mind your business.
Whoa, whoa, easy.
I'm just trying to be welcoming.
I'm Jarrod. So where you headed?
Albuquerque.
Can I come?
Table for two, please?
Anywhere you want. This isn't Applebee's.
Just some unsolicited advice...
If you're gonna shoot your shot,
What can I get you girls?
Can I get the spaghetti and meatballs please?
May I please have the burger, but instead of fries,
We don't really have a side salad.
It's just gonna be more of the same lettuce.
Okay, just the burger then is fine.
Actually, can I get some fries please?
Thank you.
Yeah, thanks for saving us back there.
That was nice.
Actually, uh, maybe you could...
Could you drive us to the closest bus station?
Ah, we already running kind of late
I mean, closest stop is probably Amarillo.
Doesn't Matthews live in Amarillo?
That's true. Hop on in.
We'll take you as far as the fairgrounds,
Um, I don't know if we have time for that.
Well, either way,
Let's do this!
All right, come on, let's go!
Here we go!

Looks like 23's losing control!
Oh, why?
Into the wall. 23 is out for the count.

There go your ride right there.
What? No, can't walk to New Mexico. What?
Yeah, we're trying to get to the bus station in Amarillo,
I generally try not to associate with fugitives,
Oh, thank you, wow.
Right on... I gotta go drive a monster truck

you're spending a lot of time on that one cupcake.
is it for someone special?
no, it's for nobody.
hey, i've been, uh, i've been meaning to ask.

it's for julie.
for the rest of her life?
when she was a kid,
we are gonna do all the things she loved to do when she was a kid.
oh, hey. do we still have that trampoline in the garage?
she would jump on that thing for hours.
i would be up in my room, reading,
"hi, mom. hi, mom. hi, mom."
hi. hey, mike.
hey, kiddo. you look great.
I'm not in a place to do this right now.
No, no, no. Slow down.

Hugs and kisses.
Hugs and kisses? O, he does like me.
I'm going to call him.
Bill?
Um.. what else didn't she tell US?
I don't know.
Did she tell you she can hold her hand Over an open flame without crying?
Yeah, her eyes water,
But it's not all her fault.
I should've stopped drinking when i was pregnant,
I'm back. Who's ready for dessert:
Still not talking to me, huh?
I'm channeling my anger into cleaning.
Well, i was going to apologize,
You do realize that scaring those people off Doesn't change anything.

You can't imagine how many people want this baby.

You're gonna find love.

Well, some people at school think that's inappropriate To do on the playground.
Oh. Well,
No, no, no, no kissing ryan anywhere.
But that's how it works.
First, kissing, then get married, Then he buys me presents.
Oh, my god. You are my daughter.
Honey...
What do we do now
All right, guys. No more junior varsity bullshit.
We gotta lead with a pro-style offense.
Something Billy won't see coming
I was thinking the best opportunity for an ambush
How are we going to do that?
I think I have an idea
Vicki, are you crying?
You're not. It's okay.
If it makes you feel better,
Wow. That's evil
Hey, Max, if I'm going to die tonight,
And just cut me out of your life.
And I missed you. I missed our friendship.
And then you two became best friends
And so, I did some really bad things
Vicki. No, no, no, Just let me finish, okay.
No, no, no. I got this. I got this.
Tina.
Are you sure you can..
Look, man, I got this, all right?
I got this! I so got this.
Just say the words. What words?
Billy Murphy was a kid who went to camp here years ago.
Tell me the story again! Hurry!
He was always picked on for being different, ugly.
Keep going. Don't stop!
And then one summer, the hottest one on record,
Where the hel are we?
Just skip to the end!
Legend has it Billy still lives in these woods
Did we leave him there?
I wouldn't count on it. Let's move.
Oh, my God! Are you okay?
This food is so disgusting.
Speak for yourself, girl.
This tapioca pudding is incredible!
You've had like 15 of those in the last 30 minutes
Little known fact, I can't stand tapioca pudding
Let me eat my feelings in peace.
Max! Hey!
Duncan, I love you and I'm so happy you survived,
Do you hear the words in your head first?
And she's back
My shift's almost over.
I have to do my rounds.
And what beautiful rounds they are.
Where did they find mud?
Honey. they don't find mud. Mud finds them.
So, um, speaking of the fun we've been having,
Eh, a few days.
He'll be sitting alone in that house.
realizing how big it is, how quiet it is..
How Clean it is.
Yes. Paul Young,
Now.. you tried destroying the neighborhood.
That didn't work out. What's next?
I don't know what I wanna do.
I've made such a mess of everything so far.
No, no. Phase two is about the future, not the past.
So from now on, we are only looking forward.
Oh, my god! Look behind you!
Hello, Susan.
Oh. Hey, Felicia.
The poor guy has had two wives kill themselves.
And here I was concentrating all my pity on the dead people.
Susan, be careful.
Yeah, we understand Beth gave you a kidney,
I know I don't.
But that kidney gave me a second chance in life,
I feel that Paul deserves the same thing.
To US, our decorating firm,
Today, Subway Tile and a low-flow toilet.
Tomorrow, not walking in on Mr. Delaney
Yeah. We actually cleared $293.
Well, $290 after this champagne.
Hey, we're a small company.
Why is the glass always half empty with you?
Hey, I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner.
I just got my budget.
You'd let uS do that? You're amazing!
That would be huge for our company.
Look, I know this new job's put a bit of a strain on US.
This might be a good way to sneak in
So you think you can do something for 20 grand?
This may be the dog shampoo talking,
and whack an employee of your choosing.
Hey, roomie!
Hello....  roomie.
Those are beautiful.
They're for you from the girls.
They felt terrible about breaking your mirror.
Oh. You mean my serving dish.
Oh, you haven't been upstairs yet.
Gaby!
But look how beautiful.
I'm going to church.
Yeah. Are you aware
Well, I needed to get your attention.
Doesn't make it legal.
Oh, don't try to make this my fault.
Blocking my driveway is illegal.
Yes, but breaking into my car is criminal.
Really? Let's call 9-1-1.
I'd love to get a policeman's opinion on that.
You just did.
Oh, my. You are a policeman.
Hmm? I wasn't paying attention. What were you telling 'em?
Girls, get back here!
Don't smirk. The key to discipline is consistency.
And I will not give up.
Neither will they. Bree.
Neither will they.
Wow, if I knew Tom was working with so many handsome rich men,
Will you look at this? He's kept US waiting 45 minutes.
Good to see being married to the boss gave us the leg up.
Ah. If he keeps US waiting any longer,
Sorry about the wait.
I just got off the phone with London.
Closed a deal worth $10 million. Phyllis?
Okay, ladies, I have 15 minutes,
The overall look we're going for is very warm and inviting.
We're thinking soft wood, an overstuffed linen sofa.
That sounds great, but I already know what I want.
Ripped that out of a magazine.
This is Donald Trump's office.
Isn't it cool?
I was missing Beth so much, and...
Then I remembered that pant of her was still alive somewhere.
Could you spare a few minutes
Smells good.
Oh, it's for Paul. Chicken pot pie.
Right. You said you were cooking for him.
That's so thoughtful.
Well, just trying to be a good friend.
I hope that we can be friends, too.
You do?
You and me? Friends?
I know what you're thinking.
What I did to Paul was horrible,
And now I just want things back to normal.
This smells wonderful.
I wouldn't begin to know how to make a pot pie.
Well, the crust is store-bought.
But don't tell Paul, okay?
Don't you worry.
I know how to keep a secret.
"With repeated small doses of the toxin,
"Initial symptoms include nausea and vomiting.
These are followed by metabolic acidosis
As if he had one.
"And finally, acute renal failure and..
death."
or at least that last little piece of you
It just goes to show...
You may be gone...
But we're still one heck of a team.
Susan, how's he doing?
I don't get it. He just keeps getting worse and worse.
I think I'm gonna have to start bringing him breakfast, too.
You're a good friend.
If you stick to my system,
Hey, sweetie.
You can relax. She went upstairs.
No, I have to get this done.
Do you want a cupcake?
Mrs. Van de kamp says those are for after dinner.
Well, Mrs. Van de kamp isn't here.
I'm not saying I love this more than you and Celia,
Here. Sneak this upstairs. Eat it later.
No, thanks. I'll have an apple.
What did she do to you?! How did she break you?!
Okay, those go right in front of the desk.
Yes, ma'am.
And watch the.. yeah. Thank you.
Uh, what's going on? I told the movers to be here at 11:00.
We're supposed to be a team.
I almost bought you
But you didn't.
Yeah, and I felt bad about it...
till now.
I've got two dragon lamps in my car.
what the hell am I supposed to do with those?
I'm sorry. but trust me,
How? Tom said what he wants.
Tom said what he thinks he wants.
I know what he really wants.
And you have to admit,
We got a 9-1-1 call from 2 girls
What?
Hello again.
I guess you found someone to loan you that gun.
Okay.
I spoke with the girls. They're pretty sure
Well, that's preposterous.
Why would they say such a thing?
Well, that's not all they said.
Gaby? What's with the panicked pho calls?
It's nothing.
The girls got all freaked out and called the police.
Did you tell her that, sir?
I think I know what this is.
Me and the girls were talking about my mother's death,
They must have gotten confused.
Yeah, well, don't be mad at them.
It's hard on kids when their parents are apart.
It's actually kind of funny if you think about it.
I mean, not "funny" funny, but sad... funny.
Daddy!
Hey, girls...
So sorry to have dragged you out here in the middle of the night.
Let me walk you to your car.
Let's go pack your stuff. I'm taking you home.
I'm glad you didn't kill someone.
I'd have felt pretty dumb
Uh, tell me something. When someone calls 9-1-1.
I was at dispatch when the call came through.
When I heard the address, I said, "I'll take it."
Really:
Your neighbor, Mrs. Tillman. Here's my card.
If you see anything suspicious, I want you to call me.
Okay.
I never have a clue what you're thinking.
I'm a detective. I find clues. I don't give them.
Good night, citizen.
Good night, detective.
They are almost done packing.
I can't believe you told them.
Juanita wanted to know why we were fighting.
I told her the truth.
Great. So now they think mommy walked out on daddy
I'm sorry. I just keep waiting for this to blow over.
We have to face it, Gaby.
This is never gonna blow over.
So what am I gonna do?
You're gonna go home to your husband.
I feel guilty enough about Carlos losing his mother.
I will not be responsible for him losing his wife.
I would really love to observe if that's cool with you.
No, that's not cool.
Now if you'll excuse me,
If you don't eat, I can do it today.
Did you hear Mer just revolutionized the world of cutlery?
No, I... did not.
Working on a liver model.
Are you still going to try to remove all of the tumors today?
It just seems like it's a lot to do all at once.
Will's cancer is a very aggressive sarcoma.
It's an all-or-nothing approach.
We've come up with a plan to remove all of them,
Some will be a snap, but there are a few tricky ones,
It's deep in the liver, but we'll do our best to get it.
We'll get it.
We'll try.
Um, it's sort of like trying to get past level six.
You know, there are some, uh, fighters,
We will eat all those dots and kill all those ghosts.
She doesn't play video games.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I switched with Knox.
Uh. Ben Warren.
Uh, I don't know if we met before I left.
Oh, oh I was actually at your wedding.
I got you that pizza stone.
We have a pizza stone?
Yeah, I got you, a, uh, a circular clay stone
It's kind of my standard gift.
Oh, well then this will change your life.
The crust that always stick to the edges never get burned.
You can really tell the difference?
You broke scrub.
I'm sorry?
Your left hand dropped below the sterile field.
Go re-scrub.
I didn't move my hand...
Yes...
It did. I saw it.
You want to call me a liar,
Miranda. you need a minute?
I need a quiet O.R. so we can begin.
10 blade.
Right here.
I have to go away from you now.
Ready with tumor number one.
Okay, you see that?
Already going great. One down..
14 to go. I wish we had gotten to him sooner.
He was diagnosed already stage iv.
Typical teenager.
He ignored his symptoms,
And now he's got an abdomen completely covered with tumors.
Well, you're right. He is a typical teenager,
He's strong, able to fight. And what's better?
What?
You should print a spoon next.
That way we'll be able to reach tumor number two.
It is an anatomically correct liver model with a portal vein.
It's a plastic blob.I'm starving.
Can they print food or just utensils?
When will the model be done?
10, maybe 12 hours.
That long?
It's life-saving technology. Shane.
If you want it faster, page god.
It's a fake organ. How long for functional items?
Like an actual vascular graft?
Like a pretzel.
Good.
In Japan, they're 3-D making conduits
Uh-huh. Yay. Japan.
Why can't we do that?
Why can't we use a 3-D printer to create
He wouldn't need surgery after surgery
Just concentrate on one thing at a time.
We fix the hole.
Then we move on to the next step.
It's just a routine complication.
That happens.
Everything's under control. We're good.
You good, Miranda?
Thank you.
Put it to the left, dumbass.
What?
Are you a half
I said place it to the left, idiot.
Those are things Mark Sloan used to say
Are we taking a walk down memory lane now?
You know, I convinced him to start teaching you.
You're a full-wit. Now you have to start teaching the residents.
Hand them the keys.
All right, I get it. Point made.
I know. It's just so fun.
There she is. Number eight.
Right smack in the middle of the liver.
Let's skip it.
Skip it? Why would we do that?
We'll come back to it.
No, we planned this surgery in an order.
We should stick to it.
Alex, if we remove the other ones first,
Let's just come back to it.
It's the hardest one.
If it turns out we can't remove it,
Ah, you still have the ring.
But you're seeing other people, obviously.
Um, yeah. We are.
I'm so sorry. That was way too personal.
I just out of a job interview
I'm just not used to it.
Uh, we don't do things like this at Seattle Pres.
Well, then, come work here.
Because we do way too personal on a daily basis.
We'll isolate the vessels,
I can do it.
I don't know if you can, Mer.
It might be better just to close him.
No blue.
Nice work, you guys.
Let's also get a bubble test.
Do we need both?
We need to be absolutely sure that there's no leak.
If there's a breakdown somewhere in the anastomosis,
Is that what you want for the patient, Wilson?
No, ma'am.
You know, bubble test only takes a second.
So, uh, Wilson, as I inject air into the N.G. Tube.
No, no, it's a.. good exhausted.
I've been stuck in this bed,
And now I wanna be myself again.
Ready to get back to my feet and...
be the doctor I used to be.
I lost myself there for a while. Kepner.
But now I'm ready to get myself back.
And it will be fine!
There won't be enough functioning liver to support this kid.
I think it will, and I will stop before I'm too deep.
You print one damn fork, and now you think
Alex, I am in the middle of dividing this kid's liver.
And I need this conversation to be over!
Oh, you gonna pull rank on me again?
Is that how the decision's made?
You could 2
What?
An alliance between me and the fuckin' FBI?
No, no, between you and me.
I can help you, Jimmy, and you can help me.
Listen, the whole fucking game has changed.
And I'm not trying to clean up Southie.
Fuck that! I fuckin' love this place.
Hey, buddy. Got a question for you.
What are you gonna do with the rest of that?
Not drink it.
No, buddy, you got to drink every drop of that. You know why?
That is pure vitamin C,
It's true. Go on. Put it away.
Good boy.
So...
Do you feel like, maybe,
Oh, I remember. Something did happen.
Yeah? What happened?
Timmy. He's the kid who's always trying to trip me.
And he stole my coloring pencils off my desk when my back was turned.
So I punched him in the face.
Good boy.
Jimmy.
Hey. Let me ask you a question..
Is that why you think you got in trouble?
All right. I need you to listen very carefully to what I'm sayin'
You got to learn from these things, right?
Here's the deal.. you did not.
get in trouble because you punched this sneaky brat in the face. Not at all.
You got in trouble
Jimmy?
I really don't think that that's the right thing to be teaching your kid.
No, that's absolutely what I should be tellin' him, babe.
So, the lesson you got to learn is this..
it's not what you do, it's when and where you do it,
You follow?
Yes, I follow.
Punch people when no one's looking.
That's exactly right.
If nobody sees it..
it didn't happen.
Well, look what crawled out of the gutter.
Good afternoon, Officer Flynn.
What happened? I must've been doing 30 in a 25.
Why don't you do your fucking job
Do your fucking job!
I'm doing my fuckin' job.
I'm sure the officer didn't stop us by accident.
You wouldn't happen to be carrying a message, now, would you?
In fact, I am.
Gerry Angiulo sends his regards.
Says he doesn't like finding his boys
He also said he's confident
Listen, motherfucker,
Fuck you!
Close the fucking door.
I got to tell you something, Officer Flynn.
It's a sad day when a native son takes up with his oppressor.
There's a word for that back home, you know.
Penalty's death.
I never trusted Flynn. He's a fucking prick.
Take it easy, will you?
Even as kids, he was a fuckin' prick!
A fuckin' prick.
Please, calm down.
Swear to God, I'm gonna fuckin' kill him.
I'll fucking kill that Flynn.
Take it easy, will you?
This is business.
I couldn't have said it any better.
You're a liaison. You pretty much do whatever you want.
And no one's gonna raise an eyebrow
There's just one restriction on our side...
you can't kill anybody, Jimmy.
Kevin, did you know that Whitey was an informant?
No, I didn't know.
I mean, he hated rats.
We fuckin' buried rats, especially our own.
I mean, I knew he had his connections in the FBI.
I knew he had his sources.
But I figured he was playing them like he did everybody else.
But obviously, he had a plan.
Where do you get the energy for that shit, Jimmy?
Hey, Steve. Hang on a minute.
We've known each other a long fuckin' time.
Can I trust you, Stevie?
You know you can trust me.
Good.
The lottery, Jimmy?
What can I tell you, Billy boy?
I went in on a ticket as a lark,
Would you say Winter Hill was thriving?
We were making a lot of money.
Which meant we had to pay off a lot of people,
Local street cops, feds, whatever.
We were throwing money around like crazy.
And then there was those trips to Miami.
Fuck me.
Yeah, "fuck me" and fuck you is right.
An hour ago, I got a wet shave in a barbershop
Jesus, John.
Do you want to talk about who's a valuable asset, Charles?
In five fucking years of
And giving them 40 bucks to go around the corner
Fuck that. This, on the other hand
No one else.
Jimmy always had a plan.
Like him giving up Angiulo's address at 98 Prince Street.
Now, that was a smart play...
because it kept Connolly, you know...
off our backs.
We had stuff going on in Florida.
Situation down there was changing, and not for the better.
Roger?
Thank you, Alan.
It's an exciting time for Jai alai,
John Callahan has us poised for great success.
I can't believe people pay to watch this shit.
Well, they fucking love it, Stevie.
They fucking love to bet on it. That's making us very rich.
But who knows for how much longer with Wheeler moving in?
Guy's a fucking double-barreled prick.
But at least we still got this.
Oh, no, no, no. You give that to Kevin, not me.
All right.
So, what's the problem with this Wheeler guy? What's his deal?
What sign did I have that you could change, Stoick?
That anyone on Berk could?
I pleaded so many times
This is why I never married.
This, and one other reason.
Go on,
You're as beautiful as the day I lost you.
Could this day get any worse?
Uh, let me see.
We're gonna jump into freezing cold water
Please, ladies first.
You are a steaming heap of dragon.
Take that!
Okay, I love you again.
Oh, pathetic.
You can still jump.
So, are we going to save your dragons
Check every trap.
They're here somewhere.
Meatlug?
Anyone coming?
I don't know, you just keep doing what you're doing
Thank you for saving my life
Mom, you'd never even recognize it.
Where we used to make weapons,
We-we even fix dragon teeth.
You-you wouldn't believe how much everything's changed.
Aye, your son's changed Berk for the better.
I think we did well with this one, Val
I got it.
I'll swim and sail on savage seas
Will stop me on my...  journey
If you will promise me your heart
And love me for eternity
And I would keep you from all harm
Oh, you know, catching up with mom.
That's your mother?!
Well, now you know where I get my dramatic flair.
The Alpha!
Now we have a fight!
Show them what you got, bud.
Attaboy!
I've waited a long time for this.
You cannot take our dragons!
They are controlled by the Alpha!
Then it's a good thing I brought a challenger.
Another one?
That is a class ten! Class ten!
Okay, change of plan.
No dragon can resist the Alpha's command
T-toothless, you okay, bud? What's going on?
Witness true strength.
The strength of will over others.
In the face of it,
He belongs to the Alpha.
But, please, O great dragon master,
He will not miss a second time.
It wasn't your fault, bud.
They... made you do it.
Uh: yeah.
Why do you ask?
You know, we have the extra bedroom,
Oh, my God, that's so generous!
It's the least we can do.
What's going on?
Well, our friend Rai moved into my old room,
Well, what do you think the loss of your room represents?
Beverly, you know I hold you in high esteem.
Can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer,
Very well, but, uh, if you don't mind,
Now...
You've recently moved in with Dr. Fowler, yes?
I have.
Clearly, your old room represents an escape hatch,
I hadn't thought about that.
And don't start thinking about it now!
Hello, Amy.
That's not true!
She said defensively.
This isn't about me and Sheldon.
This is about Raiesh moving in with Leonard and Penny.
Interesting.
They've found a need to take yet another roommate.
Seems they're avoiding some harsh realities themselves.
I had no idea
Boy, you're good.
That is the word on the street, dear.
Maybe moving in was a bad idea.
I haven't been here one day, I'm already causing problems.
You didn't do anything. It's Sheldon.
That'd make a nice needlepoint pillow.
So, relax. We're happy to have you.
Do you actually pay for that haircut?
That'll do it.
Hey, Raj, I owe you an apology.
Look, could you please put your dog on a leash?
Sheldon, she's fine.
Well, then at least hold her still
Rai, I let my emotions get the best of me,
Thank you. I appreciate that.
No, I can't take all the credit.
Beverly pointed out that I'm experiencing insecurities
What are you talking about? We're fine.
Yes, you're fine as long as you have a buffer
It used to be me.
Now it's Rai and his attack Tribble.
Anyway, I'm sorry for everything.
Why are you saying we have marital problems?
We don't have marital problems!
I see. You must be yelling at me out of wedded bliss.
Look, just because we took our friend in does not mean
Yeah, this is a special circumstance.
Sheldon mentioned you tried to get your brother
Yeah, well, a circumstance can happen twice
Do you agree with that?
Well, now that you point it out..
Are you kidding me?
We do seem to keep finding roommates.
Now you're taking her side?
Dear, I would never come between you and Leonard.
That's for your parade of roommates to do.
Howard?
It's me! It's just me!
What are you doing here?!
Leonard and Penny were arguing...
Not on my watch!
It's fine. It's just Rai.
You can hit him with the bat, but it's fine.
And if my heart stops, just let me go.
I'm sorry, guys.
Sheldon was upset, Leonard and Penny were fighting.
I just wanted to go someplace where I wasn't causing problems.
I'll say it again.
India.
Can I just stay in the garage?
Don't do that. We'll make up the couch for you
The fever can last at least five days with it.
It's not that unusual.
I-I've been tracking the spikes in his fever,
Roseola, shingles, lupus.
I just...
I can't explain it, but I know my kid.
This is not a virus. I just.. feel it.
Come on.
Okay. I'll go get your chart.
Shepherd, what are you doing?
I got your page. A tanker blew?
A tanker didn't blow.
I meant, what are you doing with Ross?
Didn't you get the memo?
Oh, we're supposed to read those?
Yeah, I need you to start using other interns.
These kids need a well-rounded education.
Ross, are you feeling poorly rounded?
No, sir. I'm very rounded.
See? He's very rounded.
Hey. I heard about the accident. A tanker blew?
A tanker didn't blow.
Bailey, I haven't seen you
Oh, speaking of which, when can I have my genome mapped?
I have an aunt who died of breast cancer.
It can happen in males.
Uh, no. Yeah, it can.
It's just, now I'm thinking about your breasts.
When did you say that tanker blew?
The tanker did not blow.
Closed head injury.
B.P. 110 over 70. Pulse 95.
Where's my son? Who has Ethan?
Does my husband have Ethan?
I told her they're right behind us.
Rachel!
Rachel, I'm here.
No obvious injuries except for a minor wrist lac.
He was walking around at the scene.
Ethan, my name is Dr. Hunt.
Are my mom and dad dead?
No, no. They're right inside.
You'll see them soon. I got you. Okay?
Okay.
Okay, let's go.
They said it could be cat scratch fever
One of those medical sites online.
It's strep. Casey. Parker's rapid test
I have a prescription for amoxicillin.
Oh, god. Thank god. I just knew it wasn't a virus.
As soon as we get you signed out,
Thank you.
Well, I hope your son feels better.
Where's my sweatshirt.
I want to step outside for a smoke.
Yeah, sure, if you want to die.
Now it says that they are taking her up
And Dr. Murphy here will let you know
Call social services.
Kepner, how are we doing?
Take a look.
From ambulance arrival,
Your new E.R. Works.
Just like it's supposed to.
What the hell was that?!
The tanker must have blown.
Hey, listen, it was just a big explosion.
And it was really far away, and everybody's fine, okay?
Everybody is safe, all right?
Fire!
Get him on the ground!
Over here! Put it out!
I guess he went out for that smoke.
Call the burn unit. We're gonna need a gurney.
We need another ... IV.
Right away.
Speaking of bad news.
Ugh. Right frontal lobe hemorrhage.
That could be why she was anxiety.
Oh, cool, is it a epidural hemorrhage?
Sorry. I'm interrupting.
You guys were having a moment or something.
What do you want, Brooks?
Well, chief Hunt says I need to learn brainy things.
So I'm with you guys today.
You're going to TED?
Lucky. My roommate went last year.
Did tequila shots with Bill Gates.
It's a fancy people frat party.
Oh, you'll be singing a different tune next year
Oh, map my genomes.
That sounds like fun.
It's not a spa treatment. It's science.
Just like building new cartilage
No, you're right.
I should keep it fresh for the conference anyway.
Excuse me.
Uh, just looking for a status report
The injury extends into the aortic arch.
So in order to maintain head perfusion,
I'm just waiting on Russell for a second opinion.
You had to call Russell for this?
Not really.
But ever since I became his boss,
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Where you going?
I want to see my parents.
Sorry. He's a runner.
Honey, we need to go.
No, I don't want to.
You need sleep.
No, I'm not going anywhere!
Yes, you are. You're coming with me. Now come.
No. Look, he's worried about his parents.
How about we set you up in a room,
That's not a permanent solution.
Are you getting enough sleep?
No, of course not. I told you, he's up all night.
And it's just you, no husband,
It's just me.
Well, that's a lot of pressure on you.
Are you a psychiatrist?
Casey.
You think I'm crazy.
You think I-I skip work
My son is sick, okay? He is sick.
He used to wake me up every morning at dawn
Now I can barely get him up.
That's a good thought, Brooks,
Uh, find an O.R. that's available. Okay?
Oh, Brooks.
You never miss, do you?
Star pupil.
Circus act.
His CAT scan is completely normal.
I know this must be so annoying for you.
I mean, I know I know nothing,
Please. Um...
What's first?
Okay, are you sure that it's not lupus?
He doesn't fit the criteria,
What else?
And, uh, we ruled out meningitis
Okay. Um...
I read this one article about something called Kawasaki disease.
They said it can cause a heart attack.
That's a good one.
It would explain the fever and the rash.
You know, they dated in college.
But then her dad died,
How weird is that?
That people join bowling leagues?
The universe kept pulling them together, just...
waiting for them to see that they were meant to be together,
And then a tanker explodes,
Yeah.
Your paramedic is gonna be fine, by the way.
Ooh, Bailey.
You have to map me.
I need to know which parent I take after.
My dad eats three salads a day and has high cholesterol.
He managed to snap his elbow
Callie, I asked for an ortho consult,
Weren't you supposed to leave hours ago?
I was, but then.. baked Alaska.
I'm so sorry.
Well, hey, look at it this way.
Now you have time to spice up your speech for next year.
And I still need an ortho consult
I-I heard one about floating algae pods,
It was very inspiring.
Yeah. Yeah, and yours is just about, you know...
cartilage right now.
But no one sells cartilage like you.
You know, this invitation
Yeah, and I'm telling you that it's great.
No. You're telling me it's not...
Finally.
And it helps.
I feel better about not going.
I'll see you in O.R. three.
So any idea when the kid's dad
He's pretty freaked out right now.
No, no idea.
He's stable, but his hemoglobin is still low.
That aortic repair took a lot longer than I thought.
Oh, I have to be back on rounds...
in 29 minutes.
Should I sleep or should I shower?
I could sleep in the shower.
Oh, but I'm also starving. Have you eaten?
Shoot.
His pressure dropped out and he went into cardiac arrest.
They seem to sense when the creatures are around.
Where's Charlie?
Another novel I won't have to read.
He saved us, you fucking asshole.
I know what you think of me, what everybody thinks of me.
You know, in the divorce petition.
my first wife said that to call me a creep would be an affront to creeps everywhere
Think I would have loved them.
Maybe.
And then Lydia.
Third time really was the charm for me.
She was the kindest person I ever met.
But I'm here and she's gone. You know why that is?
Because, in the end, there are only two types of people.
The assholes and the dead.
God, you sound like my father.
Like your father? Why?
Target mobile.
Target heading north.
Alpha 1's now Bravo 1.
He's mobile. Roger that.
Out of the way. Move, move, move.
May I borrow this? Thank you.
Now complete on Bravo 1, following Bravo 1.
Alpha 1 now on Foxtrot. I'm in pursuit.
Get off me! Gome on.
The ankle's shattered. You'll need to carry me.
Come on. Get over me shoulder.
Sorry. Get in.
Hey! Move away from the car.
Soon as I've printed your ticket.
Come on.
It fills the fractures in my ankle,
Why, what happened to your ankle?
You fell on it.
Hello.
I didn't do it.
I need your help.
If I help you, I'll be arrested.
If you don't, I could be dead by the end of the day.
All right, listen.
Ledford activated someone called Chil-something.
That's all I know.
Chilcott? Oh, Jesus, he's a psychopath.
That's a kill order. Oh, God.
Jodie, I need you to do something for me.
I need you to find out the identity of the man
If I can find him, it will clear my name.
Can you do that?
I'll try.
Seb, can I press this red button?
That says 200,016.
No, it says 2016.
That's 198,000 years from now.
In that case, I got two zeroes for free, so who's the idiot?
What are you doing? I need to disappear.
There are people looking for me.
You won't see me again.
We were trying to return that beautiful ball
It's not about the ball, lads.
Look, Seb. That's the couple that's adopting us.
They're from London.
You're coming with me. Right, Nobby?
Of course.
I'd never leave my little brother.
It's all right to be sad.
What?
It's imperative no one know that I'm here.
You need somewhere isolated where there's no one around?
Exactly. All right.
I know just the place.
It's just this way, past the train station.
All aboard the 915, Grimsby to London.
In you go.
Do you think our new parents will let us sleep
If we have bunk beds, can I have the top?
You can have the top, little man.
Go and have a pee now before the other passengers do.
Lads. Lads.
See those blokes out there?
Those are Manchester United supporters.
How dare those twats show up here?
Delay them. I promise I'll burn your school down.
No school! Come on.
Oi, lads. Get the ball!
Let's go, lads.
They've got guns!
Excuse me, sir. I think you dropped something.
Dropped what?
You're in Grimsby now, you git!
Do you think I'll hesitate to kill you? Little bastard.
Now!
Get over here. What is it?
I need you to suck this wound in my shoulder.
No, no, no, I don't put my lips on another man's shoulder.
That's very gay. Do it now.
People have been chucked out of Grimsby
That pellet was filled with Lonomia caterpillar toxin.
I'll be dead in 90 seconds if you don't suck it out.
Okay, okay.
Suck hard.
That's it.
Don't swallow the poison.
And now spit it out.
Well done. Praise the Lord.
I thought I'd lost you, brother.
What? I've been hit somewhere else.
Where?
I'm not falling for that one. No way.
No, you don't.. What are you doing?
No, why are you taking those off?
It's a semifinal that has become gripped by tension.
And England to have the ball. Time for one last attack, baby.
Come on, Sterling. The ball's broken for Sterling.
Get in there. Raheem Sterling's through.
And Raheem Sterling scores for England!
That surely puts England
Here we go!
We spit on your face!
Here we go! Here we go!
Maelstrom are clearly buying something from him.
He's currently in a hotel room with Lina Smit, his wife,
You need to find out from her. You may need to seduce her.
Well, as you know, I'll do anything for England.
Book me a room at the lodge.
I have done. Your alias is Mr. Shelton.
Hey, English. What?
I have something for you to celebrate:
I'm embarrassed to say I've never actually tried any before.
You'll like it. Listen,
Are you on e-mail or...? Linkedln.
Yes.
Who's that you were talking to?
That is me new mate, Tabansi.
He flies to and from South America
It's either that or a life of crime.
Or as I like to call it, WorldCure.
At the end of the game,
It should take two to three weeks
By which time, 96,000 fans
Why are you doing this?
Well, think about it.
We have 7 billion people running around
I'm just trying to make the world
By deleting the surplus.
"Cure the world."
The garbage.
What? Every man, woman and child in this stadium is about to die.
Put this in your ear.
Jodie, I need you to check for anywhere
Okay, I will scan for the chemical signature.
This is hopeless.
No, it's not.
Look who just sat down.
We need to stop her before she sets off the virus.
All right, listen, let's go around the stadium.
We can't go around. There's not enough time.
We need to go across the pitch.
Pitch invasion.
Too much security.
Men and women of Grimsby, listen up.
This is important.
You see that lass over there?
What? Sharon Osbourne?
No. She's gonna release this deadly virus,
So we're scum, are we?
Well, let me tell you something about scum:
Yeah.
It's scum who die in the wars
Yeah! It's scum that keep
Yeah!
So I ask you to join with us now
Let's put this up, Chris.
Okay, the smartphone's connected to the Wi-Fi. Ready.
Wait, wait, wait.
Beginning to lift the craft.
Take the controller.
I want you to notice these marks on my fingers.
All right, cutting off power now.
Dude, you're getting into MIT!
These marks on my hand are read
It allows my hands to manipulate this craft
The Weather Service has issued a tsunami warning
Come on, guys. We gotta go!
We gotta go! We gotta move fast!
We gotta get to Daniel's building
All right, hold on! We gotta get over it before it crests!
Come on!
We're gonna make it.
He's responsible for the power transfer.
And you know Powell.
He's supervising the security override.
It's a big job.
Perhaps we should call in David Baker.
Just to be safe.
That won't be necessary.
We can do this all in-house, huh?
And Scylla will be gone by morning.
I promised Brad I would call his mom if anything happened.
I'll do it if you want.
No, it's okay. I'll do it.
Look at this.
He kept a badge from the police benefit.
When he was a CO in Fox River.
he-he failed the test to get into the academy five times.
These are right, right?
This is a map of the Company's basement, right?
I don't know. It looks too simple.
I assumed it would be a lot more complicated than this.
The M designates a meter.
This is some sort of condensing unit.
This is a plumbing part. It's called a P-trap.
They're all completely dissimilar items.
Logical design dictates they'd never
It just, um...
What can I do for you?
Well, I can see that you're busy,
Scylla is moving.
Come back?
Don't worry. We're gonna stick to our original plan.
What exactly is the plan?
Yes, and if he reaches
If he gets a turtle, well..
The contractors are here.
What the hell are you doing here?
You're a client, huh?
Just keep it down; keep it down.
It's all part of the ruse.
We need some help. I'm already
Where's, where's Pretty and the Fatman?
Bellick's dead.
If you joke about it, I'll rip your tongue out.
Let's go, Linc.
Sorry to bother you,
He's in and out of consciousness
I'd be really grateful if we could see a neurologist.
Does he have insurance?
Uh, yeah.
I don't have the card,
Just fill this out.
This won't just serve the rich.
How long have you been working for them?
Too long.
I came in in '94.
I was never good at collecting a paycheck.
Always freelance.
Partially retired all the time.
I like to finish a job and then move on.
Put it in the past.
Do you always leave your name behind
Only on the Scylla project.
Well, we're considering modifications and..
Come on.
You know what happens?
They take over your life.
You don't own it anymore.
That is not what happened to me.
Then, somehow you stayed out of trouble.
No, no, that is not it.
Look, I can handle this.
I'm just..
I'm just kicking myself.
I could find something else for you to do, okay?
This thing has gotten way out of hand.
What's wrong?
You don't trust me, Fernando?
Why should he?
Because we all want the same thing: Scylla.
And I'm not gonna let a giant pack
Or would you like me to call the bomb squad?
Look, I am offering to do you a massive favor here.
If that thing blows while I'm pulling the pin,
Now, don't worry, Fernando.
I'm known for my steady hand.
Take a deep breath, okay?
Keep your weight even.
And I need you to shift slowly,
Oh, no, I can't... I can't, I can't do it.
Are you all right?
They have to deactivate.
I got a key.
A legend to the blueprint.
Baker gave you this? No.
His wife gave it to me. They came for Baker.
All right, well, this makes more sense.
These, uh, these symbols
they're microphones.
And the letter "V" isn't for vacuum,
This is a line of JZ33 land mines
It says, "Manual override only.
There's a manual override.
It'll cut the power long enough for you
How do you know for sure?
I found David Baker.
Sucre. Step off.
You can do it. You only have
I can't... Yes, you can. Yes, you can.
Michael and I figured it out.
Step off right now.
I know you're Kate's friend, Humphrey.
But by next spring, she will be a trained Alpha,
No doubt you'll be a clever Omega.
Learn to keep the peace.
And Humphrey,
But. But..
Guys, lower the boom!
Humphrey, we don't have time for fun.
Guys, guys, come on. Don't get your fur in a bunch.
You wolves are making us look bad. Come on, the caribou are laughing at us.
Now, that's a moon I don't want to howl to.
Western hunt group, get back to the den.
The two of you, go home.
Now!
Omegas, good job.
Great. My first hunt, and I blew it.
Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate.
Don't beat yourself up. That's crazy. You were amazing.
I mean, if anyone's hungry, they can eat
They can always eat
They can eat berries.
Berries are really nutritious.
Yeah. Tell that to a hungry pack.
The Eastern Wolves ruined Kate's hunt.
Luckily, the Omegas were there to break up the fight.
So, you think you can do better?
Please.
The next girl that comes up the hill, she's mine.
I've never seen her look that good.
Kate is hot.
I'll be right back.
Hey.
Where do you think you're going?
Humphrey, you know the rules.
You're not allowed to howl with her. She's an Alpha.
We can eat together.
But we can't,you know,howl together.
Guys, I know. I..I was just.
Kidding.
Cheer up, buddy. You still got us.
Friends for life!
We're going to unite the packs.
Welcome back, Humphrey.
Good job bringing her home.
Wow. it's a big crowd.
Yeah. Good times.
So I heard you and Garth spent some time together.
Lilly.
Sorry.
I'm sure he's perfect marrying material.
Humphrey.
We should be going.
Yes, yes.
Excuse me. A flea.
And a little something for your big day.
Thank you.
Just wanted to say good-bye.
Good-bye?
Yeah. I'm thinking about doing a little traveling,
And maybe I'll visit our friends the bears.
Our old buddies, see how they're doing.
I'll tell them you said hi.
Wait. But you're leaving Jasper?
Yeah. You know, it's alone wolf thing.
I know Humphrey, the fun-loving Omega,
So I'll be a fun-loving lone wolf.
I don't doubt that.
Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything?
I saw this coming a few years back.
I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it.
Thought I was dreaming.
Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus.
And I needed you.
As in, past tense.
That trumps what you need. It's too late, buddy.
Sorry.
You know what I need? I need a shave.
And when he worked, he talked about his Great Plan.
Even disassembled, I wanted to please him.
I'd ask..
where would we go once his plan was complete?
And his answer was always the same.
"To the Garden."
So, where is he?
When Thanos snapped his fingers...
Earth became ground zero for a power surge
No one's ever seen anything like it.
Until two days ago...
on this planet.
I was in a place called the quantum realm.
The quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe.
To get in there, you have to be incredibly small.
Hope. She's my, um.
She was my...
She was supposed to pull me out.
Cap.
Sorry, buddy, we got a problem.
Yeah, we do.
Well, what are we gonna do now?
You know what? Give me a break, Steve.
I just got hit in the head with the Hulk.
You said that we had one shot.
This was our shot.
We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing.
It was six stones or nothing.
You're repeating yourself,
You're repeating yourself. You're repeating yourself.
Dude. Come on!
No. You never wanted a time heist.
You weren't on board with the time heist.
I dropped the ball.
You ruined the time heist.
Is that what I did?
Yeah.
No, no, no, there's no other options.
There's no do-overs.
We're not going anywhere else. We have one particle left.
Each.
That's it. All right? We use that..
bye-bye, you're not going home.
Yeah, well, if we don't try...
then no one else is going home, either.
I got it.
We have a potential breach.
I said bring them in.
They're trying, ma'am, but Braddock's unit
Oh, for the love of..
I'll look at the weather projections.
It's not lightning strikes we're looking at.
So, where you at with names?
What is that?
That is a long-horned beetle.
Nick, there's something else in his mouth,
Hair. Maybe he got a piece of his attacker.
Guys, I'm gonna need some bigger tools.
Yeah, okay.
You check the other one, will you?
Yeah, same thing over here.
But these patterns are inconsistent with this barbed wire.
Stop, please stop!
Looks like somebody brought chains to the party.
Do you see these abrasions and cuts here in the chest?
They appear to have been made by the barbed wire.
Self-control wasn't exercised
The place was completely trashed.
This is all my fault.
I was the one who wanted to get married at the convention.
Where they let anyone in.
All of our friends were going to be here, anyway.
I wanted them to see how happy we were.
Let's go back to
This is a Covens and Clans convention.
Vampires, and. unfortunately werewolves.
Mr. Stewart..
May I see your hand, please?
Miss Crenshaw?
We found the same scar
In the movies, vampires thirst for blood.
No, but seriously, this might
And.. no returns.
Heavy head, curved blade about five inches long.
How many of these have you sold?
None.
Thank you.
Um, out of curiosity...
uh, will you and Detective Vartann be
Really none of your business.
I had love in my grasp,
It's a terrible thing to wake up to every day.
I'll... keep that in mind.
Your wolf's in the system.
His name's Timber.
Hmm, how original.
Timber, here, joined in on the fight.
Wolves don't normally attack humans.
Blame the owner, not the wolf.
Who's the owner?
Kurt Francis. He's also in the system.
Digestive enzymes.
Yeah, someone drank Michael Wilson's blood
Yeah, Kurt Francis.
No. It did not come back to Kurt Francis.
Of course... A vampire.
If we accept the mythology, werewolves don't drink blood,
So, what was a vampire
Don't they hate each other?
It induces vomiting.
I understand why the werewolves
why would he turn against one of his own?
Maybe Michael lost faith.
Maybe Michael started to see you for what you really are
Julie.
You wanted her all to yourself, didn't you?
I want a lawyer.
The yellow contact lens
Michael's blood in Kurt's car
But without the murder weapon, we can't prove
So if Kurt and Thomas hacked off Michael's head..
The clothes should prove it.
They should.
You know, there should be a lot more blood than this.
All it proves
Well, at the least, they were there.
If they only took one or two swings,
He was hit with an axe at least 18 times,
Yeah. Yeah, another wolf.
Or another vampire.
I admit that a black cloak does lend a gentleman
There's just one drawback..
it drags along the ground and collects plenty of trace.
What did you find, David?
It's a flowering herb that only grows above 2,500 feet
We didn't find any of this stuff at the crime scene.
Makes me wonder what else is up there.
We know that Michael was running from his attackers.
We know that the Chase ended
Where did it begin?
Don't, stop!
Your beloved used to be a werewolf.
Michael said he'd seen me at the convention last year.
Said he knew we were destined to be together.
So he changed
Love built on a lie isn't love.
You can't be someone you're not.
He wasn't one of us.
And that didn't sit well with anyone.
Did it?
Too late! No returns!
That was really intense.
Well, now we know, next time we go to the farmers' market,
Oh, good. You're here. I need your assistance.
Can it wait until I put a Band-Aid on a goat bite?
What happened?
Your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals.
Been there.
So what do you need help with?
Amy's mad at me, and I'm not clear why.
Okay. Were you talking before she got upset?
Yes.
That's probably it.
What'd you say to her?
Well, I just asked her if I should start watching
And that made her angry?
Well, Sheldon, when you're kissing a girl,
It was. I asked her
Yeah. I'm tapping out. Leonard?
I'm gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment
Oh, no, not just a season.
If I'm in, I'm in for the whole run,
I'm sorry I've upset you.
I shouldn't have asked so many questions.
No, it's okay.
Yeah, maybe it's good you got us talking about this stuff.
Well, look at that..
even when I'm causing problems, I make the world a better place.
Hey, next, why don't we tackle your penchant for whining
Uh, Sheldon, I think we're good for now.
Ah, well.. very well.
So does this mean you'll finally pick a wedding date?
Here we go again.
Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date?
We're committed to each other. We're happy.
A ceremony isn't gonna change anything.
So you're never getting married?
It's his whining, isn't it?
It's amusing that he doesn't hear it.
Look, all she's saying is we are in love
Ew, 50? We'll be old and gross.
Yeah, but we'll be old and gross together.
My aunt and uncle were married 63 years.
Towards the end, it was like watching cheese melt.
Um.. I'm free tonight.
Are you saying you want to get married?
Vegas isn't that far away.
I'm in. Let's do it.
After all these years.
I'm really happy for the two of you.
Now get out of my spot.
Bernie, Stuart just pulled up.
So remember,
Show no weakness.
Right.
Good luck.
Howard Joel Wolowitz, you get back here.
Never should have told you my middle name.
Hey, guys.
Hey, you got a minute?
Sure. Uh, let me just put this stuff in the fridge.
I felt bad for finishing your yogurt, so I bought more.
And, Howard, your favorite fruit is in season.
Crunch Berries.
This is a new era for millennium.
I want you all to realize that the only thing
And people refuse to believe that it's in your mind.
And you can feel it when you go into a room,
Don't be a child.
Plus, he's wearing a cap.
And...
He has over two million followers online.
How many do you have?
What do you want from me?
I want you to write again.
Come by tonight.
I'm having dinner with my husband tonight.
Erika.
It's for you.
She'll be right with you.
I'm guessing he thinks you stole this from him,
That means she moved him to a safe house.
Why?
Balder's program had a freak encryption.
He's the only one who can open it.
That means these guys are going after him next.
I don't really see how this makes her any less guilty.
She doesn't have the monopoly on guilt.
You should be looking for this man, too.
What makes you think I'm not?
Now, if you will excuse me.
Yeah?
Do you know this man?
He has a tattoo like yours.
So are you a cop?
No, worse.
I'm a journalist.
That guy, he's part of this group.
Heavy people.
Mikael.
There were two key stories
The first you couldn't have written without her,
I think you are scared
I'm sorry.
Lisbeth. I haven't heard of the spiders.
They sound like the last people on earth
What's that?
It's the answer to "the snow comes early this year."
So I figure out the big number,
Father said he made his program based on how I think.
You think I'm a freak.
No, I don't.
Get some sleep.
Stay in your cell!
Passenger needham, please proceed to gate 45 immediately.
Salander.
North end of the terminal. Personnel-only door.
Tell me you got the boy.
For now.
I need you to get him back to the U.S.
And make sure that he's safe.
No, no, no.
I won't give it up now. Think you have a choice?
What I have is a responsibility to my country.
Something somebody like you wouldn't understand.
I understand how to open that door.
Shit.
Freeze! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Agree to take the kid back to the U.S. or it stays locked.
Would you like a glass of water?
Please get her a glass of water.
He needs to open the program for us.
Would you please talk some sense into him?
Fuck you.
I made these just for him.
I will start with this one, the red one.
It will not kill him,
The black one, though
Come on. This thing with Julia is young and fragile.
There's a lot of pressure.
I got us a table at Campo's.
Well, then you better find a sitter.
I have plans.
Yep. I got a hot date.
And let's page Shepherd. Quickly, please.
Right away.
This isn't a migraine, right?
No, it's not a migraine.
She's having a seizure.
I have been off of
I stepped over a line. You reprimanded me.
What happened?
Sir, you're at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital.
Your van crashed.
No one was hurt, but we need to get you examined.
Come on.
I must have fallen asleep at the wheel for a second.
I've been working like a dog all week.
