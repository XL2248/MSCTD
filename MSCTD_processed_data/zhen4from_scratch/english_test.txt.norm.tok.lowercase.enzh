two guys walk in , one walks out .
but , for now , it 's done .
everybody from chief soto to the fbi to the whole goddamn world
just something i saw on oil projects in saudi .
hang on , what ?
when it got in range of a cell tower , it would start phoning home .
did the hunters put a cell-based tracker
hey. listen , can you check with a cell phone company ,
are they gonna run it down ?
but , christ , jenny , that 's amazing .
well , if he had a name , he 'd be mine .
hey . hey , wake up .
shit .
it must be far from the tower
nobody 's got the manpower to search that many storage yards .
look , to hell with downtown and the feds .
we 're here to help you finish this , sean .
thanks .
did you bring the sugar ?
i just came here for one thing .
i 'm sorry about your uncle brian .
no ! i have a reputation .
okay , so how were they gonna
why would they talk to me about that ?
oh . they don 't speak the language of fire .
yeah , you and i don 't speak the same language .
you love to speak with the dragon . so do i .
hi , another me .
how are they getting the package out of chicago ?
nothing . okay ?
god damn it .
all right . what story ?
but enough that both fires turned on each other , away from the building
and yet wicek was still consumed .
so here 's my question .
did you want him to burn ?
you have no idea .
i do .
those two men with the pretend names ,
given the kelvin required for ignition was minimal .
ah . oh , you 'll need to find a battery for it , and i was never here .
just keep those dead kids off my desk , huh ?
there you are .
come on , come on , come on .
surprise , surprise . no diversion blast today .
hey ! show me your hands ! show me your fucking hands !
come on ! show me your fucking hands .
keep coming . walk towards me . walk towards me !
keep those hands where i can see them .
you 're both under arrest ... .
yep . you 're up for carpool .
have you ever seen aids ?
besides , tammy 's mom says that all the aids are in new york ...
let 's just stick to science , okay ?
we do have vials of hiv ,
you 've seen something worse ?
i work in one of the safest places in the world .
morning , ma 'am .
hey .
ah , what do we have here ?
hazleton .
yep . well , hello , monkey 053 .
it looks like a spleen .
what 's wrong ?
uh , a blood clot , i think .
what would cause that ?
and , if this is a primate , it 's probably shf .
simian hemorrhagic fever .
where ever this guy came from ,
it rips the hell out of the inside of monkeys ,
if this monkey has simian fever , you 're looking for
i never know how to decipher your level of sarcasm .
kind of like a level 3 ?
stick with acerbic .
code three . medical tear , lock two .
whatever it is , it didn 't get me .
i 'm observing blood in the powder .
sir , we have a duty to warn hazleton .
i don 't even know where to start .
well , there you go .
i already have the lab
the package was for my study .
i 've already told hazleton that it 's simian fever .
in there has two rare and deadly diseases ?
they sent us samples of shf , which i 've been expecting for weeks ,
no , that .. that 's experience .
look , enough of this crap , okay ?
i was about to introduce ebola zaire to the sample tissue .
all your samples were compromised during sterilization , ma 'am .
all right , one second . excuse me .
well , fantastic !
can you pick up the kids this afternoon ?
i can 't afford those places , not the good ones .
boy ...
you can walk as fast as you want ,
what is wrong with callie ? she still hasn 't called me back .
hey , ross ?
and ask torres if she can pick up the kids today ?
don 't you think i tried ? there 's an emergency ,
i don 't think he 's gonna last 20 minutes .
there is nothing you can say after this morning
dude , you and your rich boy problems .
i think she actually likes stephanie .
stand up for your girl .
so what are you gonna do ?
you know , it 's like walking into a hornet 's nest .
sorry . pardon me .
what are you doing here ?
the night of the gala ? at your house , remember ?
yeah . don 't worry . i won 't tell anyone what happened .
uh , you could probably be more useful
okay , sweet girl , just one more .
these are my regular eyes .
your dad passed his stress test .
good .
sorry . i came to see if your drain output picked up
you 're not progressing very quickly here .
you said that you would go if i set it up .
no , see , i never said that .
you tell someone you 're gonna do something ,
your family . make your children hate you .
but i don 't want to let you down , too .
now let me see . did i miss anything else ?
that 's what 's called a rhetorical question , my dear .
uh , dr. avery , can you elaborate
yes , i saw evidence of that earlier this morning .
well , it 's possible he 's gonna need a skin graft ,
wherever they live .
suction , dear , come on .
whoa , dial it back for a second .
no , she 's fine . are you ?
she is my patient ,
probably should have checked back earlier .
i 'd like to start you on antibiotics .
because there 's a left shift ?
murphy ..
and you didn 't answer , so i went to check .
i helped you inside ...
we made the most amazing grilled cheese sandwiches

roy he is fine .
her airway was completely closed off .

cristina , scrub out , go see if you can help. go .
we had to start a central line .
oh , my god .
these burns on your chest are pretty minor .
you never looked .
let 's go find mommy , huh ?
that 's when we go looking for a second opinion .
they 're all good doctors .
what do you think this was for ?
but this was for me .
at least i was able to do that .
maybe it 's not one doctor .
who don 't know each other
there was chaos .
chaos .
and to fund his operations ,
what the hell is someone gonna do with a giant worm ?
what can 't you do with it ?
i wouldn 't bother .
sounds like a duck hunt to me .
a decoy . a diversion .
why would they want just this one when they 've got the keys
and we are the cause .
but like all living organisms ,
they are part of the earth 's natural defense system .
but if governments are allowed to contain them , destroy them ,
unless we restore balance .
a dead , charred world , overrun by monsters ?
moscow , london , washington , d.c .
on every continent , the titans are triggering
their behavior has become random .
no . signal 's too weak .
how many nukes do you have ?
we could help him .
is where king ghidorah is nesting .
so this plan is what you would call a " long shot , " right ?
you ain 't hear ' em , griffin ?
we 'll be out of range while you 're down there ,
all citizens to report to the nearest evacuation center
massive storms and other disasters
the grim search continues , as people around the world
cities around the globe have fallen
the creatures just think it 's another apex predator .
i mean , we are a bunch of horny murderous carnivores .
we track it , we find it , and we get my daughter back .
godzilla will bring balance .
we got about 12 minutes before he goes thermonuclear .
i 'm saying in about 12 minutes ,
it 's pretty rare that i don 't manage to ..
i 'm guessing the breeders aren 't singing in praise of the lord .
i 'm done here .
yeah .
i think you 're going to do really well here , cammie .
welcome .
i want you to put on your clothes and leave .
this movie 's weird .
you knew that was going to happen .
i wouldn 't know what to do .
i really didn 't know it was going to happen .
i didn 't have a choice .
i will not pray for god to change me
i must be the change .
then when i learned that that was a sin , also ,
you can 't get a pass from god to jerk off .
steve , what are you experiencing ?
it 's like watching michael angelo paint the sistine chapel .
that is why i 'm laughing .
fuck you . no , it 's not working on me at all .
please ... please don 't stop . and so i cry sometimes
and i wake in the morning
" dear cameron , i 'm very angry at you
when i think of how long it took me
you were making a lot of noise .
what were you dreaming about ?
maybe the most amazing part of adonis creed 's journey , roy .
... ... is that tonight , he fights ...
three years ago , that 's a knockout .
you got him . stay on him !
and a big left hook lands flush !
come on , now ! hands up ! hands up !
tell him , donnie !
come on , baby !
can 't say i 'm proud of what our sport 's become ,
sounds to me like you just trying to get paid .
" the rumble in the jungle " didn 't just manifest itself .
will it into existence .
you see anybody else standing here with a care in their heart ?
yeah ? what 's that ?
you know that ?
four ?
the belt ain 't enough .
your dad , he knew that .
not ready to give up yet .
okay ! come to me !
ready ?
drago trying to end it .
get back ! get back to your corner !
obey my commands .
extend the right , crack him with the left .
one early observation , max .
box .
drago with a huge left hook .
drago on the attack again , now driving creed back into the ropes .
ernie .
there 's proof ! i left a note !
but you deserve children of your own .
i mean , we don 't want those sarcos sneaking up on us
i 'm not going anywhere .
i 'll protect you from the sarco brothers .
they are beautiful .
now , everyone , shoo ! my babies need their sleep ! now shoo !
now 's our chance .
we can set the time machine
we won 't get in any trouble !
it 's about going back where we belong !
a h !
but the initialization sequence won 't even run
don 't eat me ! i 'm mostly fat !
with all the earthquakes and the rising tar ,
and when we get rid of tyra , the upper valley is ours for the taking
we 've got news all right , bosses .
tyra 's had babies ! three of them !
no , she said they were her own !
another egg , huh ?
and then we can take care of her , once and for all .
i can 't wait to teach them everything i know .
i can 't tell where they go .
they 're coming from the river !
hey , mom ! are you gonna let them leave the nest , huh ?
and it 'll be good practice for them .
why would you do this to me ?
don 't you know i would never let that happen ?
don 't you know that ?
hi , and ... i loaded your pantry with gushers .
he practices .
and a year later he goes back to the reno .
so imagine if jones just said .
to bird
there are no two words in english language
no. man , no .
but i tried
and i 'll never apologize for how i tried .
hey , andrew .
you understand what i 'm saying ?
done , sir .
you 're right ... for your cooking skills ...
how do you live like this , tiger ?
your salary has been lying untouched
how can i spend when i 'm never here ?
wow .. how much have you saved ?
but your money will rot in the agency 's bank ..
no ... i 'm not married yet .
i don 't get to meet nice girls .
nothing much ..
someone who 'd make me want to live only for her .
thank you
maybe a little .
yes .... . so that i get to know him better .
come to his house tomorrow morning .
no problem .
thank you .
whenever you are ready .
i 'm getting late for my play rehearsal . see you later .
yes , of course ..
i wanted a boring name .
look at her gorgeous hair ...
you 'll have to get close to the professor now .
they don 't even bolt their doors ...
oh , no ...
mr. writer .... are you asking me out on a date ?
no ... i mean .. we can have a meal ...
join us ... i 'll let you pay the bill .
but i hope you won 't turn up like this ?
keep your foot behind that line .
guys listen .. this is my friend manish ... he 's from india .
have you ever thrown darts ?
you know what ? you don 't look like a writer .
your hands .. they are not like a writer 's ..
why did you become a writer ?
very few people follow their hearts , you 're lucky .
that he should use his head and not his heart .
i admire a man who follows his heart .
so , mr nazar , what should i do according to your any tips ?
hey , caveman
what the hell are you saying ?
of course we can. but not on a mission .
and do we have a life beyond these missions or not ?
is zoya also ?
tiger is a name meant for dogs .
say thank you now ..
you 've chosen a nice girl ..
it 's her play in the evening .
excuse me ?
and that agent got away too ... what the hell are you doing , tiger ?
and that guy would have come to know that i 'm not a writer .
where will the professor be right now ?
let 's run away , zoya .
god alone knows how long our two countries will keep fighting ...
and it might be a little difficult to run when we 're old .
hurry up .... we have to go to the airport !
we 're getting late for the airport .
sir , we can 't get through to tiger 's phone . he 's out of reach ..
kidnapped ! nonsense !
listen ... this news should not get out .
which bank has he withdrawn the money from ?
sir ... a total of 47 thousand dollars , sir ...
sir ... about 2.3 million rupees .
the day i retire .. i 'll blow it all up .
do you have any idea ...
if anyone gets hold of that information ..
sir ... i don 't know exactly where tiger is or what he 's up to ...
i 'm certain about that .
we just heard that ...
what ?
okay .
he 'll help us book the tickets for tomorrow .
might take a long .. maybe all night ... you take care .
there are 201 countries in the world ..
captain abrar ... why have you called me here ?
because i 'm worried about you ...
i am fine .. but you will all have to be a little more patient .
what you 're saying is right ...
he does not suspect me at all ..
i 'll get him to you , but not here ...
i just wanted to see where this decision would take me .
seen anyone like her ?
they look like bloody indians .
captain abrar ...
and no one has shown up .
sir. the information about kazakhstan was wrong .
there were two other big flights that left istanbul yesterday .
then find out from there how many other flights departed ..
total number of passengers 825,802 ...
i don 't care .
sir ... my point is ...
we have created tiger !
and will continue even after him .
what is it that they have and we don 't ?
i don 't care ... if you have to shoot him ... then do it
you deserve to be shot .
what have you done ?
201 countries .. there are 201 countries and you ..
then where is she ?
for that i 'll need you and your boys .
yes but those people who she is with right now
our friends .
you want us to attack the isi in cuba ...
girl ?
when you found out she was a pakistani .
whatever needs to be done , should be done now
what the hell is tiger doing ?
sir ... bablu .... you 'll be at this point ...
sir ... don 't forget we came here to catch that man
tomorrow morning sharp at eight .
don 't try anything strange at the airport .
get out the back door now , move .
yeah , we got one coming around the corner now .
watch your six .
should have brought more bullets .
but this tasted like ... there 's no other way to say it really .
hey guys , can you please keep it down ?
sorry . i 'm having dinner with gallagher over here .
you could . you 're funny . your timing is perfect .
it 's just .. i 'm having a bit of a allergic reaction .
so stay away from me .
anyway , you are right .
the chatter picked up later that night .
i can pull up her file .
so warm in here .

susan , you heard elaine .
i 'll track de luca inside , and then i 'll report .
susan , your cat lady look is not going to fit in , in there .
this is full-blown rogue .

you should 've gone to cheaper stores , susan .
she doesn 't seem so bad .
screw you and your candy .
all right .
i , um
everybody 's making these huge life decisions ,
i 'm supposed to be such a big part of their lives ,

i just came by to tell you that you were wrong .
you 're kidding .
but i really just want to cure her disease .
built of old
i 'm sorry . i 'm not really comfortable talking about this .
it was a lovely evening .
and it was worth it .

see if maggie 's left us any .
boy , do you look like a steaming pile of crap , kid .
thought you were his favorite .
i 'm assuming you 're levi , the doctor .
how is he ?
which , i 've learned , does not include
i 'll come back to check on you later .
you know , i don 't think it 's an accident ,
i think there 's a part of him that wanted you to come here
how does it feel when it 's quiet and cold ?
he maketh me to lie down in green pastures .
he and maggie are arguing .
they 've been trying to be civil for our sake ,
well , that would be hard

uh , vic , wait . i , um ...
i-i won 't do it again .
deal . okay .
bye . bye .
the good news is , when the truth is out ..

yellow .
besides , when you 're in the room ,
excuse me .
and good morning to you .
i 'm thinking we should hang .
look , one woman at a bar is just sad .
so what do you say ?
that 's a lovely offer , but i think i 'm gonna pass .
we gotta get back in the game ,
really . renee , that is just not how i like to meet men .
let the stud hunt begin .
you okay ?
yeah .
most of my friends were either stuffed or plastic .
tom the college nerd .
hey , i was plenty cool in college .
so ... what do you say ?
i couldn 't feel happier than i do right now .
yeah .
no . i think it says " credit card declined . "
i 've been selling a lot of my jewelry .
out there and keep selling .
i can 't spend the rest of my life
i have to find her .
but sanchez is a pretty common name .
but i know something the hospital doesn 't .
she lived in el paso , and she was so excited to have
so you think you can find her ?
carlos is on board with this , right ?
okay . inside .
it 's about your christmas gift .
look closely . the buttons are shiny .
i have never seen so many sweater sets .
there is nothing wrong with my clothing .
oh , i don 't think so . he just left .
now you think i should play
okay , before you do anything hasty ,
renee , wait . please don 't go home with keith .
oh , he 's the one you like , isn 't he ?
aw , gee , then chip won 't ask me to the prom .
oh , it 's getting late .
keith , hi . it 's bree .
nope . nobody tells me anything .
okay , fine . they think he 's a murderer .
felicia tillman framed him .
what do you mean ?
her sister martha was murdered . and , all due respect ,
felicia may be a few fingers short of a high five ,
i guess all that 's left is a little vacuuming .
maxine says i can 't go back online
fine . i am sorry , okay ?
what was going through your mind ?
see , my family 's in virginia ,
and even with that extra money .
i know . probably shouldn 't have bought all that .
every once in a while , you want a little splurge .
but ... definitely by the end of the year ,
how long have you been doing this ?
hey , um ... would you mind if we just stayed home
no tie ?
dang it , susan ! why ?
oh . i think we should save that money
i had a lovely time at the poker game the other day .
well ..
what 's her name ? martha something .
i guess felicia tillman spread her poison pretty wide .
i did not have you pegged as a stoner .
there 's a lot that you don 't know about me .
where are you going ?
then i gotta turn that bong i made back into a lamp .
we found them .
yeah .
yep .
hopefully we 're not too late .
hey ...
got some good news , sir .

i hit him with a shovel , man !
so i just , i tied him up and in put him in the back room
but charles westmoreland did ,
now , d.b. stopped at the station in american fork ,
the money .
from american fork , he couldn 't have gone further
those cons are in one of these towns ,
we 're gonna have to dig up the floor to get to it .
well , the company will cover all costs .
it 'll look as good as new .
one way or another we 'll be out of here today .
we wouldn 't

what 's it called ?
whoa , whoa . what are you doing ? !
they 're here .
who 's there ?
you okay ?
can you tell me what happened ?
i made him a peanut butter sandwich .
and once the kids went to sleep ,
and afterwards , i 'd just sit there
rub her lotion on , comb her hair .
this is my partner , jay pritchett .
not in the least .
we want this lot ,
it 's not about the huge profits .
oh , i know all about dreams .
good luck to you , gentlemen .
would you get ahold of yourself .
he 'll be back .
whether you meant it or not , this is my dream .
and we will .
i 'm gonna pogo it .
oh , thank god you 're here . it 's a nightmare .
telling them there 's no more overtime was bad ,
sales-wise we didn 't exactly have
you 're a drama queen !
the game is on , solve it !
no chance for you to be a hero this time , mr holmes .
to the very best of times , john .
how is this possible ?
i 've only been gone four minutes .
who needs me this time ?
is it intentional ?
said you were out , insisted on waiting .
didn 't you ask her what she wanted ?
why didn 't you ask her ?
good afternoon . i am sherlock holmes ,
holmes !
you have come to this agency as a last resort ,
all of this is , of course , perfectly evident from your perfume .
yes , her perfume , which brings insight to me and disaster to you .
begin what ?
oh , you have a case , then , a new one ?
i shall have to go deep .
myself .
am i not beautiful , thomas ?
who ..
what does it look like , my handsome friend ?
dr hooper , i asked mr holmes to come here . cooperate .
there are two " features of interest , "
you do , actually , quite a lot .
she has been categorically identified .
then who was that in limehouse last night ?
it can 't have been . she was dead , she was here .
he had no reason to lie , could hardly have been mistaken .
a what ? !
hmm ? you know ?
this whole thing could have been planned .
how breathtakingly prescient of her .
then what 's your theory ?
i , i don 't understand ...
really ?
amazinq .... what one has to do to get ahead in a man 's world .
get back to work !
not yet .
and i shall have to go deeper still .
and then under very unexpected circumstances .
hush , please , this is a matter of supreme importance .
i can tell .
i know when you 're hiding stuff .
you 're growing up so fast .
but every day you 're getting stronger and smarter .
people would always look at us .
they probably thought we were a christian singing group .
i wouldn 't trade that memory for anything .
love bites , doesn 't it ?
he was really sweet .
but trust me , i 'm never seeing him again .
it cost you one guy to face the truth .
now you can move on just like tom .
mm-hmm .
what ?
yeah . why ? is that bad ?
doesn 't she know bree 's an alcoholic ?
well .. at least this helps explain the way bree 's been acting lately .
how could we not know this ?
we 're your friends . we wanna help .
aof jou .
talk to us , sweetie . why are you behaving like this ?
it 's not like we can 't see what 's going on .
wow , can 't hide anything from you girls , huh ?
what ?
how 'd that little nugget of information
it 's not a joke .
or the " in crowd " at the virgin terminal ?
you can make all the death threats you want ,
hey , everybody !
judy , big gal , little beard ?
it 's pretty quiet over there these days .
seriously . i haven 't been this excited

i mean unless i run into a republican senator
but dat key though ?
wait , should someone make a speech ?
yes ! rise , gate , rise !
yes , i 'm drunk with power .

the one day the airport isn 't crowded .
you will cry there for sure .
i guess i 've got that at least .
hey , would you feel better if you held my giant keys ?
welcome , you 're our first customer .
is it you ?
welcome , everyone .
what do a rubik 's cube and a penis have in common ?
a rubik 's cube was a popular ' 80s toy .
what do a walrus and a tupperware have in common ?
something about a seal being tight ..
he says , " what 's up , you ? "
it 's really been a long time for you , hasn 't it ?
tough crowd .
oh come on , han . loosen up .
oh , no .
did i mention " no " ?
this is a disaster .
i needed those fake papers to renew my fake green card .
since when do you care about expiration dates ?
sophie will never believe that i 'm not marrying her
oleg is a bad cook .
but somehow , when they get together , magic .

unpaid balance ? i-i don 't get it .
yeah , and insurance doesn 't take care of everything .
but accounting 's been pressuring me since the merger ,

laura ? laura , can you hear me ?
she 's struggling , but she 's hanging on .
i 'm sorry. no. you 're too unstable to move .
i just want to hold her . mm-hmm .
she can 't go before she 's ever even been held .
push 10 of diazepam
doubt it. at this rate ,
so what , you 're just gonna stand there and watch her die ?
that sucks .
i 'm sorry .
these aren 't people who hear the word no .
you 've been with this boy since day one .
don 't walk away now
in your hands ... is it impossible ?
okay , i 'll do it . i 'll try .
i had perfect grades , perfect record ,
want to hear about my childhood ?
i 'll just , uh , think about it quietly in my own head .
let 's take a look .
end-tidal c-0-2 just dropped from 34 to 22 .
she has a new murmur .
she was not crashing .
i handled it , and she 's fine .

i mean really tell me ,
damn it . i need more light .
pressure 's dropping to 68 over 40. pulse is racing .

and then he stopped taking my calls ,
you know , i knew that sweater wasn 't stolen .
although you look amazing in black . damn you .
.. " leaving 17 dead and thousands without power . "
he 's heard worse .
well you can stand then .
for not telling me your name

yeah sure .
i like to sit and people watch .

i 'm sorry .
she 's avoiding me . she won 't answer my pages .
well , you guys are together now , right ?
you 're just pissed she 's not here
your friends , though ,
it 's how we learn , by doing .
anyway , there 'll always be surgeries .
that 's not true .
he likes you
you are delusional .
bloody hell .
that can damage the endothelium
dr. sloan , i w
i mean , these residents are running around

i don 't know if i 'm more jealous of alex
there 's something wrong with all of us . george
here
i told her i love her before a solo surgery .
and now she 's not gonna show up and i 'm freaking out
but first , a silent prayer for our fallen captain marcus .
this is boring . is he dead ?
babies need to sleep a lot
every time .
thanks . i designed it myself .
i 'm so jealous you know what you want to do with your life .
or , you know , aim higher .
oh , my g

yeah , that wasn 't half bad .
no , no , no . that 's what i needed .
it just made me better .
oh , yeah .
so bring it , jay !
you 're the worst thing to happen to golf
and he wasn 't just talking to phil .

oh , no . that 's my landlady . she 's cool .
well , she 's not that cool .
well , what do you mean ?
you left it in the printer .
yeah , for a house in baltimore .
he 's only back because he wants something .
i just know we 're not safe here .
it couldn 't be that he wants to be in my life , that he loves me .
i found that out the hard way ,
i 'm staying here with my father .
it 's not really a good time .
well , that sounds boring . i know .
bree , you don 't understand .
i 'd hate for him to be around en you had another attack of delayed morality ,
he is my son , too .
oh , shut up already .
i could swing by and pick you up , if you want .
dylan , your father and i need to talk .. in private .
yes , you are .
i do .
at 's why i 've forgiven you for kidnapping our daughter .
wayne
i still think we could be happy together .

all right , look , i know we have to do something , but this woman 's our friend .
um , doug 's gay .
he got me in with open space though ,
oh , thank you , yeah , i 'm done .

and they just had their first child .
well , yeah .

yes we do .
merry christmas ! merry christmas ! merry christmas !
thank god .
but what worries me are the memory tests that i sent you for .
and there is evidence of decline in your level of mental function .
what , in particular , would you be looking for ?
it would be rare for someone as young as yourself
i really didn 't think that would be necessary .
are we both here on the 17th ?
un-huh , phil and diane were saying , they might come to town for the weekend .
till it 's clean .
what time is it ?
i 've um , i 've got something wrong with me .

i think you 're doing great recently .
i wish i had cancer .
no , i do . i mean it . i mean ,
in 2013 , we completed exterior repairs ,
we also took away a lot of the old security doors .
i don 't know if you 've experienced this yet with your parents
so we redefined activities to include
starting with knowing about the person
that 's heartbreaking
families and friends are welcome any hour , day or night .
well , sunday is the day they usually come by .
that 's a chair alarm ,
it 's just a precautionary measure .
we do have mainly female residents here , but there are men .
do you want to try lunesta ?
that 's very strong
oh i love it here .

i just don 't know how i can help you , mateo .
look , we thought they were dead .

i know i shot other people , too . i just .. i just can 't remember !
shit .
what did you do with it ?
threw it in the trash
now , sir ..

you know who sam 's old man is ?
jesus . what 'd you get yourself into ?
he wants me to find the guy and hand him over .
i 'm gonna find this son of a bitch and hand him over .
you and i have seen enough dead bodies of people
i just need a little time to get out from underneath this .
i 'll tell you what i 'm gonna do .
it was all about the money , huh , chris ?

ie 's a monster .
he raped me .. again and again .
you promised to help me get out of here .
drop your fuckin ' guns .

all i care about is the goddamn money !
now where 's the rest ? !

with all this head-trauma shit , i can 't remember .
i think we found our guy .
it 's now in the parking garage at the streamline bus station .
yes , well , a liar 's word is worthless , even on paper .
and you wouldn 't be gone for two years .
well , they were from bedford and they didn 't have me aboard .
i will captain my own ship ..
up to them all we 'd ever have is a patch of dirt
he wanted things for his family , for himself .
dreamed of the sea and never got to sea with men like them .
it 's all i know .
please come back ... . promise me .
i promise .
to be a captain , you cannot be a friend , you are their superior .
thank you , son .
without us , without you , the world plunges into darkness .
that wondrous monster of a mighty length ;
o father , grant that your glorious light shine on these men ,
so , what month is this ?
which is why my friend barzillai and i got a berth .
nice piece of work , mr. chase !
corn , mr. chase ?
that 's odd .
that 's right , he did .
corn , okra , beans , i believe ? before he went to jail .
orphaned due to his father 's incarceration ?
that 's a motive to not ask too many questions .
you had nantucket 's great seafaring family to adopt you .
no , sir , not for me .
no , sir , like i said , sometimes the fewer questions one asks , the better .
i always thought you were married anyway .
well , that 's her nose anyway .
there 'll be six men to a boat , first rules in the row , six bells sharp .
what 's your name ?
he 's the captain 's cousin , sir .
i don 't know who all of you are , or how you got here ,
and one thing only , and that is whale oil .
and even when the weather is fine and there are no whales , mr. coffin ,
you need to make up the time before we catch the east wind .
belay that , set stuns 's .
aye , sir .
sir , a squall on the starboard route , we need to shorten the sail immediately .
let it come , the men are soft from months on land , they
chase , we will stand on .
holding course , sir .
best prepare for weather , mr. bond , we 're headed into a squall .
stand down , mr. chase .
holding course , sir .
we need to cut those sails down !
no , the damage is done !
capitian clemente pelaez , the santa maria .
same as always , george .
how far out ?
how far would that be ?
in offshore grounds .
more than you 've ever dreamt .
where is he ?
without a map , compass or quadrant there 's no way to be certain .
this is what i wanted you to see .
waiting for a ship .
no ship is going to come .
how long do you think it would take to trust the birds
and to be able to prepare for it ..
or a chance to say goodbyes , without a chance to make peace ...
but alas , at least those are settled between us
he told them the truth .
but the inquiry was a sham .
he ran a second ship aground off of hawaii ..
horrors that you remember
you 're supposed to take the form
freeing you to do what all kree must .
we 've given you a great gift .
i want to serve .
what was given can be taken away .
we 'll know soon enough .
serve well , and with honor .
and we get out , leaving them none the wiser .
we are not to interfere with them ,
proceed with caution .
this is a dangerous mission .
for the good of all kree !
repeat .
no . this is a perfect spot for an ambush .
we can get past the locals .
too risky .
no , you won 't .
do you hear that , too ?
got it .
interesting .
go back right before this . go back .
this is it . now let me see where you 're headed .
did you call this in ?
excuse me , miss .
witness says she was dressed for laser tag .
i 'd like to ask you some questions .
could i see some identification , please ?
we don 't carry our identification on little cards .
you think i 'm one of those green things .
you are looking at 100 % red-blooded earth man .
we talking cheek swab or urine sample ?
want my aol password ?
light-speed engine ?
well , it 's still early .
well , i won 't tell your boss if you don 't tell mine .
the accusers completed their operation ...
give us their location .
by bombing them out of the galaxy ?
auntie carol ?
i knew it ! everyone said you were dead !
i 'm not really who you think i am .
green transforming aliens ? there 's no such thing .
there is no such thing .
okay , then let 's do this .
the person you most admire and respect , i 'd guess .
and what is your earliest memory of hala ?
blue blood running through my veins .
that 's my blood that 's coursing through her veins .
you 're too late .
for the good of all kree , commander ,
you know , you really shouldn 't have that thing on your lap .
and as long as he continues to freak you out
can i ask you something ?
well , i have to see it first .
is this normal , like , space turbulence ?
locking in on coordinate grid .
it 's here . it 's gotta be here .
they got in her head . just like we thought .
you can see they 're not soldiers .
and the core ?
i made you the best version of yourself .
back here ! move , move !
let 's go ! go , move !
sheldon , we 've been through this .
afraid not . do you recognize this ?
indeed , the roommate agreement .
" number 37 : in the event one friend is ever invited
yeah . we also put in what happens
is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend ?
i mean , come on . what would you guys do if you were me ?
seriously ?
and i 'd leave him there .
uh , let 's see .
yeah , just think , " little boys , little boys . "
oh , hey . sheldon . we 're kind of in the middle of something .
sheldon , come home !
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
my piercing , blue eye .
fine .
not me not wanting one , not you having one with zack .
and if he brings it up , change the subject
but not the cornhuskers . do not discuss the cornhuskers .
never mind , you 're good .
hi . hey . slugger .
leonard .
ah , well , you know , i 've been taking vitamins .
can i get you something to drink ? maybe a beer ?
okay .
leonard wants to have a baby with my ex-boyfriend zack .
uh , same words , just less angry .
it 's strange here , too , and we have a bakery for dogs .
i support my husband .
but , you know , if you think differently ,
yes .
not to brag , but i 'm an astronaut ,
please , i 'm , like , 90 pounds .
okay , i just need you guys to sign these waivers ,
is this a waiver or a screenplay you 've been working on ?
absolutely . it 's to protect us in case of injury .
done .
dressing rooms are in the back .
here you go .
if you don 't want to do this ,
looks like he does .
why not just be honest ?
i should be honest .
that was a long run .
you know , and then in a diner
well , i took a nap next to hot dog on a stick .
i think you 're mad at me and leonard ,
have you seen any of these men ?
pull over up there .
but i thought you said
do you want some water ?
i don 't know where he is .
maybe you 'll get to be employee of the month .
there 's been a change in venue .
i finally get to talk to the brains of the outfit .
so you 're thinking public place , safety in numbers ,
get outta here shoo fly
this is my house
he 's gonna get us out of here .
oh. sorry to hear that .
i 'm sure something will come up before long .

i don 't know how to reach him , i swear .
i 've had many foot-washers .
i am not trying to hurt you . i am trying to save you .
i 'm gonna die here .
not necessarily .
if a guard spoke to you , he was lying .
maybe you 've been too busy dying to notice ,
would you care
it 's from the gift ship .
now , if you 'll excuse us .
stay where you are .
oh , mighty nicolas cage tree ,
see ya .
we just started .

i 'll see you tonight .
you always take them .
well , thank goodness i have the most talented partner .
let 's get hammering .
i 've just seen too many cases

i mean , yeah , there are people that can do this sort of thing ,
is it two hours already ?
donate it to a good cause , help someone out .
mrs. pulcher ,
i need at least 100 grand to get things started .

but she 's declining so fast .
why can 't we just give her the medicine on the side
she 's in heart failure .
she needs surgery now ?
yeah , looks like i 'm stuck with you , too , huh ?
one more lap .
she 's my new physical therapist
altman 's . she 's being ridiculous .
so you stole her charts ?
grey , sit . i need the resistance .
but at least she 's gonna get in the trial .
how do i even have a shot at chief resident
i 'm gonna be chief resident .
he solicited a patient for money .
it 's against so many rules .
but instead , she 'll probably leave it to her cats ,
callie .
sofia needs surgery .

i 'm the tin man . can you talk ?
it 's time to say goodbye .
you know , i didn 't really care about independence .
and ..
trust me ,
just as i thought , you haven 't a clue .
so that 's what ada meant .
creatures broke through
cease fire . cease fire .
what will you gain by killing me ?
who will lead the country once you gain independence ?
i have no intention of taking advice
we don 't have time to fight amongst ourselves
oh , great . it just keeps getting better .
svetlana !
