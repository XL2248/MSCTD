with this asshole ?
i 'm not happy about it either , okay ? at all .
you 're on admin leave until they make a determination on the battery ...
what do you mean ?
rather than guard every project ,
they had built-in accelerometers
this looks a lot like the same thing .
uh ... . i don 't know . the wife might 've done .
yeah , all right , call me back .
hopefully . i 'm not allowed near it for now .
have you named him yet ?
what is it ?
wake up .
the last few hits have been near calumet .

there 's something i gotta do first .
a cat fall on your head ?
no , i didn 't bring you sugar .
you 're so mean .
sean , no !
i just talked to them about the dragon .
package ?
because the language of these people is fire , right ?
not like we do .
oh , come on , sean . of course we do .
and the dragon loves to speak with us , and you know it .
you would be seeing another you .
all right , look , just level with me .
i don 't know anything about a package .
but i will share a story with you ,
listen to me , you son of a bitch ,
two guys walk into a building , one walks out .
so , i grabbed a gardener 's can of mixed fuel ,
done .
yeah . he was .
what did you feel when wicek caught fire ?
did you want to burn them all ?
oh . oh , believe me .
i do . i do . sean .
okay . what location ?
given the constraint of mixed fuel .
that 's what the man said .
thank you .
shipping to nigeria ?
a lot of people looking for you .
what the hell are you doing . sean ?
they 're not just gonna let us drive through with the goddamn load .
now , get out the fucking truck . go ! move !
walk towards me slowly . slowly .
down , down , down . down .
tank 's not gonna blow today , asshole .

okay .
mom doesn 't see human patients .
um , tammy 's mom believes that falcon crest is a real place .
facts only .
actually hard to contract .
jason , don 't worry about what you 're seeing on tv .
come on , we 're gonna be late .
have a good day
morning .
who would drop a package off looking like that ?
those research monkey guys ?
wow . it just gets better .
let 's see what brought you in here today .
it 's not just a spleen , it 's ...
i 'm guessing from subcutaneous hemorrhaging .
the virus , a powerful one .
uh , sorry . peter 's the virus guy .
highly contagious .
oh , you 're safe .
we 'll make a few cultures , see what 's going on .
dead monkeys make me sad .
well , i guess i 'd put us at a ..
not really the pun type , jahrling .
romeo , bravo , lima , fort .
ma 'am , are you all right ?
just check the glove .
the cut was there before , but i ..
what the hell were you thinking ?
why 'd you go in there with a cut ?
you can get as angry as you want at me later ,
no , because i was using a fresh sample .
i mean , how can you be 100 % sure ?
colonel , weeks ago , i asked hazleton to send me samples
the cells blew up because they were infected .
what , you really think coco jr .
look , what 's more likely ?
that 's reckless .
i 'm sorry , i 'm the only one
ebola ?
i 'm gonna need unequivocal proof .
i just need to get back in there .
it 's protocol .
the patient is a 14-year-old male ...
fourth day back , and i 'm already scrubbing in
yeah .
i would , but i have to entertain all of them .
i 'm not christina aguilera .
let me make some calls for you , please .
you are as persistent as you are annoying .
neither am i .
ah , the recovery team texted ,
could you run down to the e.r .
we need to get someone from urology down here now .
dr. wilson , it feels like i might explode .
dr. avery , i 'm
i have a giant penis .
of course , now my mom 's convinced that stephanie
you know what the worst part is ?
well , so then you need to tell your mom that .
that wouldn 't work . she 'd just hate her even more .
nothing .
you know , you gotta stay still . let the whole frenzy die down .
excuse me .
who knew dr . shepherd was such a big shot ?
you told me to scrub in .
oh , yeah . that night was so fun .
hey , um .. it 's a little tight in here .
oh . yeah . you 're probably right .
it 's puppy dog eyes , and i 'm not .
what do you want ?
yang told me to discharge him .
say it
but when i come back ,
i can come back later .
they 're all in love with you , and afraid of you .
i mean , you pull your strings
you said that you would go .
that 's against my policy . that 's how you screw up .
that 's how you lose your home ..
look , you 're a sweet kid ,
all right ?
okay. got that closed up .
i don 't see anything .
all right , let 's take a look at this penis , shall we ?
i 'm fascinated by all things penile .
how 's it looking , dear ?
yeah , he 'll be able to stick it in a hornet 's nest ,
well , i find that men often put their penises
i 'm thinking about the patient .
does she have a concussion ?
you 're gonna be worried about that
dr. bailey knows the procedure .
sorry .
your .. white blood cell count is elevated .
why do i need antibiotics ?
you need to examine me
after i put you in the cab ,
and good thing , because you were passed out

he was really interested in your work .
i told you . i told you in the produce aisle .
maybe you were ..
well , take your time . settle in .
there 's a snow leopard .
so we have to try to be very , very , very , very still .
beautiful things don 't ask for attention .
i 'm taking a lot of heat over it at work .
the last roll you 're talking about ?
why am i sitting on it ?
that was the gift .
the wallet was just something i could put it in .
i thought it would be cute .
yeah ? well , you got a real nice surprise coming
what the hell were you thinking ?
but that is not a good move , at all , with a valuable negative .
i thought it would be a playful kind of thing .
too playful
what did you do with the wallet ?
well , that hurts my feelings .
i appreciated it very much .
so , you have no idea what it was ?
it 's a shame .
how did you find me , anyway ?
cool lady . knows how to bake .
how long were you detained for , by the way ?
wow ! ihow 's that cinmabon taste ?
that 's frosted heroin . that 's what you 're eating , my friend .

heart of america . different generations .

sorry .
you have two days to print for cover .
uh , cathy becker ?
and you must be danny .
okay , sweetie . come on .
uh , we were driving up to vancouver to visit my husband .
and the rain wouldn 't let up , so we thought , you know ,
all right , can you lean forward .. yeah .
i 'm glad you made it out .
i was scared .
case in point .
it 's the e.r. mass casualty .
emergency . i 'm a surgeon . hello .
mom was right . no running on the stairs .
i got it , i got it .
hey , grey . come on when you 're done , ' cause we need hands .
no . i-i didn 't rush . i took my time .
no . no .
i 'm just fine .
okay , this is all set .
hey , are you free ? i need a hand .
it 's okay . you 're okay .
my dad .
you just give me his name , and we 'll find him , okay ?
here . for the smell .
burns like this are really. difficult .
you wanna switch with someone ... karev or somebody ?
no , no , no , i
so you stayed with the burn patient in the trauma room ?
reed adamson . okay , this is all set .
i was with her little boy .
oh ! i 'm sorry . sorry .
you know what ? i 'll ask again in a sec , okay ?
okay , evan , you 're just gonna talk to me , all right ?
yeah , i got a scholarship
i 'm sorry. i 'm sorry. i know. you 're okay , pal .
do you want me to do it ?
three , four , five .
yeah , i watched .
stop !
okay , let me just say for the record
yang
i don 't know how he got there .
roy , your whole crew 's in the waiting room .
tell him i 'm sorry. tell him i 'm so sorry .
the kid in trauma 2 .
of course i can , i just ... i was having trouble .
i mean , i couldn 't tube her either .
there 's too much swelling in the airway .
6-0. here you go .
uh , hit the carotid . hit the carotid .
did you give blood today , dr . karev ?
you 've been described as looking ,
avery gave blood , yang gave blood , grey gave blood .
case in point .
wait , wait .
so what was the problem ?
i came back from seeing the firefighter off to surgery .
you know , make a show of support .
and there was a problem ,
hey , can you give me a hand ?
i got her labs . i was shocked .
april kepner ?
wait a second. what the hell ?
what the hell ?
we 're already filling her with fluids .
they needed more hands .
not until she is more stable .
there was so much swelling , we couldn 't find good veins .
we can 't use the hyperbaric chamber until she 's stable .
open up , please .
okay. um , you look good .
but the one on your calf might be third-degree .
you didn 't look in her throat ,
oh. where 's your mommy , pal ?
when we 're headed toward an outcome
it 's not the doctors , richard .
i know that .
for jennings , it was about legal .
i needed to know who finally was responsible .
say it , derek .
maybe it 's too many doctors ..
when i got to that room ...
because that 's the system now ..
obsessed with restoring natural order .
titan dna .
are you kidding , martinez ?
at 0500 , we 'll ship out to launch a joint operation ...
excuse me ?
uh , mark , why don 't we let colonel foster finish ..
look , they 've already got emma and the orca .
the mass extinction we feared has already begun .
we are the infection .
it 's original and rightful rulers ,
a way to protect the planet , to maintain its balance .
and within our lifetime , our planet will perish ,
and what 's gonna be left , if you do this ?
no , doctor stanton ,
i 'm guessing you weren 't expecting these guys .
all under attack .
now as before , we have been trying to lure
can you track him ?
but maybe she can .
why ?
this category six hurricane over d.c .
working with all four branches of the military ,
what do those nerds think they 're gonna do
they wanna bring godzilla back from the dead .
appreciate it .
the greater boston area
i repeat , all citizens
and with d.c. hit hard by a category six hurricane
and though this sight is heartbreaking ,
why ?
that 's how she made the signal for the orca .
well , that makes sense .
yeah , that 's real poetic . now what ?
what about moe , larry , and curly over here ?
oh , boy . godzilla 's radiation levels
what do you mean ?
okay , guys , you need to find the orca ,
i 'm impressed .
oh , spoke too soon .
where did you get this ?
take a look at the contract ?
all that 's left is your signature , and we 're good to go .
perfect . now you 're officially a disciple of god 's promise .
whoo !
no , you don 't .
i want you to leave .
no , i didn 't .
you can start by putting
yes , you did .
no , just ..
did you ?
change will come through god
i 've always known i didn 't want to act
what ?
who asked you ?
i mean , just imagine you 're all sitting at a table together
what ? why are you laughing ? you know i 'm right .
i mean , the system is working on you .
oooh
a little peculiar
and i say , " hey , yeah , yeah , yeah "
jamie , i ..
" you already had this thing in you , but i didn 't .
what if she 's right ..
what the fuck ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm fine .
i don 't remember , okay ? it was scary .
let 's go ! let 's go , baby . let 's go !
don 't drop that guard ! sit .
keep your hands up !
come on , d !
wheeler 's power just isn 't the same , and no doubt creed can sense it .
creed 's on a mission , really pressing the issue now .
creed staying in the pocket , max . moving , not running .
these two men are really going at it .
another left hook drives wheeler back .
ain 't nothing personal .
call it whatever you want .
the money is a side effect .
somebody had to make it happen .
oh , yeah , that 's supposed to be you , huh ?
i want the same thing you want .
in the history of boxing ,
but how many do you think they know ?
five ?
you need a narrative . something that sticks to the ribs .
creed clearly in pain , as he finds a way to his feet .
i don 't know . this is getting dangerous , jim .
and now , bayless is gonna let him go again .
box !
huge right hook !
and creed delivers a big right hand at the bell .
bayless restraining drago , seemingly frustrated ..
you gonna counter with the right
he 'll never expect it . his old man did the same thing to me .
i think creed is withstanding drago 's combinations
and round two begins .
and a big right hand .
okay , can i just point out that " technically " i didn 't disobey you ?
you said go to the store after school , and i stopped by .
yeah , see ? i didn 't disobey you . i just took a brief , educational detour !
the way you 've been like a mother to orphan
you 'll still look after us though , right ?
shh , come on now , don 't worry .
all of you are my family .
and then when my babies are big enough , they 'll protect you , too .
they are as weird looking as orphan is .
and they 'll grow up big and strong , like their mother .
all right , all right .
jules , come on , we 'll just stay for a little while .
.... and mom will never know we were gone !
this isn 't about getting away with something , ernie !
max , how do you get this to work
well , first you run the initialization sequence .
what if it fell off while we were going back in time ?
let 's eat them now
if we don 't relocate soon , we won 't have a choice .
soon , nothing in the lower valley will survive .
so you better have brought us some good news ,
news you can use .
more adoptions ?
and it looks like there 's another egg still in her nest !
if it was taken , she 'd come look for it .
my babies ' first night of life .
like something 's been checking it out .
jules , come here !
come on ! let 's follow them .
well , i want to see where these tracks lead to .
fletcher will never know it was you who spoke up .
do you think that i would let him put my son through hell
that there is nothing in the world more important to me than you ?
andrew
i saw that .
and he 's laughed off-stage
and he practices and he practices , with one goal in mind
and he steps up on that stage and he plays the
" well that 's ok , charlie
but that 's just what the world wants now .
every starbucks ' jazz album just proved my point , really .
you know maybe .. you go to far , you discourage next
because the next charlie parker would never be discouraged .
i never really had a charlie parker .
and that 's more than most people ever do .
alright , see you later .
listen , i have no idea how you gonna take this , but
then i 'll find you an enemy in a new country .
sir ... i often get this feeling that
and your insanity .
this decade old furniture ,
why ?
i have been traveling all over the world
about 2.3 million .
no ... i think you 're old enough to be married now .
why ?
what are you looking for , mr. writer ?
just a sweet simple girl ..
wow ... very romantic ..
okay .
aren 't you a little fussy when it comes to food ?
so you want to spend some time with professor kidwai ?
i 'll try to speak to him ..
but i can 't promise anything .
just the way you like it , sir .
and here 's the cheque .
i hope you don 't mind if i leave you alone with your punctured eggs .
you pay the bill .... . why should i ?
manish chandra ... . isn 't that a boring name ?
should sound like a decent guy ... right ?
okay ' decent guy ' , listen ...
i 'm thinking .. people here are so honest ...
i should barge into the professor 's house
like .. have dinner ?
date ?
i 'm going out with my friends tonight .
sure .
like what ?
just get a little cooler ..
hey , everybody ! !
hey manish , it 's your turn ..
hello .
no problem , sir .
for example ..
they 're cut and bruised like a wrestler 's .
just followed my heart .
the most important thing for an agent is ...
the day you follow your heart , consider yourself dead .
honestly , i want to convey something to your daughter
manish
i need a drink .
can 't people like us fall in love ?
when are we not on a mission ?
mission !
and now everyone calls me that .
i warned you .. in an attempt to woo her
should i tell you something ..
it 's five in the morning. get some sleep ...
sorry ...
in ten minutes you 've destroyed half of dublin ...
what else could i have done in that situation ?
not just him ... the whole town will know you 're not a writer .
must be watching the play .. what else ?
so let 's create our own world ..
you have gone mad ... don 't talk nonsense .
we cannot wait for them endlessly .
tiger ...
hello ... zoya , are you there ?
please hurry and come down .
sir ... i think he 's been kidnapped by the pakistanis .
he 's too good for them .
okay , sir .
take the next flight from london and get here .
how much ?
47 thousand dollars ?
should be 2.3 million ..
tiger has not been kidnapped !
how much classified information tiger has about our organisation ?
it will compromise the security of our agents all over the world .
but he will never give away that kind of information whilst he 's alive ...
sir ...
a pakistani delegate is also missing since this morning .
this is the address of the hotel .
this hotel belongs to his friend .
how long will you take ?
sir .... . this is zoya .
sir ?
and bloody tiger could find a girl only from pakistan ?
meeting like this can derail the whole plan .
he is an extremely dangerous agent .
it 's not that easy to trick him .
but we must know what you are up to and where exactly are you ?
but to get him to you here is too risky .
for once i followed my heart .
i 'm amused at the thought of what will happen in kazakhstan now .
see there . . in that car .
pakistani goons ..
sir ... it 's been close to four hours since the istanbul flight landed ..
alright ...
no one arrived there today .
one to london and the other to frankfurt .
sir .... there are 623 flights at london
and those two could be traveling on a passport of any nationality ...
keep searching ... we have to find them .
if tiger has decided ... then it will be very difficult to find him .
raw was functioning before him ..
enough !
five minutes are more than enough ..
so , gopi .... you want me to be shot ?
what have i done ?
tiger , do you know how many countries there are in the world ?
really ?
call her .. let 's leave .
why ? you just told me that she 's ready .
who are they ?
so let me get this straight ..
why .... to kidnap a girl ?
the same girl was your sister-in-law in dublin ...
you demoted her from sister-in-law to just a girl ?
hey caveman ...
tiger ... tiger ... tiger ...
that 's the plan ... tokas , you will be here .
you , caveman .... . you got an entire army just to catch me ?
one last time .. you 'll be here .
our flight will take off in two hours ...
you know what ? you got three coming in .
anybody in here ?
your three guests are coming out of the door behind you right now .
oh , zinger .
i thought they were chocolate sprinkles which i would eat normally .
like a rat sauce .
look . unfortunately there 's vermin in the ceiling again .
burger king was booked up .
guard your fruit !
never as funny as you , super cooper .
it 's not pink eye , ma 'am .
well , i 'm allergic to disgusting childhood illness .
sorry .
after boyanov 's death ,
what do we know about her ?
oh , that 's stuck .
i 'll pull up my file .
why don 't you just cry directly into my mouth while you 're at it .
it 's quite buttery .
that was mine !
no , it 's not .
i 've not been in a real relationship since jerry left me three years ago
i thought everything is going to be different .
hey , you two cuties sitting here being all cute .
his service is really slow .
you 're not getting that in the next hour .
any sign of her in the house ?
there 's some kind of interference .
i 'm up for the challenge .
shoot . there is something wrong with your camera .
too late
pull back , fine , this is too easy .
oh my god , fine .
hey . who 's the finest of them all ?
drop your weapon .
let me guess , whoever is in your ear wants to know what 's happening ?
we need someone to follow de luca without being detected .
but it can 't be any of you
get a whole new face .
do you have quarters ? cause it cost 50 cents .
no , because it doesn 't exist !
i 'm pretty sure that they 're pulling your leg
jesus , look .
doesn 't matter if we 've been exposed .
guys . this is more than just a kill mission .
we just need someone who could shadow them without attracting attention .
ms. crocker , i would really like to do this .
i don 't have any cats !
look here , betty .
not only did i become a citizen and take a vow to protect this country .
hi , i didn 't . not me .
i remember it .
if you think , i 'm going to sit by
it 's amazing . that is really super cool .
wow . that is quite an image to be carrying all over europe .
why not , just make it look like pepper spray .
i wouldn 't know . i don 't have that problem .
if you ever feel like you 've been poisoned .
have i done something to you , to upset you or
every agent gets a night vision scope hidden in their watch .
that is bette midler and barbara hershey .
i would imagine a lot if you have the watch .
anthony .
am i , am i getting that ?
i 've already packed your bags .
carol jenkins has to get to the airport immediately
this is so exciting .
oh , that 's a beautiful hotel . not that one ?

i 'm here , i 'm here . i got you .

idiot doesn 't even know he is being followed .

nancy , our guys just switched rick ford 's backpack .
uh ... i got to go warn him .
look out ! i got to get through !
get out of the way ! let me through , i 'm sick !
that would get me out of your way for sure .

possibly , but unverified .
so what 'd you get the birthday boy ?
and i got him this amazing autographed copy
i got him a sweater .
i 've seen him get chilly .
that 's because i didn 't bring one .

we 're in this to make money .
by the power vested in me by the commercial zoning board ,
that 's a good omen .
anybody else bring a shovel ?
the staff is in an uproar about these budget cuts .
i don 't know what else to do .
what do people give each other , anyway ?
shut up ! you are not a puzzle solver , you never have been .
now there is a man in there about to die .
he is the napoleon of blackmail .
the alternative , however , would require your approval .
did you miss me ?
how is the exile going ?
well , i certainly hope youve learnt your lesson .
miss me ?
mrs hudson , there is a woman in my sitting room !
she 's a client .
would you , er , care to sit down ?

you may speak freely in front of him ,
however , before you do ,

as beautiful as the day you married me ?

i never say that .
first of all , this is definitely emelia ricoletti .
beyond a doubt , it is her .
that was also emelia ricoletti .
she was positively identified
hmm , maybe it was a secret twin .
a secret twin .
a twin that nobody knows about .
since the moment of conception .
it is never twins , watson !
more to the point , what 's your problem ?
oh , isn 't he observant , now that daddy 's gone
yes , really .
what 's he saying that for ?
well , holmes ? surely you must have some theory ?
these are deep waters , watson , deep waters .

five of them now , all the same , every one of them .
what is ?
how do you know that ?
i 'm not a kid anymore .
well .
oh , honey , a part of me still sees you
i had a pair that matched .
because you were a grown woman in pink striped overalls .
they 'd say we looked sweet together .
i know this is hard .
this is really happening to me .
what did , uh , frank do ?
handed me a box of kleenex , said all the right things .
well , think of it this way .
your marriage is over .

my parents couldn 't do a thing about it .
no ? okay .
all right , nails in , everything 's tight .
fantastic .

the chief , he needed a scapegoat . it 's so unfair .
i can 't do this .
how should i know ? i thought she was here .
so what do you want me to do about it ?
so why don 't you talk to her and find out
she won 't talk to me .
it 's just george .

and i lost my shot at the solo surgery
there won 't always be fiancee who 's come back from their dead
i mean , the only time they ever bother with us
dr. sloan took the time to teach me today ,

i can leave .
i was just trying to learn
i 'm very sorry for your loss but tests confirm
i 'm dr. dixon .
please , she 's our baby . we need more time .
they could save many lives .
i 'm very sorry for your loss but your sister can 't wake up .

so if i were you ,
there are people dying .
it 's inappropriate .
you made it personal .
those were all our interns .
they picked me .
then none of us do .
i think there 's something wrong with her . mer .

sir , what are you doing ?
it could be ducie island .
we will keep fires going night and day ,
they 've been here a long time , for no doubt ..
but no ship came .
if we stay , we die .
it 's a privilege to know the moment of one 's death in advance .
a curse to be so far from home ...

we need a powerful deterrent to stop these killers .
but not about a murder .
you 're gonna need to let me think about it .
my , uh , my first husband kept secrets from me ,
gaby , why is there an old lady
i think my generic reference to her as " old lady "
ring any bells ?
guy made a killing in private equity .
isn 't it lovely . carlos ?
oh , i almost had a heart attack when i saw the price .
that 's right , and tomorrow when the new fall line comes in ,
what is it you do ?
oh , i 'm sorry .
good thing we weren 't operating heavy machinery ,

philanthropy is very important .

overall , adele scored a 23 , which is a marked decline

scarecrow .
i don 't want to cause any more trouble .

have been happening in the world .
shut up !
we have to go .
a biohazard release has been detected .
okay , this is only a dry-run , and it 's the first of many .
agreed ?
let 's go .
it makes a weird kind of sense .
when you take the stage and all eyes are on you ,
a consult was requested for a 35-year-old male patient
seconded .
there 's got to be something better than that .
she had a better idea .
nobody was listening to each other .
are you kidding ? we were in the final round !
slight tenderness to the abdomen ,
everything hurts .
i 'll grab it if you let me watch .
sorry , we 're a military hospital .
you have a reputation for a much more refined approach .
i googled you .
everyone 's really excited about the surgery .
um , you know what ? yeah . sure .
thank you .
could she flirt any harder ?
oh , come on . " i googled you " ?
i was not ! what did i even say ?
all of this .. is a flirt .
i mean , she barely even looks hurt
danielle 's the one who threw us off .
what ? are you trying to break it more ?
we have worked too hard and sacrificed too much
down .
that girl is the reason i hated high school .
she can 't just kick somebody off the team .
she 's cheer captain and squad leader .
you see the way they all look at her .
she calls all the shots , decides who 's in , who 's out .
d-do you need something ?
where the hell is mitchell ?
shut up . just shut up , please .
i think that 's your pulse you 're feeling .
again , i 'm not gonna allow you
i 've got no way to dock the leg .
okay , i need you to hear me .
it 's not me . it is the bone .
well , you better do something .
he 's not gonna survive the night .
yes . the young lad there .
you should have a cloak for a day like this .
we are to be married soon .
come on , a decent wage .
food , shelter . who will join us ?
get them down here ! we need more hands !
wake them up !
we lose the barn , we lose everything
mr. oak , is that you ?
i owe you an immense debt , mr. oak .
you are dismissed .
now you 've all met our new shepherd , mr. oak .
if i don 't , i 'll ask , ma 'am .
he 's rich , he 's handsome . he sends the local girls mad .
jane perkins spent 20 on new clothes
people always say that .
in rejecting you , perhaps ?
or wishing it , either .
leading on a man you don 't care for is beneath you .
you will please leave the farm at the end of the week .
then go . i never want to see your face again .
whoa , there we are . there .
they broke fence and ate the young clover .
what can we do now
i hope i didn 't startle you .
here , allow me .
if you lift your foot for a moment .
i don 't think i 've ever seen a face as beautiful as yours .
a mighty impressive harvest this looks like .
sergeant francis troy .
well-educated .
i threw it all in to be a soldier
i must absolutely insist that you leave at this very moment .

that 's not what i believe
frank , perhaps we ought to .. no .
it will not rain tonight . my wife forbids it .
friends !

but , of course .
georgie !

you will , sir .
come on . come on .
of course you must accept the offer .
if i lose the farm , there may be no future
you 're a man of great talent , it 's only natural using it right .
yes . very much .
it is difficult for a woman to define her feelings
don 't mind .
by christmas .
i hold that man 's future in my hands .
could you care for him ?
why are you asking me ?
well , i accepted you , han .
woo !
that was like watching someone club a baby seal .
because i never check facebook , why would i ?
maybe someone just post on your wall .
you have an air conditioner that works ?
that 's like an a.c. that just had salami .
and my feet hurt .
i mean , i can 't believe it .
lots of people cry at goodwill .
that 's odd , you didn 't even react .
i did , i rolled my eyes .
okay , well , just fyi ,
oh , awesome strokes tee .
oh , we 're done with me .
it was a really warm night , and i snuck out of the house ,
and what ?
look at me , does it look like something great ever happens ?
that 's not me , that 's the law of the ' will .
that was intense .
you said to look in things , right ?
ooh , slick . whoever hid those is gonna be pissed .
fabric sturdy , no mysterious crotch stains ,

that 's what you 'd sound like , if you talked .
everything you say is right , max .
you should kill her .
it 'll be easy . we could kill her and eat her .
all right , buddy , here 's your spot .
how could there be ? !
i love him , but if he 's broken , let 's not get a new one .
i 'm not going to work today .
ah , you 're upset because you spent the whole night working
call me if you need anything .
hmm , it would .
that nagging tone is helping my anxiety , yeah .
i 'm sorry , but you know we agreed
sheldon , stop it , i 'm not kidding .
but after months of struggling , i 'm finally making progress .
or do i , hmm ?
that 's not true .
sophie , are those all your bridal magazines ?
come on , oleg !
wedding donkey ?
relax , sophie .
that 's true . yeah .

it 's ' cause our t-shirts got ripped off
i don 't know whether to date james spader
those girls can 't just steal from us .
hey , everybody .
the love of my life .
the zing to my wang .
i am svetlana , oleg 's cousin .
you could be his sister .
what is going on here ?
someone 's on his periodical .
at least someone in the diner has .
of course you 're chill , you 're one of mr. popper 's penguins .
we 'll do the jobs you already pay us for
why would i pretend to be a lawyer ?
no one 's gonna believe han 's our lawyer , anyway .
and this area is for customers .
max ?
max , of course these girls go to dalby hall ,
in other news , i kind of like this eye-patch .
how long did the eye doctor say you have to keep it on ?
a few days , which is a bummer ,
