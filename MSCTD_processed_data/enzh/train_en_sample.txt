and she thinks he 's amazing . he 's everything she 's ever wanted .
did i get it right ?
her motive is she wants to meet the guy again .
why is that ?
q@@ h , there 's no right answer .
if the girl didn 't know the man , it 's unlikely her sister would .
depends on what you 're looking for .
if the girl didn 't know the man , it 's unlikely her sister would .
so it would make more sense for her to kill her father .
there would be a higher probability that the

what game are you playing , honey ?
what are you up to ?
mommy 's not feeling well today .
what are you up to ?
she 's different , michelle .

what made you try to kill yourself ?
her heart 's like .... one of those fancy ice sculptures they have at parties .
what made you try to kill yourself ?
it 's my parents who are crazy .... not me
do you really want to know the answer ? please .
don 't we all die in the end ?
did he take pictures of you ?
not if you 're not allowed to have it .
there are other ways to be free .
don 't we all die in the end ?
all right , finished .
then what do you do ?
will you lift your chin a bit ?

what ra gave , he took back .
kill the desert .
you know i can 't lie . turn .

nice and easy , mr. cooper .
currently orbiting saturn .
so .. when i made my suggestion to miss cooper ..
nice of you to name it after me .
of course , i didn 't speak to her personally .
the station isn 't named after you , sir . it 's ... named after your daughter .
of course , i didn 't speak to her personally .
i don 't care who describes it , there is no way for it to be exaggerated .
she did confirm just how much you loved farming .
