they believe hassan had been working with this man ,
victor has recently stepped up his game into the nuclear arena
there were reports of a power struggle between the two .
later he was almost captured by police ,
she 's fine .
our mission ? take down mar@@ quez before he can locate the plans .
n@@ sa believes he 's headed to berlin to meet with az@@ ar .
christina , you 'll take it .
that doesn 't give me the right to disseminate it freely .
doesn 't that count for something ?
yeah , obviously .
sometimes i don 't give you enough credit , penny .
well , put your mind at ease .
now , the first thing we need is a theme .
ah , turn@@ -of-@@ the-@@ century mou@@ lin rouge .
penny and i just want to do something low-@@ key .
so your theme is

que ser@@ a . that 's racing , i guess .
fucking hell !
nathan , how are you going ?
oh , yeah . need a hand ?
no worries at all , mate .
she 's given up on your whole pathetic act .
enough .
jack , you 're my brother .
are you done ?
what you 're talking about is a one-way street . you understand ?
she 's had fair warning .
so fuck her .
do you have that sort of cash just lying around ?
about . $ 250,000 .
and you just forgot about it ?
what are you talking about ? !
by the time i found it , we were already committed .
believe me , there is nothing convenient
i 'm sick and tired of having barely enough .
so should you .
maybe .
as long as we 're square .
or am i supposed to just take your word ?
i 'd have thought you 'd be glad to be rid of her .
despite what you think ,
well , you 've got a crazy way of showing it .
it 's gone .
alice .
wh@@ ac
at the safety deposit box at the bank .
what time shall i come back tomorrow
jack , all this talk of boo@@ ze has got me quite thirsty .
shit .
where 's lucy ?
you know why i 'm here ?
i 'm here on police business .
up on devil 's rocks road ?
i found lucy 's car , or what 's left of it .
so , how are we gonna do this ?
you just put the money on the ground
we do this face-to-face or not at all
over my dead body .
you go to hell !
you don 't really notice any of the scars .
well , the years can be cruel , howard .
was it hob@@ bes ? :
shall we go for a drink ?
the cat@@ ledge family are wonderful people
t@@ father made millions in coal before he died
oh , lord , not another fake psych@@ ic .
they 're taken with her predictions of the future .
hmm , and charging them for all the good news she brings .
b@@ rice cat@@ ledge , caroline 's brother ,
oh , rubbish .
well , this is the thing , i 'm embarrassed to say ,
i began to doubt my own clear thinking
oli@@ via and i were all set to take a holiday ,
you 'll spend your whole time in your room practicing card tricks ,
but if this woman knows she 's being watched by the great wei ling so@@ o ,
she 'll never know you 're wei ling so@@ o .
don 't get angry with me , oli@@ via . it won 't be for long
ever since our very first dinner ,
oh , it was simply a matter of logic and common sense .
jit@@ tle howard
oh , i couldn 't agree more .
oh , i am his friend . notice i use the singular .
george , caroline , stanley . how do you do ?
a great pleasure .
of course , george and caroline are the reason i 'm here .
when she fool@@ ed howard bur@@ kan ,
i don 't know if howard told you , her name is sophie baker .
no , i have not , but these s@@ lea@@ zy fraud@@ sters change identity every month .
ah , now , that says a lot . yeah .
caroline , you were next to her .
well , i looked for the usual devices , of course .
she 's promised to try and make contact with my father ,
there is , of course , no spirit world , and even if there were ,
and , uh , how long will you be staying with us , mister .
ah , have you told him about sophie ?
well , she gets these sensory impressions . and , what are they ?
her head vibr@@ ates ?
have you got a whis@@ key , b@@ rice ? i absolutely do .
about old girl@@ friends i 'd had ,
oh , of course . of course .
sophie sees all .
and , i 'm told she 's very pleasant to look at .
mother 's agreed to subsidize a foundation
oh , she 's nothing i haven 't seen before .
i want you to see her working
" i ... i get the impression of the orient . china . "
yes , it 's all very tant@@ alizing
because there is no sixth sense .
uh , yes , i had a bath . i had a little nap .
well , no , not entirely . i had an unpleasant dream .
i dream@@ t i was being followed by a sinister chinese .
what do you think it means ? i don 't know .
what ? oh , i was just ..
come , stanley , let 's go to ... you look stun@@ ned .
and when i mentioned him ,
i once raised a real tiger , but we both have our tricks .
i ... i was just telling mr. pep@@ per@@ id@@ ge here
is it " pep@@ per@@ id@@ ge , " or " tal@@ mud@@ ge , " or " ta@@ pl@@ inger ? "
that 's because there 's nothing to find .
there is no metap@@ hysical world .
i think mr. ni@@ etz@@ sche has disposed of the god matter rather convin@@ c@@ ingly .
m@@ mm .
what are you doing today ?
do you want to join us ?
why don 't you join me instead ?
she 's a remarkable woman .
actually , get to know one another better .
come on .
tell me , doesn 't it ever trouble your conscience
not if their hopes are false .
then you admit you 're a fraud ?
the missing toe .
where are you from ?
any other way , lies madness .
no , it 's quite the opposite .
oh , but think how embarrassing it would be for you .
is that why jenny dropped you ?
i see long , blonde hair .
yes , she had a lovely laugh .
ceo gets indicted for fraud@@ .@@ investors start losing money .
if i didn 't know bur@@ rows pulled that trigger ,
people have killed for a lot less .
whites don 't want you . blacks don 't want you .
maybe you are in no position to be telling me my business . hm ?
i 'm sure you can understand my reluctance to discuss past patients .
i 'm not accustomed to making enquiries like this , but i ..
i can help him .
what did you treat him for ?
one was a condition called low latent inhibition .
people who suffer from low latent inhibition see everyday things like you or i do
the stem , the bulb , the bolts , even the wash@@ ers inside .
other people 's brains
if someone with a low iq has low latent inhibition ,
he came to me with absolutely no sense of self-@@ worth .
but with the low latent inhibition ,
he couldn 't shut it out .
i didn 't know all this about him .
i hope you don 't mind ,
from what i understand it 's in your nature too .
lot community work , lot charity work .
the man you 're talking about died the moment i stepped inside these walls .
ladies and gentlemen , united states secret service .
don 't you talk to your guy friends about sex ?
well , you don 't talk about
so you can do it with me .
ah , and yet you find inspiration in tooth@@ paste .
that works for you ?
although , uh , kin@@ da ... miranda 's been , uh ,
bail@@ ey ?
i knew it fre@@ aked her out , but i was away .
just apologize , we feel terrible ,
well , i could have edwards tell her .
even better .
yeah .
and if i tell grey she can 't get into the o.@@ r. until 7 : 00 ,
you 'll be working late any@@ how
all right , all right , i will take it .
and ke@@ p@@ ner invited me to her wedding .
plus one .

nathan is the first one in his family ,
have you lost your mind ?
no , i
baby nathan and all of his college potential ,
i apologize . i 'll be over here .
i don 't wanna date any woman !
i thought you were gonna talk her out of it .
you 're both putting me in the middle .
she doesn 't listen to anyone !
i 'm not a child she has to arrange day@@ care for !
this is .. it 's awful .
that can 't be the worst thing in the world .
you can 't ... replace her .
why ?
if we 're gonna do this thing , we gotta do it now .
it won 't be done for another six hours .
okay .
that 's not your lunch , shel@@ don ;
isn 't tomorrow your usual laundry night ?
if this one under-@@ or over-@@ sof@@ tens ,
the alternative would be to think backwards .
so how 's amy ?
i might have to let her go .
i thought she was a highly evolved creature
we have to go outside .
oh , for crying out loud .
what kind of super@@ hero says , " di@@ bs on the red ti@@ ghts !
wait . are we starting now ? or is that what you 're going to say
i 'm hanging up .

yeah , 23 's kind of a big one .
yeah , after the flood washed it away .
you 've never heard of the black@@ water flood ?
it was the end , all right .
same as your house .
well , yeah , i might like them .
there 's one story that says that house is still standing
you got some kind of deed ?
what do you mean ?
this is the old highway where the flood took it out .
something big definitely came through here .
like it 's holding on , just for me .
now turn around and walk away .
we 're , uh , public land and survey .
who used to live here ?
what 's that in the chimney ?
look , i just want to know if people from my
chairs , tables , chan@@ deli@@ ers .
i thought you said that was you .
i have .

nick@@ y ?
there 's some guys out here !
they 're trying to cut us off !
go , go , go .
yeah , i think .
what the fuck happened ?
what did he say to you ?
what did you say to him ?
look , i do not know what 's going on , ok ?
they don 't even fucking walk upright .
he 's running something illegal out of that house .
oh my god !
stop !
no one lives here , evi@@ e , ok ?
is anybody else thinking what i 'm thinking ?
so the car could still be sitting there ?
well , should we try and see ?
and evi@@ e can 't make it anywhere right now .
oh , in the same woods where they murdered sam ?
how am i the only one that thinks this is a bad idea ?
there is no way that i 'm staying in there .

i mean , tell your friend to stop sw@@ inging that
not with those roots jam@@ ming it shut .
yeah , no telling what 's down there .
they 're everywhere .
it 's crazy .
they 're all over the backyard , like statues .
where do you think ?
go , go , go , go !
it 's the door
for starters , we stay away from that fucking door .
where the hell are we gonna go ?
i guess we 're going back to the car .
do not let go of my hand .
yeah .
or he knew what he was .
no , but ..
i 'm doing a search for the word sam@@ ma@@ el .

i was trying to be nice to him .
well , if you didn 't kill him , who did ?
come on , brad .

you think i didn 't want to pull that trigger ?

i 've got an idea while we were sitting here .
m@@ mm , like at a wedding ?

men are afraid to dance . the male ego is too fragile .
in her eyes , you 're a ridiculous peasant .
i 'm not a peasant , mr. whis@@ kers . him@@ m ?
i think that 's a fantastic idea
come on , bo@@ sco . let 's go , buddy .

now , come on .
david , come on , you had to see this coming

i 'm sorry . do you want me to leave you alone ?
time helps .

this is the one .
it 's awesome .
we were just listening
you 're supposed to put them back in the slee@@ ves immediately .
these are just things . he 'd want us to play them .
no , i guess he 's not .
it was going pretty well till we ran into you .
i 'm just giving you a hard time , that 's all .
fate consp@@ ired .
you know , believe it or not , before i ended up here ,
yeah .
but , you know , got married and had a kid , and ...
you guys are the best .
well , with all the new stuff i bought for work ,
but whatever .
that , believe it or not , is my prom dress .
my date would 've had to clean that up .
maybe we can have , like , a prom do-@@ over .
we could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tu@@ x@@ e@@ dos .
okay , guys , trust me ,
yeah , let 's see .
hey , where 's bern@@ ade@@ tte ?
oh , yeah , i got that ev@@ ite .
but then i saw carrie ,
this prom thing 's been a real roller co@@ aster .
i-i could tell because her voice got so high ,
i 'm not the best at reading facial cu@@ es ,
bruce wayne doesn 't wear a cli@@ p-@@ on .
his name is alfred , and , yes , he does .
what , are you sure ?
i thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien .
you didn 't want to .
and even i knew it was weird to hire somebody .
yes .
you 're gonna put alcohol in the punch ?
if you had ripped ie@@ ans and a leather jacket ,
oh , everything .
pointing out that kings aren 't elected .
and while you 're at it ,
you know , because ..
penny implied the same thing .
just relax , it 's a joke .
wow , you look amazing .
oh , it 's a scal@@ y genital organ
excuse me .
and for your information , leonard ,
but to be fair , the twins were a real handful that day .
what 's going on ?
and there 's a great deal of pressure
all i said was you look handsome .
it 's not just that .
and i 'm not blind .
so , i met je@@ an@@ ie at your aunt glad@@ ys ' .
is this what i sound like when i talk about india ?
why would your mother have a problem with me and stuart ?
you worry about getting your ass back in that seat in time .
and the word " no " won 't be in my vocabulary .
in and out .
you know i can 't get into that .
i 've jumped through all your ho@@ ops .
do you want to sell the card to me or not ?
that 's a lot of secrets on a little piece of plastic .
and this is on the house .
the company will do anything to get it back .
the allies spent two and a half years ...
but on d-@@ day it came down to a handful of men ..
to decide the fate of the world .
is even the best plan is only as good ..
ms : i have info on sara .
it 's good to see you .
i don 't know about that .
we 're working together against the company .
you kept your word to me .
why must you go after this man ?
where i come from , there 's something called a blood fe@@ ud .
yes .
one too many times , as it turns out .
angel@@ ita .
he was an independent contractor .
he was assigned to retrieve sc@@ yl@@ la once it went missing .
it 's the company 's little black book .
what do you want from me ?
you know that , right ?
not do a day ?
all right . sara tan@@ cred@@ i , last seen in panama .
maybe we 've got a deal .
then go find it yourself .
the u.s. government should have a little more reach ..
get me back to the land ' o cotton .
ready .
it has to stay that way ...
taking down the company sounds a little bit more than a two-@@ man job , no ?
i thought you said , you couldn 't trust anybody .
all right , two of your co@@ hor@@ ts ..
they 're both facing time .
good , let him sit there .
he was working with whist@@ ler .
okay ? whatever you need , i 'll provide .
yeah , the card has all the data on it .
i don 't know .
and we 've got to break into a building ...
simple enough .
how do you know our dad ?
your father was a good man .
look , i 've been going after the company for five years .
the plug was going to be pulled on the entire operation .
i convinced my superiors to give it one more chance .
well , when we go out there and risk our nec@@ ks ..
no , no , no , lincoln .
some people still fight for this country .
you can look for sara , if she 's alive .
long before i get the chance . lin@@ c .
what are you talking about ?
and there are some things ...
know what i mean ?
you sure you don 't want a sed@@ ative ?
how do you feel ?
look , i don 't know how we 're gonna take them down .
but i do know one thing ...
but you can guarantee it 'll be the federal , supre@@ max .
call me when they are dead .
as it turns out , men who have escaped not one ..
and stay off the company 's radar .
we 've provided cell phones , clothing , and toil@@ e@@ tries .
you pat@@ ted these guys down before you let them in , right ?
his suit , you don 't buy a suit like that ..
that means he 's full-time .
you ask our friend mr. self to run tax records .
in los angeles drawing a military pension ..
and you narrow your field from 10 million till about 50 .
find the driver , you find the card@@ holder .
we haven 't ate or drank anything for days .
we ain 't gonna die , san@@ cho .
tell you what .
travel at night when it 's cooler .
what are we gonna do when we get there ?
you mean after michael pays ..
will only last so long .
i mean , then what if somebody finds out we 're not .
if the card , this sc@@ yl@@ la is so important .
well , according to public records .
and he 's a ceo of a company called spectro@@ le@@ um .
and we gotta get this thing ..
so even if he 's got it on him , how do we get it off him ?
you copy it .
copying it will make it harder .
you have to return it , genius .
what 's that ?
oh , yeah , yeah , no .
i invented this
a digital black hole .
within ten feet of it .
like the account info ..
like the pin number of any credit card used at a gas pump .
and financial statements of ten people in ten minutes ...
and the information embedded in sc@@ yl@@ la ?
it 's ours .
just a matter of whether you do it before or after ..
tell me where the company keeps the box , jas@@ per .
somebody does .
somebody that you might have access to .
your government job won 't protect you .
if i don 't find something to eat soon .
we 're not gonna make it .
keep our brains focused on something other than ..
come on .
i 'm hungry , te@@ ddy .
when one of us could help the other one survive ?
i 'll make it quick . i promise !
why 'd you have to go and do something sos
look , there 's no way we 're getting ...
i know .
we 're not .
what 're you reading ?
i can never find a good bag .
i should probably go ahead and just invest ..
yeah , that 's why i love this bag .
do you mind if i take a look ?
thanks .
you all right , mister ?
hello , i 'm from the alarm company .
strange signals from your property .
make sure all the contacts are still active .
yes , ma 'am .
okay , hold on .
yeah .
someone posted their bail .
i 'm showing a bruce ben@@ nett .
you think it fell out ?
you think we got the thing copied ?
without downloading the device , but ..
then , yeah , i think we got it .
where the hell is it ?
that 's why the maid went back inside .
assumed it belonged to her boss .
well , then guess what , fel@@ las , it 's game over .
it took me to make that thing , michael ?
losing it is not the problem .
if they find out someone was after that card , we 're done .
does that mean we 're gonna go back to prison ?
means we go in and get it .
but i gather we don 't have that kind of time .
look , if you want us to get that device out of there .
give us some extra help .
which given the covert nature of this operation .
then you 're asking for the impossible .
i 'm not the one who put the entire mission ...
look , if the company finds that copy of sc@@ yl@@ la before we do .
they 're gonna find out who was behind it .
what if our father after everything he discovered ..
what if that 's what he finally realized ?
about dad was the back of his head .
always running from something .
but the one thing he never ran away from ..
and we got an opportunity to do that .
man , this ain 't fox river .
remember that .
of the u.s. penitentiary in liv@@ ing@@ ston , texas .
there are still 105 inmates there .
someone is playing a shell game , bruce .
i have no criminal jurisdiction over .
i know you 've been in contact with sara tan@@ cred@@ i .
wanted to talk some more about what happened in panama
because you 're a little like me .
so , um !
i 'm here .
but i also knew that if anything happened to me .
you would spend the rest of your life punishing yourself for it .
so can we make a deal right now that we 're even .
if we 're gonna be together .
or-@@ or even that we should be .
i just want to start over .
okay .
also , all electronic devices must be turned off at this time .
flight attendants , take your seats .
i crashed , went straight to bed .
engine instruments are in the green .
they 're just cousins .
the client 's gonna come over to the apartment at 4 : 00 .
gl@@ oria , we 're here to sell your apartment .
well , i-i tried to talk about it this morning ,
u@@ h-@@ huh , jim sorry .
well , excuse me , my , my job is just death .
60 hours a week ,
i gotta get back to work .
david ? david ?
i 'm back , doc .
you found a john doe in his 20s on the pavement near the strip ,
sweat on the body bag
about as often as they get up and walk away .
that 's from the liver stick punc@@ ture .
city bus pass . no particular route .
" st@@ one@@ wall 1 / 14 , day seven .
turn around and tell these guys
come on .
d@@ mv facial recognition ?
you know , i considered calling the d@@ mv .
maybe they recognize this guy .
neither john doe was in co@@ dis .
yeah , " zom@@ bie dna index system . "
the potassium and glucose levels are consistent with the living .
was dismissed by the scientific community .
rumor has it that dr. aden ,
he was ban@@ ished by the university ,
all right , so our mor@@ gue zom@@ bie
is aden still around ?
and i was able to track down the address .
casino 's three miles further .
dr. aden .. uh ... we 'd like to speak with you .
we 're from the crime lab .
lying government bast@@ ards !
they claimed that all of my papers had been destroyed .
it was a good way to cut me out of the green and the glory .
i 'm sorry . where did you find this ?
do you recognize him ?
he 's obviously on an autopsy table .
.... arose .
re-@@ animation ? this is getting more interesting .
not as easy as you might think , bringing back the dead .
treating the work as their own .
i had the ith@@ aca of that most profound mystery within my sights .
but i saw the storm clouds gathering .
for those not wise enough to pull their sails in ,
it 's a dead man 's party .
how could they do this ?
if they 've given it to some health club ...
dude . you going to tell us what we 're taking ?
trust me , kur@@ t .
it 's time to put your cameras on .
god@@ speed , alice .
maybe we can get access to max 's university email account ;
yeah .
blocking out all earthly stimuli .
to strip the self down
maybe the tank wasn 't his idea .
so , i snapped some infrared photos .
that 's one way to dro@@ wn in just ten inches of water .
congratulations . you 're bat@@ ting . 500 .
let me see your e@@ kg .
your zom@@ bie from the strip was under the influence of a paraly@@ tic ,
i 'd be a fl@@ at-@@ liner .
could this cocktail produce , in certain individuals ,
well , one of our young explo@@ rers killed the other .
there 's no fighting in the war room , dr. str@@ angel@@ o@@ ve .
.... beyond our past journeys of the mind .
alice even pl@@ uc@@ ked out the black ones .
a card from her mom 's funeral five months ago .
mom 's death took a toll .
stand back , sir .
we have two dead .
the notebook i found in alice kat@@ su 's room
which means dr. aden wrote those notes recently .
the notebook was not among his archived papers .
from the doctor himself .
she initiated contact five months ago .
but aden is not exactly advertising on bus ben@@ ches .
she kind of felt like mr . anonymous knew a little bit too much .
i was scanning through kur@@ t daw@@ son 's video
then this happens .
yeah , kur@@ t 's receiver picked up a signal from another camera .
well , those are women 's shoes .
she must have been in close proximity to kur@@ t ,
it 's hard to say . but check this out .
weather radar , off . landing gear , down .
battery power , auto . external power source connected .
flash@@ light , check . escape rope , check .
sichuan 86@@ 33 , you are identified .
when we get home , you 'd better catch up on your homework .
thank you !
sichuan 86@@ 33 , contact chengdu on 12@@ 3.7 . goodbye .
setting 12@@ 3.7 .
sichuan 86@@ 33 , you are identified .
pay attention to abnormal weather patterns in the southeast region .
sichuan 86@@ 33 , do you confirm return to chongqing ?
affirmative .
please return to your seat .
sir , please be careful .

one moment , please .
7@@ w a@@ 81 .
and that 's when the dream that was paul young 's life
this woman had no identification ,
i see you got the suit i sent over . you like it ?
well , get ready to do all sorts of shopping .
so where you going first ?
all i want is to go home .
you sound surprised .
no one would blame you if you hated them a little .
a little .
the neighbors were surprised to see him .
but he had thought about them .
the phone call that comes in the middle of the night ..
the e-mail marked " urgent ! .. "
it must be delivered in person .
you said this couple lives in your neighborhood .
and just what am i supposed to say ?
" by the way@@ . one of our nurses
normally , i 'd give you a hug ,
god ! how am i gonna tell carlos ?
and he 'll probably find a way to blame me !
mom , we don 't have any clean plates .
he paid in advance , and he didn 't have pets . i didn 't care .
that man@@ iac was serving a life sentence .
if you 'd like to come in for a while ,
come on now .
fel@@ icia till@@ man 's alive ?
i said that over and over again in my trial .
none of you could make it to the cour@@ thou@@ ses .
in our defense , we thought you were a cold-@@ blo@@ o@@ ded killer .
i missed my friends .
i can 't believe paul young is back on wi@@ ster@@ ia lane .
jack !
actually , i need to talk to you and your wife .
i think we should wait for ga@@ by .
you 're making me nervous .
no ! this is impossible .
we haven 't been able to track the family down yet .
carlos , i have a legal responsibility here .
fine ! i 'll do it .
this is going to destroy her .
why are we doing this ?
it 's so ... co@@ zy and intimate and ...
pay attention , kids .
i hate ban@@ ging around my lonely old barn of a house .
i 'm sure you see them on wh@@ ipping day .
i worked on these compliments all the way from the airport .
mom .
you know , they set their own hours .
and oh , yo@@ y , yo@@ y , the money .
i 'll bet you 'd be real good at it .
come on .
here 's what martha makes in a week .
i promise , you won 't do anything
what are you looking at ?
nice of your physical therapist to help with the move .
let 's see . uh , i 'm getting a divorce .
i 've had better mon@@ days .
don 't be .
we haven 't been happy for a long time .
i think i need to sit quietly
i know it 'll be spectacular .
hi , b@@ ree .
i just wanted to see how you were doing .
in fact , i took your advice .
i 'm surprised you agreed to see me .
i didn 't realize there 'd be glass .
give yourself time .
18 months with good behavior .
maybe i can give you a few po@@ inters on prison life .
hey , here 's one .
i will see you behind bars again , or dead ...
here 's another pointer .
you murdered my sister .
i have to go now .
what was ly@@ net@@ te like in college ?
she just kept wearing those parachute pants ,
before i met her ,
i 'd never even heard of gu@@ cci or pra@@ da ...
wow , you guys play rough .
a bl@@ ouse from the " i 've stopped trying " collection
that 's great@@ . easy shots . you got more money than me .
the ly@@ net@@ te i knew never would have settled for this .
you jumped on@@ stage at a spring@@ ste@@ en concert .
who had a thre@@ esome with two of the guys
why would she jump in a private jet
we 're not talking about that anymore .
does she really need to score bonus points
oh , drop it , tom .
when she made that ... " aw , "
well , maybe you should tell her how you feel .
in fact , i am going to tell her a lot more than that .
and i won 't let anything change that .
i know it was a bit of a spl@@ urge ,
the bank turned down my loan application .
and without help ,
or@@ son , don 't we have plans ?
why don 't you wait for me in the van ?
was it evolving while you and i were still together ?
that would be a hard no .
two mothers . only one gets the kid .
they are shooting everything down
we have less than 12 hours to try to settle .
we have richard web@@ ber .
gamble .
or else they both stand their ground .
and the kid gets torn apart .
mer will be down in a second .
please . it 's the best way to spend a day off .
with chocolate chips ?
damn it . uter@@ us is perfor@@ ated .
thank you .
this pregnancy has just become non-@@ viable .
it 's only 24 weeks .
i can try .
" hope for the best ? "
five seconds ago , you wanted to deliver .
dr. kare@@ v , i am the ob on call here .
if i say that a patch is best , a patch is best .
if it keeps the baby in ,
pre@@ p albu@@ min polymers , please .
how 'd it go ? how 's jenny ?
we located the source of the leak ,
the baby is healthy and still in uter@@ o ,
it wouldn 't be ideal .
it seems like i was just here
you built for@@ ts and it was really fun .
i don 't want to .
she woke up really early
it is a transcript of text messages
we have very flexible schedules .
dr. web@@ ber ?
she asked dr. torres to switch with her 34 times .
and that 's in addition to the previously mentioned
there are only 180 days in six months ' time ,
calls for speculation .
your honor , we 'd like to request a short recess .
don 't let them r@@ attle you .
i mean , we just lost in there , right ?
hey !
it 's mine and i want it .
come on , let 's go . take me out of here .
os@@ good ?
god damn it !
i really do , you know , but there 's an animal side to everybody .
i was the one who dragged you out of there .
i 'm a licensed pilot , took kar@@ ate in tokyo .
i can memor@@ ize the front pages
i 'm fluent in four languages
don 't interrupt me . there 's more .
yeah .
i 'm staying at caes@@ ars , mr. wild .
7 : 00 , mr. kin@@ nick
how could you be such a bast@@ ard os , huh ?
that 's not an insult , that 's a fuc@@ kin ' insult
and you didn 't tell me you were gonna take my fuc@@ kin ' hair .
she likes you better without it .
who knew ? word to the wise .
i stay with her on account of our four kids and i can survive ,
fuck ! sh@@ h , he 's about to ask for a memory .
oh , she 'll lie down . she just doesn 't realize
so please , marie , leave me with the memory .
okay .
son of a bitch ! how does he get fuc@@ ked every time ?
i use discs , actually .
you 've got to confront him with this . record his reaction .
i 'm in a tricky position here . i signed a confidentiality agreement .
and what if i don 't record any discs ?
then i 'll deny it .
frank is recording every word .
oh ! come on !
that i 'd come into a meeting with a man working for lang
you 're working for the good guys .
in the end , he 'll just retire over here with his cia pension ,
thank you .
well , let 's hope it 's not your last .
hey , bring my ghost a cal@@ v@@ ad@@ os .
do you mind ?
ruth said you were in new york to see mad@@ do@@ x .
i 've never heard such utter balls in my entire life .
mike betrayed you to ry@@ cart .
he told me .
you think it was just one guy doing all that work ?
oh , jealous ?
i am .
well , at least we know brain surgery
you got to be more than 180 now .
excuse me , but thinking of you men in ti@@ ghts makes me want to ...
there 's a flu going around the hospital .
don 't push so hard .
cl@@ ai@@ re@@ . you 've had surgery recently .
don 't tell my parents .
what did you have done ?
come on , jam@@ ie .
oh , yeah .
just a little .
and the twit@@ ching has gotten worse ?
hunt them down if you can 't find them .
got the flu ?
it 's making my life so much easier .
you should be in bed .
seriously . i 'll give you a ride home .
you go home .
not as up close as me@@ red@@ ith has .
she 's our friend .
some of us will make it through , and some of us won 't .
it 's not her fault , it 's shepherd 's .
he 's taking advantage of her .
okay , we 're in good shape here .
looks good .
hey , jam@@ ie , here 's what we 're gonna do .
isn 't that fun ?
and this is gonna feel cold .
butterfly lands right there .
it 's amazing stuff , isn 't it ?
yeah .
let 's go .
i 'm just concerned .
the internet .
yeah , i tried that , but
and how much have you been working out ?
everyone gains weight in college , mom .
l just thought if i wasn 't worried about my diet , then ...
so you took yet another short@@ cut ?
tina !
she has so much potential . if she would just apply herself
the condition has gotten radically worse
how soon ?
so , is there a cure ?
see , eventually , the spinal fluid will fill the cavity .
her age makes it possible .
but will she be normal ?
but if , you know , we 're successful ,
the important thing to remember is that we can save her life .
dr. o '@@ mal@@ ley ?
but if the parents consent ,
uh , in .
yang .
get out ! i would kill for that .
it 's outrageous .
why do you hate him ?
you know about him and me@@ red@@ ith ?
when are you gonna figure out that i know everything ?
i know .
this poor girl ...
she wants her mother 's approval .
and this damage is the result ?
well , getting proper nutrition will be a lifelong problem for claire .
as if we already don 't have our hands full with her .
she stays out of trouble .
i just think she feels like
you know , taylor , her anesthesia 's awful light .
dr. taylor ?
taylor !
oh , god , sorry . sorry , i 'm on it .
he was right , wasn 't he ?
whatever you got to do to get through the day , right ?
yes , doctor .
yeah , not in here , it won 't .
hopkins , take over until she gets here .
what happened ?
i wish them the best of luck .
it means i believe in the process
okay thank you very much warden .
thank you .
16 hours .
is there still a chance with that ? no .
i need to see my brother .
yeah . yeah . i 'll try .
i 'm sorry .
would you talk to your father for me
sara .. dr. tan@@ cred@@ i i 'm sorry .
this isn 't about the morality of the death penalty .
this is about killing an innocent man
michael ,
i 'm sorry .
i don 't know nick it all sounds pretty far-@@ fetched .
nick you 're asking him to commit political suicide
oh well that 's better . digging up the vice president 's brother .
ly@@ le ly@@ le look we took intr@@ o to ci@@ v pro together remember ?
nick you filed an 11@@ th-@@ hour motion
you can 't adjust things around a bit ?
i know fir@@ sth@@ and these people will do whatever they can to frame lincoln for stead@@ man 's murder .
i 'll give you 15 minutes this afternoon that 's it .
he doesn 't even know what happened .
he 's your brother . he knows you .
i promised i would get him out of here
you don 't get a man 's hopes up like that and then just ...
and it wouldn 't take much to do it .
you owe me a ticket out of here pretty .
i 'm really sorry about your brother .
look i know you were counting on this so ...
for what it 's worth over the years
had to wait another three weeks while they reset the whole process .
so take sol@@ ace in the fact that your brother 's wait is over .
there 's a lot of protocol in killing a man .
a lot can happen in three weeks .
thanks .
but anything or anyone that could verify your story
i 'll reserve judgment for now . i 'll take your arguments into consideration
you get this a lot ?
and he shor@@ ted out the wire just by biting on it ?
i 'll be dam@@ ned .
yeah there 's another one right here in the box .
right after i notify the state and fill out the paperwork .
it 's a diap@@ er ?
you need to wear it .
good look huh ? it 's for the electricity .
i did everything i could .
last time i had my head sha@@ ved
bet me 40 bucks i wouldn 't shave it .
have you heard from ver@@ onica ?
is there any news on the appeal ?
this isn 't gonna happen .
let 's just share memories swap stories
all right .
you can 't go to the prison .
there will be cops everywhere .
what 's that ?
and in the dream it felt like we were older .
and when i woke i knew that today wasn 't going to be the end
i love you dad .
they say he takes a lot of them to him .
him him . and today he 's looking in tar@@ an@@ to .
what the fuck are you saying , t@@ ama ' ? it 's good fishing out here .
they invited me to audi@@ tion for sal@@ a , as well .
we 're here to see sal@@ a . i 'm her manager .
all right . i 'll wait out here .
s@@ onia , pat , then ... ? where are you ?
all right , 20 minutes .
unfortunately , you 're lacking two things , class and his acquaintance .
you 're throwing away your savings , sergio .
well , in that case , have some , relax .
so don 't get in the way . the girls love this old-fashioned stuff .
what did you hear ?
bravo ...
you know me ?
so i 've studied you a bit , from a distance .
in all these years , he has given us two things
what are you saying , san@@ tino ?
we 're talking seriously here .
and why don 't you fuck off ?
explain this a bit more .
you may control six national tv networks ,
people notice .
people get pis@@ sed off .
does it seems smart to you to go on tv and say ,
of course it 's true . you can think it , but you don 't say it .
his heart and prostate are wrecked , though he keeps using them ,
i 'm not going to p@@ iss on my career by promoting an arrogant cocaine ad@@ dict .
get the fuck off me , now . i will not cheat on my man .
what are you , 13 ?
you just have , dear !
and now people are going to p@@ iss on you .
where are you going ... . ?
some of my wishes have already come true .
yes ...
i mean , they 're totally incompetent !
i think you just need to be patient , you 'll be back in power soon .
just because your arm is hurting , you think it 's going to fall off !
oh , that 's a shame , you have to go back .
don 't speak about him like that , love .
most powerful man in italy , time is money .
did you check me out properly , love ?
this isn 't politics , this is pus@@ sy .
i don 't know anything , i understand .
well , that 's precisely what i want to talk to you about .
otherwise i 'll spend all my time trying to figure out who she is ,
by sight .
she 's two-@@ faced , sil@@ vio .
listen carefully , san@@ tino .
they 'll be kicked out the party and be@@ headed politically .
what is a salesman , sil@@ vio ?
but we 're not interested in that because it would only de@@ press us .
we 're interested in the other thing .
who is this ?
and does this seem to you the time to call people to sell an apartment ?
listen , i don 't have time to waste .
i don 't need an apartment .
the self-@@ serving laws you had passed to further your economic interests
and not because your politics are nothing more than populist propaganda
because i wanted to switch sides . that 's exactly the point !
what ?
oh , god , another one ! what did this one have to say ?
this is the reason i cannot side with you .
sil@@ vio , you hear how good she is ?
and she 's not just good , she 's beautiful .
bravo , fab@@ ri@@ z@@ io , but now you can take her back . you go as well , fab@@ ri@@ z@@ io .
come , dear .
din@@ o bu@@ zz@@ ati .
they 're all on holiday , who knows where ?
bring him the girls and i 'll convince him to help you .
you 'll end up being treated like shit .
they want you , not him .
there 's another thing , delicate and annoying .
no kisses , no hu@@ gs , no pat@@ s on the back ,
my electors like the way i behave with other heads of state .
what do they have against jokes ?
he was famous for his jokes .
he 's a crazy , sick man . that 's what he is .
remember what bor@@ bon@@ i said when she saw you in the theatre ?
not only were you no actress , but you were a b@@ im@@ bo , too ,
look what you became !
i built a financial and political empire .
you 've spent a lifetime telling us and yourself how brilliant you are !
it 's not true .
your skill as a businessman consists in having cheated your whole life .
what do you think every other businessman ,
let me tell you a truth
they 're all prepared either to go around obstacles or knock them down .
you 're just a child who 's afraid of dying .
you 're not good .
come back soon .
then you 'll be back soon .
why won 't they let me run this country the way i did my companies ?
i don 't understand it .
that you could be the richest man in the country ,
well , you never got off that cruise ship where we played as kids .
you know something ?
and i noticed ...
why don 't you try again , sil@@ vio ?
stell@@ a she was called .
just be yourself . no , i 'm going to be exactly what they want me to be .
a reliable or principal support ,
tell us more about yourself
of course .
my role models include my parents , which i know is cor@@ ny ,
we like that . we 'll have a decision in two weeks
bones of any kind ?
morning , me@@ gh@@ an miles .
hey , looking good , chuck rogers .
i just spoke to my source inside the network . and ?
the decision should come down today .
mad@@ eline , where are you go .. you 're in the middle for this !
are you done , or should ... ?
hello !
just go one at a time . do you want to go next ?
oh , what sweater should i wear ?
the mood swings .
high , low . you never know where you 're gonna go .
but i love you no matter what
i can smell it on you ! go take a shower , for christ 's sa@@ kes .
pan@@ cakes !
yes . will you eat anything ?
see , dam@@ on eats .
you 're not going to rehearsal on friday
i 've never heard you say that without a cross@@ bow in your hand .
think of all the stuff we could buy .
some toilet paper so we can stop using our bath mat .
caroline , you hold on to this
i mean , you really think she can keep a secret
if i know , i 'll spoil it .
neither did my mom , which is how i became
don 't let it slip .
okay .
that 's why i didn 't want to give it to her .
d@@ ang , he 's like the ben aff@@ lec@@ k of jail .
oh , my god . that 's terrible .
oh , look ! my dad 's opening the show .
steel bars on our balls
so we 're just gonna take a brief inter@@ mission ,
that was incredible , dad !
" shan@@ ks for nothing " ?
well , i would have gone with " it 's a prison riot . "
here 's your envelope ,
unless maybe it 's a good thing
all right , it 's just max and you .
listen , honey .
you can live on the upper east side
kit@@ ten , i know you better than anybody ,
she like tennis ?
what we do is fucking hard , alright ?
fuck .
that one ?
pay day , love ?
what did you just say ?
spoon . fork .
mum@@ my !
i had just made dinner
after dinner at our house ,
i had wine with dinner .
i know these questions may seem intrusive , mrs. collins ,
he was murdered .
it must be difficult for you .
yes , quite difficult .
what , with the fact that the police
and the trun@@ ks begin to slip and slide .
heap .
sleep !
you want to talk about endless patience ?
there are six seasons , dude .
no , no , no , the sixth season is great .
it 's a wild ride .
c@@ j , where are you going ?
what 's happening in chicago ?
are you guys going out ?
i barely made it to the age of eleven , before
look at him , he is pis@@ sing
even the teacher started doing it .
yeah , mam@@ ai he does that
it must be fate that the two of you should meet . "
he said you had a story that would make me believe in god .
as for god , i can only tell you my story .
fair enough .
pon@@ dic@@ her@@ ry
spectacle .
religion is darkness .
as a chil@@ ds he 'd had polio .
in the end , god didn 't save him .
my am@@ ma went to college
ur religion was the : only ink she had to her past .
it was a third there , ra@@ vi and i were terribly bored .
run into that church , and drink the holy water .
why would a god do that ?
d e@@ al@@ ul@@ se e o es s
if god is so perfect , and we are not
i came to faith through hindu@@ ism ,
god works in mysterious ways .
my arabic was never very good .
in performing " sal@@ ah , " the ground i touched became hol@@ ly ground ,
are you out of your mind ?
you just ignored everything i 've ever taught you ?
you think that tiger is your friend .
that tiger ... is not your friend .
nothing else .
you know what your father said about coming back here ?
i was
he said he 's sorry . you 'll just scare them for life .
but he 's just a boy .
and this is a lesson i do not want them ever to forget !
we are doing this for you and ra@@ vi .
vegetarian , please .
do you have anything ... no no no no no !
you don 't want grav@@ y ?
i am happy bud@@ dist .
i 'm sure , grav@@ y is not meat .
don 't worry .

the stress of traveling is not good for the animals ,
do we
hey . get rid of me !
it was a human tooth .
carni@@ vorous ? like a venus ely trap ?
the plants , the water and those pools , the very ground itself
i filled my stores with fresh water ,
and so i waited for his return .
no one has seen that floating island since .
and yet , if i hadn 't found those shores , i would have died .
even when god seemed to have abandoned me , he was watching .
and when i was beyond all hope of saving ,
by the time we reached the mexican shore ,
i was afraid that in two feet of water
it was warm and so@@ it ,
ii was so spent , i could hardly move .
the cook threw me a life buo@@ y and pull me aboard ,
ee ate a rat !
just a bru@@ te bad man .
it was a week later that he
here wasn 't anything i could do .
couldn 't look away
next day , i killed him .
jesus , dave ! your mom 's making ve@@ gan cra@@ p for dinner . i wanted meat !
the die never lie .
that would be hil@@ arious .
y not ? you make it sound like ..
when , exactly ?
it 's a shower night tonight , so lights out at 9 : 30 .
hey . nothing really . it 's just the usual .
herself .
" dishes . "
embarrassing me in front of my friends ?
barbara is reaching out , and that 's good .
why do you care ... loud or she 'll hear us talking .
okay .
he 's the only one .
giving birth
at least that 's what they liked to think .
but huge , of course .
giants have hair of living ice ,
mountain giants ba@@ the in the blood of children ,
they just like to watch . totally sket@@ chy .
even worse , though , tit@@ ans .
like greek myth stuff .
hold on . you need to see what we 're dealing with .
then why are you swe@@ ating ?
can 't compete with a baby deer .
we 're going to have to track it .
the giant killer .
h i could have seen those games .
anny said i could use the table .
has something to do with a charter i did in seattle .
and once that happens ,
that 's way too dangerous .
i can do this on my own ,
let 's see what we can discover about them .
they 're trying to get you out , and you don 't trust them ?
be wise and take advantage .
it 's not that simple .
the electrical lines are probably running underground
hey , lin@@ c .
i saw these fl@@ yers for migrant workers in colombia .
bus leaves today , okay ?
lin@@ c , uh i appreciate everything you 've done
when i was 15 , my cousin told me about a job that only lasts
i 'm in panama , i don 't speak the language
underground or not , i 'm going to be a dad , lin@@ c ,
he confirmed what you told me
please let me help you .
yes , colonel .
it 's just outside of the gate .
thank you for arranging this for us , colonel .
you know you can fix this electric problem ?
my men will shoot you in i back of the head
it will not only be his life that is lost .
no worries , colonel .
i 'll dig .
hey , come on , now , don 't be proud .
talking to mah@@ one .
help me down the road , right , mi@@ key ?
i 'm gave him the sho@@ vels . get him out .
i worked in the prison he broke out of .
and you know what i got ?
there 's nothing he can do .
that 's what i thought ,
go see for yourself .
trouble keeps finding you here in son@@ a , doesn 't it ?
there are rumors about that you are trying to trick me .
oh ? let 's hope for your sake that 's true .
but just@@ make sure .
relax . i 'll get you the money .
how are you holding up ?
good .
i 'm coming with you . stay here .
yeah , i know ; that 's the problem .
what kind of a man are you that just
i was just about to get a little trim .
you 're a real smart guy .
here .
how did you get it ?
yeah .
so what 's the next step ?
and i 'll keep you posted .
what do you think ?
unless you want to make the colonel happy .
now all we have
thank you .

i am a thief , and i 'm a real , real good one .
what do you need me for ?
i got all the clients , but , you know ,
you seem like a good kid , but you got the wrong idea .
you could take care of them girls a lot better

you took pictures of my lungs .
how long do i have ?
you need to come back in .
you just left , and we ..
you want to forget magic ?
i was going to sell that on e@@ bay .
you have the gift .
you 're the last person hor@@ v@@ ath saw with the gri@@ m@@ hold .
so unless you want him to turn you into a pig who just loves physics ,
all right . all right .
really ?
can you please put my dresser back ?
what are you .. oh , no .
what ?
here we go . all right . move .
fortunately , they 'll all be dead soon .
well , how do we do that ?
now , focus on control . set me down slow and steady .
i 'll be back shortly .
dave , get back here .
where is she ?
he hasn 't told you , has he ?
sweetheart , you 've put your faith in the wrong man .
you 're in love right now . i can see it in your eyes .
i wonder what would happen
you 'd be no better than the rest of us .
this polluted , dirty piece of earth ?
i 'm in the garment business , so i take that as a testament .
sadly , he had no children of his own .
so , you see , this place .... can do nothing for me .
why is that ?
i can see that
you gonna check on the new house ?
do you need anything else ?
i 'll be here to pick you up when you get out .
these men are co@@ wards .
and too stupid to think of anything else to do .
i 'm sorry ?
so , what is it that you 've done ?
my shift 's actually up , so ..
so , you 've done nothing ?
they wanted the $ 6,000 worth of fuel that was in it .
thirty to 33 are just about ready to go .
to try to help our business and the city .
so when you say that we 've ...
well , yes and no .
and because of that , i don 't really feel comfortable sitting here ..
so , you know , i can 't go into specifies right now ...
so next week we will be bringing a case against you .
but , i didn 't want to have this happen next week
you have your job to do .
and we will take advantage of every opportunity to prove that .
exactly .
caused by the drift of soft sil@@ t from the sides of the
what is that ?
it 's a fucking gun .
your youngest daughter found it in the bushes outside our front door .
look . it 's loaded . with the safety off
we 've just pushed it a little too far , that 's all .
we 're big enough now they even give a shit about us .
and start going through our set of books .
i 'll get into it .
i need you two to sit down with them . i set up a dinner .
i don 't anticipate a problem .
jesus . all right .
that these are dangerous times and we have to adapt .
not well .
t can see that .
what is there to understand
it 's not illegal if i say it isn 't .
safe and timely passage of goods and products
we need to close this deal .
we have to close on that property .
why do you want this so badly ?
no , no , no , no . i don 't mean the deposit .
have you ever thought about it ?
that place has just been sitting right across that fence moc@@ king me .
i-@@ i-i just meant everything

my husband 's an honorable man .
i think i know your father .
my husband is not my father .

or i guarantee ..
this was very dis@@ respectful .

ranging from fraud to tax evasion .
which led to a shoot out on the 59th street bridge .
so , i should start by thanking you ...
yeah , we didn 't expect him to react that way .
i 'm sorry .
it has been brought to our attention ..
it 's a possibility .
i 'll present it to him .
need more time .
i know our agreement doesn 't allow for that .
and i should say that we feel fairly certain ...
that the guys who are doing this
that might have something to do with it who are not here tonight , so .
thank you . that may be true .
but i don 't think it 's as bad as they 're saying it is .
got us three more days .

tony , i 'm gonna need you to focus .
as in , past tense .
sorry .
and when he worked , he talked about his great plan .
i 'd ask ..
and his answer was always the same .
so , where is he ?
earth became ground zero for a power surge
until two days ago ...
i was in a place called the quantum realm .
to get in there , you have to be incredibly small .
she was my ...
cap .
yeah , we do .
you know what ? give me a break , steve .
you said that we had one shot .
we shot it . it 's shot . six stones or nothing .
you 're repeating yourself ,
dude . come on !
you weren 't on board with the time he@@ ist .
you ruined the time he@@ ist .
yeah .
no , no , no , there 's no other options .
we 're not going anywhere else . we have one particle left .
that 's it . all right ? we use that ..
yeah , well , if we don 't try ...
i got it .
we have a potential breach .
they 're trying , ma 'am , but brad@@ dock 's unit

what is that ?
nick , there 's something else in his mouth ,
guys , i 'm gonna need some bigger tools .
you check the other one , will you ?
but these patterns are inconsistent with this bar@@ bed wire .
looks like somebody brought chains to the party .
they appear to have been made by the bar@@ bed wire .
self-@@ control wasn 't exercised
this is all my fault .
where they let anyone in .
i wanted them to see how happy we were .
this is a coven@@ s and clans convention .
mr. stewart ..

kur@@ t francis . he 's also in the system .
digestive enzymes .
yeah , kur@@ t francis .
of course ... a vampire .
so , what was a vampire
it induc@@ es vomiting .
why would he turn against one of his own ?
maybe michael started to see you for what you really are
julie .
i want a lawyer .
michael 's blood in kur@@ t 's car
so if kur@@ t and thomas h@@ acked off michael 's head ..
they should .
all it proves
if they only took one or two swings ,
yeah . yeah , another wolf .
i admit that a black cloak does lend a gentleman
it dra@@ gs along the ground and collects plenty of trace .
it 's a flowering herb that only grows above 2,500 feet
makes me wonder what else is up there .
we know that the chase ended
don 't , stop !
michael said he 'd seen me at the convention last year .
so he changed
you can 't be someone you 're not .
and that didn 't sit well with anyone .
too late ! no returns !
well , now we know , next time we go to the farmers ' market ,
can it wait until i put a ban@@ d-@@ aid on a goat bite ?
your buddy got mu@@ gged by some baby farm animals .
so what do you need help with ?
