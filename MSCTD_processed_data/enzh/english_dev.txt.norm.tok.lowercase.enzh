our mission ? take down marquez before he can locate the plans .
nsa believes he 's headed to berlin to meet with azar .

no worries at all , mate .
she 's given up on your whole pathetic act .
enough .
jack , you 're my brother .
are you done ?
what you 're talking about is a one-way street . you understand ?
she 's had fair warning .
so fuck her .
do you have that sort of cash just lying around ?
about . $ 250,000 .
and you just forgot about it ?
what are you talking about ? !
by the time i found it , we were already committed .
believe me , there is nothing convenient
i 'm sick and tired of having barely enough .
so should you .
maybe .
as long as we 're square .
or am i supposed to just take your word ?
i 'd have thought you 'd be glad to be rid of her .
despite what you think ,
well , you 've got a crazy way of showing it .
it 's gone .
alice .
whac
at the safety deposit box at the bank .
what time shall i come back tomorrow
jack , all this talk of booze has got me quite thirsty .

i 'm here on police business .
up on devil 's rocks road ?

over my dead body .

brice catledge , caroline 's brother ,
oh , rubbish .
well , this is the thing , i 'm embarrassed to say ,
i began to doubt my own clear thinking
olivia and i were all set to take a holiday ,
you 'll spend your whole time in your room practicing card tricks ,
but if this woman knows she 's being watched by the great wei ling soo ,
she 'll never know you 're wei ling soo .
don 't get angry with me , olivia . it won 't be for long
ever since our very first dinner ,
oh , it was simply a matter of logic and common sense .
jittle howard
oh , i couldn 't agree more .
oh , i am his friend . notice i use the singular .
george , caroline , stanley . how do you do ?
a great pleasure .
of course , george and caroline are the reason i 'm here .
when she fooled howard burkan ,
i don 't know if howard told you , her name is sophie baker .
no , i have not , but these sleazy fraudsters change identity every month .
ah , now , that says a lot . yeah .
caroline , you were next to her .
well , i looked for the usual devices , of course .
she 's promised to try and make contact with my father ,
there is , of course , no spirit world , and even if there were ,
and , uh , how long will you be staying with us , mister .
ah , have you told him about sophie ?
well , she gets these sensory impressions . and , what are they ?
her head vibrates ?
have you got a whiskey , brice ? i absolutely do .
about old girlfriends i 'd had ,
oh , of course . of course .
sophie sees all .
and , i 'm told she 's very pleasant to look at .
mother 's agreed to subsidize a foundation
oh , she 's nothing i haven 't seen before .
i want you to see her working
" i ... i get the impression of the orient . china . "
yes , it 's all very tantalizing
because there is no sixth sense .
uh , yes , i had a bath . i had a little nap .
well , no , not entirely . i had an unpleasant dream .
i dreamt i was being followed by a sinister chinese .
what do you think it means ? i don 't know .
what ? oh , i was just ..
come , stanley , let 's go to ... you look stunned .
and when i mentioned him ,
i once raised a real tiger , but we both have our tricks .
i ... i was just telling mr. pepperidge here
is it " pepperidge , " or " talmudge , " or " taplinger ? "
that 's because there 's nothing to find .
there is no metaphysical world .
i think mr. nietzsche has disposed of the god matter rather convincingly .
mmm .
what are you doing today ?
do you want to join us ?
why don 't you join me instead ?
she 's a remarkable woman .
actually , get to know one another better .
come on .
tell me , doesn 't it ever trouble your conscience
not if their hopes are false .
then you admit you 're a fraud ?
the missing toe .
where are you from ?
any other way , lies madness .
no , it 's quite the opposite .
oh , but think how embarrassing it would be for you .
is that why jenny dropped you ?
i see long , blonde hair .
yes , she had a lovely laugh .
ceo gets indicted for fraud.investors start losing money .
if i didn 't know burrows pulled that trigger ,
people have killed for a lot less .
whites don 't want you . blacks don 't want you .

i 'm sure you can understand my reluctance to discuss past patients .
i 'm not accustomed to making enquiries like this , but i ..
i can help him .
what did you treat him for ?
one was a condition called low latent inhibition .
people who suffer from low latent inhibition see everyday things like you or i do
the stem , the bulb , the bolts , even the washers inside .
other people 's brains
if someone with a low iq has low latent inhibition ,
he came to me with absolutely no sense of self-worth .
but with the low latent inhibition ,
he couldn 't shut it out .
i didn 't know all this about him .
i hope you don 't mind ,
from what i understand it 's in your nature too .
lot community work , lot charity work .
the man you 're talking about died the moment i stepped inside these walls .
ladies and gentlemen , united states secret service .
don 't you talk to your guy friends about sex ?
well , you don 't talk about
so you can do it with me .
ah , and yet you find inspiration in toothpaste .
that works for you ?
although , uh , kinda ... miranda 's been , uh ,
bailey ?
i knew it freaked her out , but i was away .
just apologize , we feel terrible ,
well , i could have edwards tell her .
even better .

no , i
baby nathan and all of his college potential ,
i apologize . i 'll be over here .
i don 't wanna date any woman !
i thought you were gonna talk her out of it .
you 're both putting me in the middle .
she doesn 't listen to anyone !
i 'm not a child she has to arrange daycare for !
this is .. it 's awful .
that can 't be the worst thing in the world .
you can 't ... replace her .
why ?
if we 're gonna do this thing , we gotta do it now .
it won 't be done for another six hours .
okay .
that 's not your lunch , sheldon ;
isn 't tomorrow your usual laundry night ?
if this one under-or over-softens ,
the alternative would be to think backwards .
so how 's amy ?
i might have to let her go .
i thought she was a highly evolved creature
we have to go outside .
oh , for crying out loud .
what kind of superhero says , " dibs on the red tights !

same as your house .
well , yeah , i might like them .
there 's one story that says that house is still standing
you got some kind of deed ?
what do you mean ?
this is the old highway where the flood took it out .
something big definitely came through here .
like it 's holding on , just for me .
now turn around and walk away .
we 're , uh , public land and survey .
who used to live here ?

i guess we 're going back to the car .
do not let go of my hand .
yeah .
or he knew what he was .
no , but ..
i 'm doing a search for the word sammael .
s-a-m-m-a-e-l . it 's a name from the bible .

it 's awesome .
we were just listening
you 're supposed to put them back in the sleeves immediately .
these are just things . he 'd want us to play them .
no , i guess he 's not .
it was going pretty well till we ran into you .
i 'm just giving you a hard time , that 's all .
fate conspired .
you know , believe it or not , before i ended up here ,
yeah .
but , you know , got married and had a kid , and ...
you guys are the best .
well , with all the new stuff i bought for work ,
but whatever .
that , believe it or not , is my prom dress .
my date would 've had to clean that up .
maybe we can have , like , a prom do-over .
we could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tuxedos .
okay , guys , trust me ,
yeah , let 's see .
hey , where 's bernadette ?
oh , yeah , i got that evite .
but then i saw carrie ,
this prom thing 's been a real roller coaster .
i-i could tell because her voice got so high ,
i 'm not the best at reading facial cues ,
bruce wayne doesn 't wear a clip-on .
his name is alfred , and , yes , he does .
what , are you sure ?
i thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien .
you didn 't want to .
and even i knew it was weird to hire somebody .
yes .
you 're gonna put alcohol in the punch ?
if you had ripped ieans and a leather jacket ,
oh , everything .
pointing out that kings aren 't elected .
and while you 're at it ,
you know , because ..
penny implied the same thing .
just relax , it 's a joke .
wow , you look amazing .
oh , it 's a scaly genital organ
excuse me .
and for your information , leonard ,
but to be fair , the twins were a real handful that day .
what 's going on ?
and there 's a great deal of pressure
all i said was you look handsome .
it 's not just that .
and i 'm not blind .
so , i met jeanie at your aunt gladys ' .
is this what i sound like when i talk about india ?
why would your mother have a problem with me and stuart ?
you worry about getting your ass back in that seat in time .
and the word " no " won 't be in my vocabulary .
in and out .
you know i can 't get into that .
i 've jumped through all your hoops .
do you want to sell the card to me or not ?
that 's a lot of secrets on a little piece of plastic .
and this is on the house .
the company will do anything to get it back .
the allies spent two and a half years ...
but on d-day it came down to a handful of men ..
to decide the fate of the world .
is even the best plan is only as good ..
ms : i have info on sara .
it 's good to see you .
i don 't know about that .
we 're working together against the company .
you kept your word to me .
why must you go after this man ?
where i come from , there 's something called a blood feud .
yes .
one too many times , as it turns out .
angelita .
he was an independent contractor .
he was assigned to retrieve scylla once it went missing .
it 's the company 's little black book .
what do you want from me ?
you know that , right ?
not do a day ?
all right . sara tancredi , last seen in panama .
maybe we 've got a deal .
then go find it yourself .
the u.s. government should have a little more reach ..
get me back to the land ' o cotton .
ready .
it has to stay that way ...
taking down the company sounds a little bit more than a two-man job , no ?
i thought you said , you couldn 't trust anybody .
all right , two of your cohorts ..
they 're both facing time .
good , let him sit there .
he was working with whistler .
okay ? whatever you need , i 'll provide .
yeah , the card has all the data on it .
i don 't know .
and we 've got to break into a building ...
simple enough .
how do you know our dad ?
your father was a good man .
look , i 've been going after the company for five years .
the plug was going to be pulled on the entire operation .
i convinced my superiors to give it one more chance .
well , when we go out there and risk our necks ..
no , no , no , lincoln .
some people still fight for this country .
you can look for sara , if she 's alive .
long before i get the chance . linc .
what are you talking about ?
and there are some things ...
know what i mean ?
you sure you don 't want a sedative ?
how do you feel ?
look , i don 't know how we 're gonna take them down .
but i do know one thing ...
but you can guarantee it 'll be the federal , supremax .
call me when they are dead .
as it turns out , men who have escaped not one ..
and stay off the company 's radar .
we 've provided cell phones , clothing , and toiletries .
you patted these guys down before you let them in , right ?
his suit , you don 't buy a suit like that ..
that means he 's full-time .
you ask our friend mr. self to run tax records .
in los angeles drawing a military pension ..
and you narrow your field from 10 million till about 50 .
find the driver , you find the cardholder .
we haven 't ate or drank anything for days .
we ain 't gonna die , sancho .
tell you what .
travel at night when it 's cooler .
what are we gonna do when we get there ?
you mean after michael pays ..
will only last so long .
i mean , then what if somebody finds out we 're not .
if the card , this scylla is so important .
well , according to public records .
and he 's a ceo of a company called spectroleum .
and we gotta get this thing ..
so even if he 's got it on him , how do we get it off him ?
you copy it .
copying it will make it harder .
you have to return it , genius .
what 's that ?
oh , yeah , yeah , no .
i invented this
a digital black hole .
within ten feet of it .
like the account info ..
like the pin number of any credit card used at a gas pump .
and financial statements of ten people in ten minutes ...
and the information embedded in scylla ?
it 's ours .
just a matter of whether you do it before or after ..
tell me where the company keeps the box , jasper .
somebody does .
somebody that you might have access to .
your government job won 't protect you .
if i don 't find something to eat soon .
we 're not gonna make it .
keep our brains focused on something other than ..
come on .
i 'm hungry , teddy .
when one of us could help the other one survive ?
i 'll make it quick . i promise !
why 'd you have to go and do something sos
look , there 's no way we 're getting ...
i know .
we 're not .
what 're you reading ?
i can never find a good bag .
i should probably go ahead and just invest ..
yeah , that 's why i love this bag .
do you mind if i take a look ?
thanks .
you all right , mister ?
hello , i 'm from the alarm company .
strange signals from your property .
make sure all the contacts are still active .
yes , ma 'am .
okay , hold on .
yeah .
someone posted their bail .
i 'm showing a bruce bennett .
you think it fell out ?
you think we got the thing copied ?
without downloading the device , but ..
then , yeah , i think we got it .
where the hell is it ?
that 's why the maid went back inside .
assumed it belonged to her boss .
well , then guess what , fellas , it 's game over .
it took me to make that thing , michael ?
losing it is not the problem .
if they find out someone was after that card , we 're done .
does that mean we 're gonna go back to prison ?
means we go in and get it .
but i gather we don 't have that kind of time .
look , if you want us to get that device out of there .
give us some extra help .
which given the covert nature of this operation .
then you 're asking for the impossible .
i 'm not the one who put the entire mission ...
look , if the company finds that copy of scylla before we do .
they 're gonna find out who was behind it .
what if our father after everything he discovered ..
what if that 's what he finally realized ?
about dad was the back of his head .
always running from something .
but the one thing he never ran away from ..
and we got an opportunity to do that .
man , this ain 't fox river .
remember that .
of the u.s. penitentiary in livingston , texas .
there are still 105 inmates there .
someone is playing a shell game , bruce .
i have no criminal jurisdiction over .
i know you 've been in contact with sara tancredi .
wanted to talk some more about what happened in panama
because you 're a little like me .
so , um !
i 'm here .
but i also knew that if anything happened to me .
you would spend the rest of your life punishing yourself for it .
so can we make a deal right now that we 're even .
if we 're gonna be together .
or-or even that we should be .
i just want to start over .
okay .
also , all electronic devices must be turned off at this time .
flight attendants , take your seats .
i crashed , went straight to bed .
engine instruments are in the green .
they 're just cousins .
the client 's gonna come over to the apartment at 4 : 00 .
gloria , we 're here to sell your apartment .
well , i-i tried to talk about it this morning ,
uh-huh , jim sorry .
well , excuse me , my , my job is just death .
60 hours a week ,
i gotta get back to work .
david ? david ?
i 'm back , doc .
you found a john doe in his 20s on the pavement near the strip ,
sweat on the body bag
about as often as they get up and walk away .
that 's from the liver stick puncture .
city bus pass . no particular route .
" stonewall 1 / 14 , day seven .
turn around and tell these guys
come on .
dmv facial recognition ?
you know , i considered calling the dmv .
maybe they recognize this guy .
neither john doe was in codis .
yeah , " zombie dna index system . "
the potassium and glucose levels are consistent with the living .
was dismissed by the scientific community .
rumor has it that dr. aden ,
he was banished by the university ,
all right , so our morgue zombie
is aden still around ?
and i was able to track down the address .
casino 's three miles further .
dr. aden .. uh ... we 'd like to speak with you .
we 're from the crime lab .
lying government bastards !
they claimed that all of my papers had been destroyed .
it was a good way to cut me out of the green and the glory .
i 'm sorry . where did you find this ?
do you recognize him ?
he 's obviously on an autopsy table .
.... arose .
re-animation ? this is getting more interesting .
not as easy as you might think , bringing back the dead .
treating the work as their own .
i had the ithaca of that most profound mystery within my sights .
but i saw the storm clouds gathering .
for those not wise enough to pull their sails in ,
it 's a dead man 's party .
how could they do this ?
if they 've given it to some health club ...
dude . you going to tell us what we 're taking ?
trust me , kurt .
it 's time to put your cameras on .
godspeed , alice .
maybe we can get access to max 's university email account ;
yeah .
blocking out all earthly stimuli .
to strip the self down
maybe the tank wasn 't his idea .
so , i snapped some infrared photos .
that 's one way to drown in just ten inches of water .
congratulations . you 're batting . 500 .
let me see your ekg .
your zombie from the strip was under the influence of a paralytic ,
i 'd be a flat-liner .
could this cocktail produce , in certain individuals ,
well , one of our young explorers killed the other .
there 's no fighting in the war room , dr. strangelove .
.... beyond our past journeys of the mind .
alice even plucked out the black ones .
a card from her mom 's funeral five months ago .
mom 's death took a toll .
stand back , sir .
we have two dead .
the notebook i found in alice katsu 's room
which means dr. aden wrote those notes recently .
the notebook was not among his archived papers .
from the doctor himself .
she initiated contact five months ago .
but aden is not exactly advertising on bus benches .
she kind of felt like mr . anonymous knew a little bit too much .
i was scanning through kurt dawson 's video
then this happens .
yeah , kurt 's receiver picked up a signal from another camera .
well , those are women 's shoes .
she must have been in close proximity to kurt ,
it 's hard to say . but check this out .
weather radar , off . landing gear , down .
battery power , auto . external power source connected .
flashlight , check . escape rope , check .
sichuan 8633 , you are identified .
when we get home , you 'd better catch up on your homework .
thank you !
sichuan 8633 , contact chengdu on 123.7 . goodbye .

this woman had no identification ,
i see you got the suit i sent over . you like it ?
well , get ready to do all sorts of shopping .
so where you going first ?
all i want is to go home .
you sound surprised .
no one would blame you if you hated them a little .
a little .
the neighbors were surprised to see him .
but he had thought about them .
the phone call that comes in the middle of the night ..
the e-mail marked " urgent ! .. "
it must be delivered in person .
you said this couple lives in your neighborhood .
and just what am i supposed to say ?
" by the way. one of our nurses
normally , i 'd give you a hug ,
god ! how am i gonna tell carlos ?
and he 'll probably find a way to blame me !
mom , we don 't have any clean plates .
he paid in advance , and he didn 't have pets . i didn 't care .
that maniac was serving a life sentence .
if you 'd like to come in for a while ,
come on now .
felicia tillman 's alive ?
i said that over and over again in my trial .
none of you could make it to the courthouses .
in our defense , we thought you were a cold-blooded killer .
i missed my friends .
i can 't believe paul young is back on wisteria lane .
jack !
actually , i need to talk to you and your wife .
i think we should wait for gaby .
you 're making me nervous .
no ! this is impossible .
we haven 't been able to track the family down yet .
carlos , i have a legal responsibility here .
fine ! i 'll do it .
this is going to destroy her .
why are we doing this ?
it 's so ... cozy and intimate and ...
pay attention , kids .
i hate banging around my lonely old barn of a house .
i 'm sure you see them on whipping day .
i worked on these compliments all the way from the airport .
mom .
you know , they set their own hours .
and oh , yoy , yoy , the money .
i 'll bet you 'd be real good at it .
come on .
here 's what martha makes in a week .
i promise , you won 't do anything
what are you looking at ?
nice of your physical therapist to help with the move .
let 's see . uh , i 'm getting a divorce .
i 've had better mondays .
don 't be .
we haven 't been happy for a long time .
i think i need to sit quietly
i know it 'll be spectacular .
hi , bree .
i just wanted to see how you were doing .
in fact , i took your advice .
i 'm surprised you agreed to see me .
i didn 't realize there 'd be glass .
give yourself time .
18 months with good behavior .
maybe i can give you a few pointers on prison life .
hey , here 's one .
i will see you behind bars again , or dead ...
here 's another pointer .
you murdered my sister .
i have to go now .
what was lynette like in college ?
she just kept wearing those parachute pants ,
before i met her ,
i 'd never even heard of gucci or prada ...
wow , you guys play rough .
a blouse from the " i 've stopped trying " collection
that 's great. easy shots . you got more money than me .
the lynette i knew never would have settled for this .
you jumped onstage at a springsteen concert .
who had a threesome with two of the guys
why would she jump in a private jet
we 're not talking about that anymore .
does she really need to score bonus points
oh , drop it , tom .
when she made that ... " aw , "
well , maybe you should tell her how you feel .
in fact , i am going to tell her a lot more than that .
and i won 't let anything change that .
i know it was a bit of a splurge ,
the bank turned down my loan application .
and without help ,
orson , don 't we have plans ?
why don 't you wait for me in the van ?
was it evolving while you and i were still together ?
that would be a hard no .
two mothers . only one gets the kid .
they are shooting everything down
we have less than 12 hours to try to settle .
we have richard webber .
gamble .
or else they both stand their ground .
and the kid gets torn apart .
mer will be down in a second .
please . it 's the best way to spend a day off .
with chocolate chips ?
damn it . uterus is perforated .
thank you .
this pregnancy has just become non-viable .
it 's only 24 weeks .
i can try .
" hope for the best ? "
five seconds ago , you wanted to deliver .
dr. karev , i am the ob on call here .
if i say that a patch is best , a patch is best .
if it keeps the baby in ,
prep albumin polymers , please .
how 'd it go ? how 's jenny ?
we located the source of the leak ,
the baby is healthy and still in utero ,
it wouldn 't be ideal .
it seems like i was just here
you built forts and it was really fun .
i don 't want to .
she woke up really early
it is a transcript of text messages
we have very flexible schedules .
dr. webber ?
she asked dr. torres to switch with her 34 times .
and that 's in addition to the previously mentioned
there are only 180 days in six months ' time ,
calls for speculation .
your honor , we 'd like to request a short recess .
don 't let them rattle you .
i mean , we just lost in there , right ?
hey !
it 's mine and i want it .
come on , let 's go . take me out of here .
osgood ?
god damn it !
i really do , you know , but there 's an animal side to everybody .
i was the one who dragged you out of there .
i 'm a licensed pilot , took karate in tokyo .
i can memorize the front pages
i 'm fluent in four languages
don 't interrupt me . there 's more .
yeah .
i 'm staying at caesars , mr. wild .
7 : 00 , mr. kinnick
how could you be such a bastard os , huh ?
that 's not an insult , that 's a fuckin ' insult
and you didn 't tell me you were gonna take my fuckin ' hair .
she likes you better without it .
who knew ? word to the wise .
i stay with her on account of our four kids and i can survive ,
fuck ! shh , he 's about to ask for a memory .
oh , she 'll lie down . she just doesn 't realize
so please , marie , leave me with the memory .
okay .
son of a bitch ! how does he get fucked every time ?
i use discs , actually .
you 've got to confront him with this . record his reaction .
i 'm in a tricky position here . i signed a confidentiality agreement .
and what if i don 't record any discs ?
then i 'll deny it .
frank is recording every word .
oh ! come on !
that i 'd come into a meeting with a man working for lang
you 're working for the good guys .
in the end , he 'll just retire over here with his cia pension ,
thank you .
well , let 's hope it 's not your last .
hey , bring my ghost a calvados .
do you mind ?
ruth said you were in new york to see maddox .
i 've never heard such utter balls in my entire life .
mike betrayed you to rycart .
he told me .
you think it was just one guy doing all that work ?
oh , jealous ?
i am .
well , at least we know brain surgery
you got to be more than 180 now .
excuse me , but thinking of you men in tights makes me want to ...
there 's a flu going around the hospital .
don 't push so hard .
claire. you 've had surgery recently .
don 't tell my parents .
what did you have done ?
come on , jamie .
oh , yeah .
just a little .
and the twitching has gotten worse ?
hunt them down if you can 't find them .
got the flu ?
it 's making my life so much easier .
you should be in bed .
seriously . i 'll give you a ride home .
you go home .
not as up close as meredith has .
she 's our friend .
some of us will make it through , and some of us won 't .
it 's not her fault , it 's shepherd 's .
he 's taking advantage of her .
okay , we 're in good shape here .
looks good .
hey , jamie , here 's what we 're gonna do .
isn 't that fun ?
and this is gonna feel cold .
butterfly lands right there .
it 's amazing stuff , isn 't it ?
yeah .
let 's go .
i 'm just concerned .
the internet .
yeah , i tried that , but
and how much have you been working out ?
everyone gains weight in college , mom .
l just thought if i wasn 't worried about my diet , then ...
so you took yet another shortcut ?
tina !
she has so much potential . if she would just apply herself
the condition has gotten radically worse
how soon ?
so , is there a cure ?
see , eventually , the spinal fluid will fill the cavity .
her age makes it possible .
but will she be normal ?
but if , you know , we 're successful ,
the important thing to remember is that we can save her life .
dr. o 'malley ?
but if the parents consent ,
uh , in .
yang .
get out ! i would kill for that .
it 's outrageous .
why do you hate him ?
you know about him and meredith ?
when are you gonna figure out that i know everything ?
i know .
this poor girl ...
she wants her mother 's approval .
and this damage is the result ?
well , getting proper nutrition will be a lifelong problem for claire .
as if we already don 't have our hands full with her .
she stays out of trouble .
i just think she feels like
you know , taylor , her anesthesia 's awful light .
dr. taylor ?
taylor !
oh , god , sorry . sorry , i 'm on it .
he was right , wasn 't he ?
whatever you got to do to get through the day , right ?
yes , doctor .
yeah , not in here , it won 't .
hopkins , take over until she gets here .
what happened ?
i wish them the best of luck .
it means i believe in the process
okay thank you very much warden .
thank you .
16 hours .
is there still a chance with that ? no .
i need to see my brother .
yeah . yeah . i 'll try .
i 'm sorry .
would you talk to your father for me
sara .. dr. tancredi i 'm sorry .
this isn 't about the morality of the death penalty .
this is about killing an innocent man
michael ,
i 'm sorry .
i don 't know nick it all sounds pretty far-fetched .
nick you 're asking him to commit political suicide
oh well that 's better . digging up the vice president 's brother .
lyle lyle look we took intro to civ pro together remember ?
nick you filed an 11th-hour motion
you can 't adjust things around a bit ?
i know firsthand these people will do whatever they can to frame lincoln for steadman 's murder .
i 'll give you 15 minutes this afternoon that 's it .
he doesn 't even know what happened .
he 's your brother . he knows you .
i promised i would get him out of here
you don 't get a man 's hopes up like that and then just ...
and it wouldn 't take much to do it .
you owe me a ticket out of here pretty .
i 'm really sorry about your brother .
look i know you were counting on this so ...
for what it 's worth over the years
had to wait another three weeks while they reset the whole process .
so take solace in the fact that your brother 's wait is over .
there 's a lot of protocol in killing a man .
a lot can happen in three weeks .
thanks .
but anything or anyone that could verify your story
i 'll reserve judgment for now . i 'll take your arguments into consideration
you get this a lot ?
and he shorted out the wire just by biting on it ?
i 'll be damned .
yeah there 's another one right here in the box .
right after i notify the state and fill out the paperwork .
it 's a diaper ?
you need to wear it .
good look huh ? it 's for the electricity .
i did everything i could .
last time i had my head shaved
bet me 40 bucks i wouldn 't shave it .
have you heard from veronica ?
is there any news on the appeal ?
this isn 't gonna happen .
let 's just share memories swap stories
all right .
you can 't go to the prison .
there will be cops everywhere .
what 's that ?
and in the dream it felt like we were older .
and when i woke i knew that today wasn 't going to be the end
i love you dad .
they say he takes a lot of them to him .
him him . and today he 's looking in taranto .
what the fuck are you saying , tama ' ? it 's good fishing out here .
they invited me to audition for sala , as well .
we 're here to see sala . i 'm her manager .
all right . i 'll wait out here .
sonia , pat , then ... ? where are you ?
all right , 20 minutes .
unfortunately , you 're lacking two things , class and his acquaintance .
you 're throwing away your savings , sergio .
well , in that case , have some , relax .
so don 't get in the way . the girls love this old-fashioned stuff .
what did you hear ?
bravo ...
you know me ?
so i 've studied you a bit , from a distance .
in all these years , he has given us two things
what are you saying , santino ?
we 're talking seriously here .
and why don 't you fuck off ?
explain this a bit more .
you may control six national tv networks ,
people notice .
people get pissed off .
does it seems smart to you to go on tv and say ,
of course it 's true . you can think it , but you don 't say it .
his heart and prostate are wrecked , though he keeps using them ,
i 'm not going to piss on my career by promoting an arrogant cocaine addict .
get the fuck off me , now . i will not cheat on my man .
what are you , 13 ?
you just have , dear !
and now people are going to piss on you .
where are you going ... . ?
some of my wishes have already come true .
yes ...
i mean , they 're totally incompetent !
i think you just need to be patient , you 'll be back in power soon .
just because your arm is hurting , you think it 's going to fall off !
oh , that 's a shame , you have to go back .
don 't speak about him like that , love .
most powerful man in italy , time is money .
did you check me out properly , love ?
this isn 't politics , this is pussy .
i don 't know anything , i understand .
well , that 's precisely what i want to talk to you about .
otherwise i 'll spend all my time trying to figure out who she is ,
by sight .
she 's two-faced , silvio .
listen carefully , santino .
they 'll be kicked out the party and beheaded politically .
what is a salesman , silvio ?
but we 're not interested in that because it would only depress us .
we 're interested in the other thing .
who is this ?
and does this seem to you the time to call people to sell an apartment ?
listen , i don 't have time to waste .
i don 't need an apartment .
the self-serving laws you had passed to further your economic interests
and not because your politics are nothing more than populist propaganda
because i wanted to switch sides . that 's exactly the point !
what ?
oh , god , another one ! what did this one have to say ?
this is the reason i cannot side with you .
silvio , you hear how good she is ?
and she 's not just good , she 's beautiful .
bravo , fabrizio , but now you can take her back . you go as well , fabrizio .
come , dear .
dino buzzati .
they 're all on holiday , who knows where ?
bring him the girls and i 'll convince him to help you .
you 'll end up being treated like shit .
they want you , not him .
there 's another thing , delicate and annoying .
no kisses , no hugs , no pats on the back ,
my electors like the way i behave with other heads of state .
what do they have against jokes ?
he was famous for his jokes .
he 's a crazy , sick man . that 's what he is .
remember what borboni said when she saw you in the theatre ?
not only were you no actress , but you were a bimbo , too ,
look what you became !
i built a financial and political empire .
you 've spent a lifetime telling us and yourself how brilliant you are !
it 's not true .
your skill as a businessman consists in having cheated your whole life .
what do you think every other businessman ,
let me tell you a truth
they 're all prepared either to go around obstacles or knock them down .
you 're just a child who 's afraid of dying .
you 're not good .
come back soon .
then you 'll be back soon .
why won 't they let me run this country the way i did my companies ?
i don 't understand it .
that you could be the richest man in the country ,
well , you never got off that cruise ship where we played as kids .
you know something ?
and i noticed ...
why don 't you try again , silvio ?
stella she was called .
just be yourself . no , i 'm going to be exactly what they want me to be .
a reliable or principal support ,
tell us more about yourself
of course .
my role models include my parents , which i know is corny ,
we like that . we 'll have a decision in two weeks
bones of any kind ?
morning , meghan miles .
hey , looking good , chuck rogers .
i just spoke to my source inside the network . and ?
the decision should come down today .
madeline , where are you go .. you 're in the middle for this !
are you done , or should ... ?
hello !
just go one at a time . do you want to go next ?
oh , what sweater should i wear ?
the mood swings .
high , low . you never know where you 're gonna go .
but i love you no matter what
i can smell it on you ! go take a shower , for christ 's sakes .
pancakes !
yes . will you eat anything ?
see , damon eats .
you 're not going to rehearsal on friday
i 've never heard you say that without a crossbow in your hand .
think of all the stuff we could buy .
some toilet paper so we can stop using our bath mat .
caroline , you hold on to this
i mean , you really think she can keep a secret
if i know , i 'll spoil it .
neither did my mom , which is how i became
don 't let it slip .
okay .
that 's why i didn 't want to give it to her .
dang , he 's like the ben affleck of jail .
oh , my god . that 's terrible .
oh , look ! my dad 's opening the show .
steel bars on our balls
so we 're just gonna take a brief intermission ,
that was incredible , dad !
" shanks for nothing " ?
well , i would have gone with " it 's a prison riot . "
here 's your envelope ,
unless maybe it 's a good thing
all right , it 's just max and you .
listen , honey .
you can live on the upper east side
kitten , i know you better than anybody ,
she like tennis ?
what we do is fucking hard , alright ?
fuck .
that one ?
pay day , love ?
what did you just say ?
spoon . fork .
mummy !
i had just made dinner
after dinner at our house ,
i had wine with dinner .
i know these questions may seem intrusive , mrs. collins ,
he was murdered .
it must be difficult for you .
yes , quite difficult .
what , with the fact that the police
and the trunks begin to slip and slide .
heap .
sleep !
you want to talk about endless patience ?
there are six seasons , dude .
no , no , no , the sixth season is great .
it 's a wild ride .
cj , where are you going ?
what 's happening in chicago ?
are you guys going out ?
i barely made it to the age of eleven , before
look at him , he is pissing
even the teacher started doing it .
yeah , mamai he does that
it must be fate that the two of you should meet . "
he said you had a story that would make me believe in god .
as for god , i can only tell you my story .
fair enough .
pondicherry
spectacle .
religion is darkness .
as a childs he 'd had polio .
in the end , god didn 't save him .
my amma went to college
ur religion was the : only ink she had to her past .
it was a third there , ravi and i were terribly bored .
run into that church , and drink the holy water .
why would a god do that ?
d ealulse e o es s
if god is so perfect , and we are not
i came to faith through hinduism ,
god works in mysterious ways .
my arabic was never very good .
in performing " salah , " the ground i touched became holly ground ,
are you out of your mind ?
you just ignored everything i 've ever taught you ?
you think that tiger is your friend .
that tiger ... is not your friend .
nothing else .
you know what your father said about coming back here ?
i was
he said he 's sorry . you 'll just scare them for life .
but he 's just a boy .
and this is a lesson i do not want them ever to forget !
we are doing this for you and ravi .
vegetarian , please .
do you have anything ... no no no no no !
you don 't want gravy ?
i am happy buddist .
i 'm sure , gravy is not meat .
don 't worry .
why give orange juice tranquilizers ?
the stress of traveling is not good for the animals ,
do we
hey . get rid of me !
it was a human tooth .
carnivorous ? like a venus ely trap ?
the plants , the water and those pools , the very ground itself
i filled my stores with fresh water ,
and so i waited for his return .
no one has seen that floating island since .
and yet , if i hadn 't found those shores , i would have died .
even when god seemed to have abandoned me , he was watching .
and when i was beyond all hope of saving ,
by the time we reached the mexican shore ,
i was afraid that in two feet of water
it was warm and soit ,
ii was so spent , i could hardly move .
the cook threw me a life buoy and pull me aboard ,
ee ate a rat !
just a brute bad man .
it was a week later that he
here wasn 't anything i could do .
couldn 't look away
next day , i killed him .
jesus , dave ! your mom 's making vegan crap for dinner . i wanted meat !
the die never lie .
that would be hilarious .
y not ? you make it sound like ..
when , exactly ?
it 's a shower night tonight , so lights out at 9 : 30 .
hey . nothing really . it 's just the usual .
herself .
" dishes . "
embarrassing me in front of my friends ?
barbara is reaching out , and that 's good .
why do you care ... loud or she 'll hear us talking .
okay .
he 's the only one .
giving birth
at least that 's what they liked to think .
but huge , of course .
giants have hair of living ice ,
mountain giants bathe in the blood of children ,
they just like to watch . totally sketchy .
even worse , though , titans .
like greek myth stuff .
hold on . you need to see what we 're dealing with .
then why are you sweating ?
can 't compete with a baby deer .
we 're going to have to track it .
the giant killer .
h i could have seen those games .
anny said i could use the table .
has something to do with a charter i did in seattle .
and once that happens ,
that 's way too dangerous .
i can do this on my own ,
let 's see what we can discover about them .
they 're trying to get you out , and you don 't trust them ?
be wise and take advantage .
it 's not that simple .
the electrical lines are probably running underground
hey , linc .
i saw these flyers for migrant workers in colombia .

i 'm sorry .
it has been brought to our attention ..
it 's a possibility .
i 'll present it to him .

i know our agreement doesn 't allow for that .
and i should say that we feel fairly certain ...

but i don 't think it 's as bad as they 're saying it is .

i would really love to observe if that 's cool with you .
now if you 'll excuse me ,
did you hear mer just revolutionized the world of cutlery ?
working on a liver model .
are you still going to try to remove all of the tumors today ?

he 's strong , able to fight . and what 's better ?
you should print a spoon next .
it is an anatomically correct liver model with a portal vein .

10 , maybe 12 hours .
it 's life-saving technology . shane .
it 's a fake organ . how long for functional items ?
like a pretzel .
good .
uh-huh . yay . japan .

just concentrate on one thing at a time .
then we move on to the next step .

if it turns out we can 't remove it ,
ah , you still have the ring .
um , yeah . we are .
i just out of a job interview
uh , we don 't do things like this at seattle pres .
because we do way too personal on a daily basis .
i can do it .
it might be better just to close him .
no blue .
let 's also get a bubble test .
we need to be absolutely sure that there 's no leak .
is that what you want for the patient , wilson ?
you know , bubble test only takes a second .
no , no , it 's a .. good exhausted .

good boy .
hey . let me ask you a question ..
all right . i need you to listen very carefully to what i 'm sayin'
here 's the deal .. you did not .
you got in trouble
i really don 't think that that 's the right thing to be teaching your kid .
so , the lesson you got to learn is this ..
you follow ?
punch people when no one 's looking .
if nobody sees it ..
well , look what crawled out of the gutter .
what happened ? i must 've been doing 30 in a 25 .
why don 't you do your fucking job
i 'm doing my fuckin ' job .
you wouldn 't happen to be carrying a message , now , would you ?
gerry angiulo sends his regards .
he also said he 's confident
fuck you !
i got to tell you something , officer flynn .
there 's a word for that back home , you know .
i never trusted flynn . he 's a fucking prick .
even as kids , he was a fuckin ' prick !
please , calm down .
i 'll fucking kill that flynn .
this is business .
you 're a liaison . you pretty much do whatever you want .
there 's just one restriction on our side ...
kevin , did you know that whitey was an informant ?
i mean , he hated rats .
i mean , i knew he had his connections in the fbi .
but i figured he was playing them like he did everybody else .
where do you get the energy for that shit , jimmy ?
we 've known each other a long fuckin ' time .
you know you can trust me .
the lottery , jimmy ?
i went in on a ticket as a lark ,
we were making a lot of money .
local street cops , feds , whatever .
and then there was those trips to miami .
fuck me .
an hour ago , i got a wet shave in a barbershop
do you want to talk about who 's a valuable asset , charles ?
and giving them 40 bucks to go around the corner
no one else .
like him giving up angiulo 's address at 98 prince street .
because it kept connolly , you know ...
we had stuff going on in florida .
roger ?
it 's an exciting time for jai alai ,
i can 't believe people pay to watch this shit .
they fucking love to bet on it . that 's making us very rich .
guy 's a fucking double-barreled prick .
oh , no , no , no . you give that to kevin , not me .
so , what 's the problem with this wheeler guy ? what 's his deal ?
what sign did i have that you could change , stoick ?
i pleaded so many times
this , and one other reason .
go on ,
could this day get any worse ?
we 're gonna jump into freezing cold water

now ...
i have .
i hadn 't thought about that .
hello , amy .
that 's not true !
this isn 't about me and sheldon .

when he was a co in fox river .
these are right , right ?
i don 't know . it looks too simple .

the two of you , go home .
omegas , good job .
kate , kate , kate , kate , kate .
i mean , if anyone 's hungry , they can eat

so , you think you can do better ?
the next girl that comes up the hill , she 's mine .
kate is hot .
hey .
humphrey , you know the rules .
we can eat together .

yeah . i 'm thinking about doing a little traveling ,
our old buddies , see how they 're doing .
wait . but you 're leaving jasper ?
i know humphrey , the fun-loving omega ,
i don 't doubt that .
did he give you any clues , any coordinates , anything ?
i had a vision . i didn 't wanna believe it .
tony , i 'm gonna need you to focus .
as in , past tense .
sorry .
and when he worked , he talked about his great plan .
i 'd ask ..
and his answer was always the same .
so , where is he ?
earth became ground zero for a power surge
until two days ago ...
i was in a place called the quantum realm .
to get in there , you have to be incredibly small .
she was my ...
cap .
yeah , we do .
you know what ? give me a break , steve .
you said that we had one shot .
we shot it . it 's shot . six stones or nothing .
you 're repeating yourself ,
dude . come on !
you weren 't on board with the time heist .
you ruined the time heist .
yeah .
no , no , no , there 's no other options .
we 're not going anywhere else . we have one particle left .
that 's it . all right ? we use that ..
yeah , well , if we don 't try ...
i got it .
we have a potential breach .
they 're trying , ma 'am , but braddock 's unit
i 'll look at the weather projections .
so , where you at with names ?
what is that ?
nick , there 's something else in his mouth ,
guys , i 'm gonna need some bigger tools .
you check the other one , will you ?
but these patterns are inconsistent with this barbed wire .
looks like somebody brought chains to the party .
they appear to have been made by the barbed wire .
self-control wasn 't exercised
this is all my fault .
where they let anyone in .
i wanted them to see how happy we were .
this is a covens and clans convention .
mr. stewart ..
miss crenshaw ?
in the movies , vampires thirst for blood .
no , but seriously , this might
heavy head , curved blade about five inches long .
none .
thank you .
uh , will you and detective vartann be
i had love in my grasp ,
i 'll ... keep that in mind .
his name 's timber .
timber , here , joined in on the fight .
blame the owner , not the wolf .
kurt francis . he 's also in the system .
digestive enzymes .
yeah , kurt francis .
of course ... a vampire .
so , what was a vampire
it induces vomiting .
why would he turn against one of his own ?
maybe michael started to see you for what you really are
julie .
i want a lawyer .
michael 's blood in kurt 's car
so if kurt and thomas hacked off michael 's head ..
they should .
all it proves
if they only took one or two swings ,
yeah . yeah , another wolf .
i admit that a black cloak does lend a gentleman
it drags along the ground and collects plenty of trace .
it 's a flowering herb that only grows above 2,500 feet
makes me wonder what else is up there .
we know that the chase ended
don 't , stop !
michael said he 'd seen me at the convention last year .
so he changed
you can 't be someone you 're not .
and that didn 't sit well with anyone .
too late ! no returns !
well , now we know , next time we go to the farmers ' market ,
can it wait until i put a band-aid on a goat bite ?
your buddy got mugged by some baby farm animals .
so what do you need help with ?
okay . were you talking before she got upset ?
that 's probably it .
well , i just asked her if i should start watching
well , sheldon , when you 're kissing a girl ,
yeah . i 'm tapping out . leonard ?
oh , no , not just a season .
i 'm sorry i 've upset you .
no , it 's okay .
well , look at that ..
hey , next , why don 't we tackle your penchant for whining
ah , well .. very well .
here we go again .
we 're committed to each other . we 're happy .
so you 're never getting married ?
it 's amusing that he doesn 't hear it .
ew , 50 ? we 'll be old and gross .
my aunt and uncle were married 63 years .
um .. i 'm free tonight .
vegas isn 't that far away .
after all these years .

and , howard , your favorite fruit is in season .
this is a new era for millennium .

don 't be a child .
plus , he 's wearing a cap .
he has over two million followers online .
what do you want from me ?
come by tonight .
erika .
she 'll be right with you .
i 'm guessing he thinks you stole this from him ,
why ?
he 's the only one who can open it .
i don 't really see how this makes her any less guilty .
you should be looking for this man , too .
now , if you will excuse me .
do you know this man ?
so are you a cop ?
i 'm a journalist .
heavy people .
mikael .
the first you couldn 't have written without her ,
i 'm sorry .
they sound like the last people on earth
what 's that ?
so i figure out the big number ,
you think i 'm a freak .
get some sleep .
stay in your cell !
salander .
tell me you got the boy .
i need you to get him back to the u.s .
no , no , no .
i won 't give it up now . think you have a choice ?
something somebody like you wouldn 't understand .
shit .
agree to take the kid back to the u.s. or it stays locked .
would you like a glass of water ?
he needs to open the program for us .
fuck you .
i will start with this one , the red one .
the black one , though
come on . this thing with julia is young and fragile .
i got us a table at campo 's .
i have plans .
and let 's page shepherd . quickly , please .
this isn 't a migraine , right ?
she 's having a seizure .
i stepped over a line . you reprimanded me .
