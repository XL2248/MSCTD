I &apos;m not happy about it either , ok@@ ay ? At all .
You &apos;re on admin leave until they make a determination on the battery ...
What do you mean ?
Rather than guard every project ,

This looks a lot like the same thing .
U@@ h ... . I don &apos;t know . The wife might &apos;ve done .
Ye@@ ah , all right , call me back .
Hop@@ efully . I &apos;m not allowed near it for now .

Package ?
Because the language of these people is fire , right ?
Not like we do .
Oh , come on , Se@@ an . Of course we do .
And the dragon loves to speak with us , and you know it .
You would be seeing another you .
All right , look , just level with me .
I don &apos;t know anything about a package .
But I will share a story with you ,
Listen to me , you son of a b@@ itch ,
Two guys walk into a building , one walks out .
So , I grab@@ bed a gar@@ dener &apos;s can of mixed fuel ,

J@@ ason , don &apos;t worry about what you &apos;re seeing on TV .
Come on , we &apos;re gon@@ na be late .
Have a good day
Morning .
Who would drop a package off looking like that ?
Those research mon@@ key guys ?
Wo@@ w . It just gets better .
Let &apos;s see what brought you in here today .
It &apos;s not just a sp@@ le@@ en , it &apos;s ...

Not really the p@@ un type , Jahr@@ ling .
Rom@@ eo , Bra@@ vo , Lima , Fort .
Ma &apos;@@ am , are you all right ?
Just check the g@@ love .
The cut was there before , but I ..
What the hell were you thinking ?
Why &apos;d you go in there with a cut ?
You can get as angry as you want at me later ,
No , because I was using a fresh sample .
I mean , how can you be 100 % sure ?
Col@@ onel , weeks ago , I asked H@@ az@@ let@@ on to send me samples
The cells ble@@ w up because they were infected .
What , you really think Coc@@ o J@@ r .
Look , what &apos;s more likely ?
That &apos;s reck@@ less .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m the only one
E@@ bol@@ a ?
I &apos;m gon@@ na need un@@ equ@@ i@@ voc@@ al proof .
I just need to get back in there .
It &apos;s protocol .
The patient is a 14-@@ year-old male ...
Four@@ th day back , and I &apos;m already sc@@ rub@@ bing in
Ye@@ ah .
I would , but I have to enter@@ tain all of them .

Of course , now my mo@@ m &apos;s convinced that Step@@ han@@ ie
You know what the worst part is ?
Well , so then you need to tell your mo@@ m that .

Nothing .
You know , you got@@ ta stay still . Let the whole fr@@ enz@@ y die down .

What do you want ?
Yang told me to discharge him .
S@@ ay it
But when I come back ,
I can come back later .
They &apos;re all in love with you , and afraid of you .
I mean , you pull your str@@ ings
You said that you would go .
That &apos;s against my policy . That &apos;s how you screw up .
That &apos;s how you lose your home ..
Look , you &apos;re a sweet k@@ id ,
All right ?
Ok@@ ay@@ . got that closed up .
I don &apos;t see anything .
All right , let &apos;s take a look at this penis , shall we ?

Ye@@ ah , he &apos;ll be able to stick it in a hor@@ net &apos;s nest ,
Well , I find that men often put their pen@@ ises
I &apos;m thinking about the patient .
Does she have a conc@@ ussion ?
You &apos;re gon@@ na be wor@@ ried about that
Dr. B@@ ail@@ ey knows the procedure .
Sorry .
Your .. white blood cell count is elev@@ ated .
Why do I need antibio@@ tics ?
You need to examine me
After I put you in the c@@ ab ,
And good thing , because you were passed out
And you insi@@ sted on having a dance party .

I expect you and your people are wondering
Well , you better give it some thought .

Maybe you were ..
Well , take your time . Sett@@ le in .
There &apos;s a snow le@@ op@@ ard .
So we have to try to be very , very , very , very still .
Beautiful things don &apos;t ask for attention .
I &apos;m taking a lot of heat over it at work .
The last roll you &apos;re talking about ?
Why am I sitting on it ?
That was the gift .
The wal@@ let was just something I could put it in .
I thought it would be cute .
Ye@@ ah ? Well , you got a real nice surprise coming
What the hell were you thinking ?
but that is not a good move , at all , with a valuable negative .
I thought it would be a play@@ ful kind of thing .
To@@ o play@@ ful
what did you do with the wal@@ let ?
Well , that hur@@ ts my feelings .
I appreciated it very much .
So , you have no idea what it was ?
It &apos;s a sh@@ ame .

Yang
I don &apos;t know how he got there .
Ro@@ y , your whole crew &apos;s in the waiting room .
Tell him i &apos;m sor@@ ry@@ . tell him i &apos;m so sorry .
The k@@ id in trau@@ ma 2 .
Of course i can , i just ... i was having trouble .
I mean , i couldn &apos;t tube her either .
There &apos;s too much sw@@ elling in the air@@ way .
6-@@ 0@@ . here you go .
U@@ h , hit the car@@ oti@@ d . H@@ it the car@@ oti@@ d .
Did you give blood today , d@@ r . K@@ are@@ v ?

Case in point .
Wa@@ it , wait .
So what was the problem ?
I came back from seeing the fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ter off to surgery .
You know , make a show of support .
And there was a problem ,
H@@ ey , can you give me a hand ?
I got her lab@@ s . I was sho@@ cked .
April k@@ ep@@ ner ?
Wa@@ it a second@@ . what the hell ?
What the hell ?
We &apos;re already filling her with flu@@ ids .
They needed more hands .
Not until she is more stable .
There was so much sw@@ elling , we couldn &apos;t find good v@@ eins .
We can &apos;t use the hyper@@ b@@ ari@@ c chamber Until she &apos;s stable .
Open up , please .
Ok@@ ay@@ . um , you look good .
But the one on your cal@@ f might be third-@@ degree .
You didn &apos;t look in her thro@@ at ,
O@@ h. where &apos;s your m@@ omm@@ y , p@@ al ?
When we &apos;re headed toward an outcome
It &apos;s not the doctors , Richard .
I know that .
For J@@ enn@@ ings , it was about legal .
I needed to know who finally was responsible .
S@@ ay it , Der@@ ek .
Maybe it &apos;s too many doctors ..
When I got to that room ...
Because that &apos;s the system now ..
Ob@@ s@@ essed with restor@@ ing natural order .
Titan DNA .
Are you kid@@ ding , Mart@@ ine@@ z ?
At 0@@ 500 , we &apos;ll ship out to launch a joint operation ...
Exc@@ use me ?
U@@ h , Mark , why don &apos;t we let Col@@ onel Fo@@ ster finish ..
Look , they &apos;ve already got Emma and the OR@@ CA .
The mass ext@@ inc@@ tion we fear@@ ed has already begun .
We are the infection .
Its original and righ@@ t@@ ful rul@@ ers ,
A way to protect the planet , to maintain its balance .
And within our lifetime , our planet will per@@ ish ,
And what &apos;s gon@@ na be left , if you do this ?
No , Doctor St@@ anton ,
I &apos;m gu@@ essing you weren &apos;t exp@@ ecting these guys .
all under attack .
Now as before , we have been trying to l@@ ure
Can you track him ?
But maybe she can .
Why ?
This category six hur@@ ri@@ cane over D.@@ C .
Working with all four branches of the military ,
What do those ner@@ ds think they &apos;re gon@@ na do
They w@@ anna bring Go@@ d@@ z@@ illa back from the dead .
App@@ reci@@ ate it .
The greater Boston area
I repeat , all citizens
And with D.@@ C. hit hard by a category six hur@@ ri@@ cane
And though this sight is hear@@ t@@ breaking ,
Why ?
That &apos;s how she made the signal for the OR@@ CA .
Well , that makes sense .
Ye@@ ah , that &apos;s real po@@ etic . Now what ?
What about Mo@@ e , Lar@@ ry , and Cur@@ ly over here ?
Oh , boy . Go@@ d@@ z@@ illa &apos;s radiation levels
What do you mean ?
Ok@@ ay , guys , you need to find the OR@@ CA ,
I &apos;m impressed .
Oh , spoke too soon .
Where did you get this ?
Take a look at the contract ?
All that &apos;s left is your signature , and we &apos;re good to go .
Perfect . Now you &apos;re officially a dis@@ cip@@ le of God &apos;s Pro@@ mis@@ e .
Who@@ o !
No , you don &apos;t .
I want you to leave .
No , I didn &apos;t .
You can start by putting
Yes , you did .
No , just ..
Did you ?
Change will come through God
I &apos;ve always known I didn &apos;t want to act
What ?
Who asked you ?
I mean , just imagine you &apos;re all sitting at a table together
What ? Why are you laugh@@ ing ? You know I &apos;m right .
I mean , the system is working on you .
O@@ oo@@ h
A little pec@@ uli@@ ar
And I say , &quot; H@@ ey , y@@ e@@ ah , y@@ e@@ ah , y@@ e@@ ah &quot;
Jam@@ ie , I ..
&quot; You already had this thing in you , but I didn &apos;t .
What if she &apos;s right ..
What the fu@@ ck ?
I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;m fine .
I don &apos;t remember , ok@@ ay ? It was sc@@ ary .
Let &apos;s go ! Let &apos;s go , baby . Let &apos;s o !
Don &apos;t drop that guard ! S@@ it .
Keep your hands up !
Come on , D !
Whe@@ el@@ er &apos;s power just isn &apos;t the same , and no doubt Cre@@ ed can sense it .
Cre@@ ed &apos;s on a mission , really pressing the issue now .
Cre@@ ed staying in the pocket , Max . Mo@@ ving , not running .
These two men are really going at it .
Another left h@@ ook drives Whe@@ el@@ er back .
A@@ in &apos;t nothing personal .
Call it whatever you want .
The money is a side effect .
Som@@ ebo@@ dy had to make it happen .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah , that &apos;s supposed to be you , hu@@ h ?
I want the same thing you want .
In the history of bo@@ xing ,
But how many do you think they know ?
Five ?
You need a narr@@ ative . Some@@ thing that sticks to the ri@@ bs .
Cre@@ ed clearly in pain , as he finds a way to his feet .
I don &apos;t know . This is getting dangerous , Jim .
And now , Bay@@ less is gon@@ na let him go again .
Box !
Hu@@ ge right h@@ ook !
And Cre@@ ed delivers a big right hand at the bell .
Bay@@ less re@@ stra@@ ining Dra@@ go , se@@ em@@ ingly fru@@ str@@ ated ..
You gon@@ na counter with the right
He &apos;ll never expect it . His old man did the same thing to me .
I think Cre@@ ed is with@@ standing Dra@@ go &apos;s combinations
And round two begins .
And a big right hand .
Ok@@ ay , can I just point out that &quot; technically &quot; I didn &apos;t di@@ so@@ bey you ?
You said go to the store after school , and I stopped by .
Ye@@ ah , see ? I didn &apos;t di@@ so@@ bey you . I just took a brief , educational det@@ our !
The way you &apos;ve been like a mother to Or@@ ph@@ an
You &apos;ll still look after us though , right ?
Sh@@ h , come on now , don &apos;t worry .
All of you are my family .
And then when my bab@@ ies are big enough , they &apos;ll protect you , too .
They are as wei@@ rd looking as Or@@ ph@@ an is .
And they &apos;ll grow up big and strong , like their mother .
All right , all right .
J@@ ules , come on , we &apos;ll just stay for a little while .
.... and M@@ om will never know we were gone !
This isn &apos;t about getting away with something , Er@@ nie !
Max , how do you get this to work
Well , first you run the initi@@ alization sequence .
What if it fell off while we were going back in time ?
Let &apos;s eat them now
If we don &apos;t reloc@@ ate soon , we won &apos;t have a choice .
Soon , nothing in the Lower Valley will survive .
So you better have brought us some good news ,
News you can use .
More adop@@ tions ?
And it looks like there &apos;s another egg still in her nest !
If it was taken , she &apos;d come look for it .
My bab@@ ies &apos; first night of life .
Like something &apos;s been checking it out .
J@@ ules , come here !
Come on ! Let &apos;s follow them .
Well , I want to see where these tracks lead to .
Fl@@ et@@ cher will never know it was you who spoke up .
Do you think that I would let him put my son through hell
That there is nothing in the world more important to me than you ?
Andrew
I saw that .
and he &apos;s laugh@@ ed off-@@ stage
And he practices and he practices , with one goal in mind
And he steps up on that stage and he plays the
&quot; Well that &apos;s ok , Charlie
But that &apos;s just what the world wants now .
Every St@@ arb@@ u@@ cks &apos; Jazz album Just proved my point , really .
You know maybe .. you go to far , you dis@@ courage next
Because the next Charlie Park@@ er would never be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
I never really had a Charlie Park@@ er .
And that &apos;s more than most people ever do .
Al@@ right , see you later .
Listen , I have no idea how you gon@@ na take this , but
then I &apos;ll find you an enemy in a new country .
Sir ... I often get this feeling that

So you want to spend some time with Professor K@@ id@@ wa@@ i ?

But I can &apos;t promise anything .
Just the way you like it , Sir .
And here &apos;s the ch@@ equ@@ e .
I hope you don &apos;t mind if I leave you alone with your p@@ unc@@ tured eggs .
You pay the bill .... . why should I ?
Man@@ ish Ch@@ and@@ ra ... . isn &apos;t that a bor@@ ing name ?
should sound like a dec@@ ent guy ... right ?
Ok@@ ay &apos; dec@@ ent guy &apos; , listen ...

The most important thing for an agent is ...
The day you follow your heart , consider yourself dead .
Hon@@ est@@ ly , I want to convey something to your daughter
Man@@ ish
I need a drink .
Can &apos;t people like us fall in love ?
When are we not on a mission ?
Mission !
and now everyone calls me that .
I war@@ ned you .. in an attempt to wo@@ o her
Should I tell you something ..
It &apos;s five in the mor@@ n@@ ing@@ . get some sleep ...
Sorry ...
In ten minutes you &apos;ve destroyed half of Dublin ...
What else could I have done in that situation ?
Not just him ... the whole town will know you &apos;re not a writer .
M@@ ust be watching the play .. what else ?
so let &apos;s create our own world ..
You have gone mad ... don &apos;t talk non@@ sense .
we cannot wait for them end@@ lessly .
Tiger ...
Hello ... Zo@@ ya , are you there ?
Please hur@@ ry and come down .
Sir ... I think he &apos;s been kid@@ n@@ apped by the Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ is .
He &apos;s too good for them .
Ok@@ ay , Sir .
Take the next flight from London and get here .
How much ?
47 thousand dollars ?
Should be 2.3 million ..
Tiger has not been kid@@ n@@ apped !
how much classified information Tiger has about our organisation ?
it will compromise the security of our agents all over the world .
but he will never give away that kind of information whilst he &apos;s alive ...
Sir ...
a Pak@@ ist@@ ani deleg@@ ate is also missing since this morning .
This is the address of the hotel .
This hotel belongs to his friend .
How long will you take ?
Sir .... . this is Zo@@ ya .
Sir ?
and bloo@@ dy Tiger could find a girl only from Pakistan ?
Meeting like this can der@@ ail the whole plan .
he is an extremely dangerous agent .
It &apos;s not that easy to tri@@ ck him .
but we must know what you are up to and where exactly are you ?
but to get him to you here is too ris@@ ky .
for once I followed my heart .
I &apos;m am@@ used at the thought of what will happen in Kaz@@ akh@@ stan now .
See there . . in that car .
Pak@@ ist@@ ani go@@ ons ..
Sir ... it &apos;s been close to four hours since the Istanbul flight land@@ ed ..
Al@@ right ...
No one arrived there today .
One to London and the other to Frankfurt .
Sir .... there are 6@@ 23 flights at London
and those two could be traveling on a passport of any nation@@ ality ...
keep searching ... we have to find them .
if Tiger has decided ... then it will be very difficult to find him .
RA@@ W was functioning before him ..
En@@ ough !
Five minutes are more than enough ..
So , G@@ op@@ i .... you want me to be shot ?
What have I done ?
Tiger , do you know how many countries there are in the world ?
Re@@ ally ?
Call her .. let &apos;s leave .
Why ? You just told me that she &apos;s ready .
Who are they ?
So let me get this straight ..
why .... to kid@@ n@@ ap a girl ?
The same girl was your si@@ ster@@ -in-@@ law in Dublin ...
you dem@@ oted her from si@@ ster@@ -in-@@ law to just a girl ?
H@@ ey cav@@ eman ...
Tiger ... Tiger ... Tiger ...
That &apos;s the plan ... Tok@@ as , you will be here .
You , cav@@ eman .... . you got an entire army just to catch me ?
One last time .. you &apos;ll be here .
Our flight will take off in two hours ...
You know what ? You got three coming in .
Any@@ body in here ?
Your three guests are coming out of the door behind you right now .
Oh , Z@@ inger .
I thought they were chocolate spr@@ inkl@@ es which I would eat normally .
Like a rat sau@@ ce .
Look . Unfortunately there &apos;s ver@@ min in the ceiling again .
Bur@@ ger King was booked up .
Guard your fruit !
Never as funny as you , Super Co@@ oper .
It &apos;s not pink eye , ma &apos;@@ am .
Well , I &apos;m aller@@ gic to dis@@ gu@@ sting childhood illness .
Sorry .
After Bo@@ y@@ an@@ ov &apos;s death ,
What do we know about her ?
Oh , that &apos;s stuck .
I &apos;ll pull up my file .
Why don &apos;t you just cry directly into my mouth while you &apos;re at it .
It &apos;s quite but@@ tery .
That was mine !
No , it &apos;s not .
I &apos;ve not been in a real relationship since Jer@@ ry left me three years ago
I thought everything is going to be different .
H@@ ey , you two cu@@ ties sitting here being all cute .
His service is really slow .
You &apos;re not getting that in the next hour .
Any sign of her in the house ?
There &apos;s some kind of inter@@ ference .
I &apos;m up for the challenge .
Sh@@ oot . There is something wrong with your camera .
To@@ o late
P@@ ull back , Fine , this is too easy .
Oh my god , Fine .
H@@ ey . Who &apos;s the finest of them all ?
Dro@@ p your weapon .
Let me gu@@ ess , wh@@ o@@ ever is in your ear wants to know what &apos;s happening ?
We need someone to follow De Lu@@ ca without being detected .
But it can &apos;t be any of you
Get a whole new face .
Do you have quarters ? C@@ ause it cost 50 c@@ ents .
No , because it doesn &apos;t exist !
I &apos;m pretty sure that they &apos;re pul@@ ling your leg
Jesus , look .
Do@@ esn &apos;t matter if we &apos;ve been exposed .
Gu@@ ys . This is more than just a kill mission .
We just need someone who could shadow them without attrac@@ ting attention .
Ms. Cro@@ cker , I would really like to do this .
I don &apos;t have any cats !
Look here , Bet@@ ty .
Not only did I become a citizen and take a v@@ ow to protect this country .
H@@ o , I didn &apos;t . Not me .
I remember it .
If you think , I &apos;m going to sit by
It &apos;s amazing . That is really super cool .
Wo@@ w . That is quite an image to be carrying all over Europe .
Why not , just make it look like pepper spray .
I wouldn &apos;t know . I don &apos;t have that problem .
If you ever feel like you &apos;ve been po@@ is@@ oned .
Have I done something to you , to up@@ set you or
Every agent gets a night vision scope hidden in their watch .
That is Bet@@ te Mid@@ ler and Barbara Her@@ sh@@ ey .
I would imagine a lot if you have the watch .
Anthony .

U@@ h ... I got to go war@@ n him .
Look out ! I got to get through !
Get out of the way ! Let me through , I &apos;m sick !
That would get me out of your way for sure .
Get out of his way !

Location is officially noted
I &apos;m doing this for Fine .
Come on , not the ho@@ ur@@ glass .

His GPS should tell you exactly where De Lu@@ ca is in Rome right now .
For@@ get it Co@@ oper . You &apos;re coming back immediately .
And I &apos;m not one to t@@ oot my own horn , but
We &apos;re so close in getting Ra@@ yn@@ a and that bom@@ b .
You &apos;ll be given a new identity .
Oh ! No !
Is that even legal ?
tha &apos; s be a business@@ man
Just missing the shirt that says I &apos;ve never felt the touch of a man .
You did good work back there .
Thank you ma &apos;@@ am .
It was already in the floor .
He &apos;s been at the Maj@@ estic hotel ,
I like to play the od@@ ds .
Here is my phone number
Do I have something for you ?
I not that .
You &apos;re supp@@ ose to have an en@@ vel@@ ope with my gun in it .
I am just ar@@ ouse from looking you .
They said you would no longer be ne@@ eding one .
Good grav@@ y . Was Pep@@ e Le Pe@@ w not available ?
You &apos;re getting more actions than I had in days .
Do you have an update on De Lu@@ ca ? ?
G@@ h , WO@@ W . He is ho .
I &apos;m not going to lie to you . I don &apos;t think I can be objective anymore .
I &apos;m jo@@ king Sus@@ an , don &apos;t report me .
Let &apos;s set up camp in the pa@@ stry shop behind you .
I &apos;m going in , N@@ ancy .
Track and report . No contact .
And if he initi@@ ate contacts with me ,
That &apos;s right . F@@ enny Morgan is gon@@ na burn her cat T-@@ shirt
You guys are terrible .
And they &apos;re not going to rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se you for that .
Ok@@ ay . I &apos;m going offline , N@@ ancy .
Two , three .
Cand@@ y ?
She &apos;s terrible .
E@@ ver notice how my sister &apos;s a jer@@ k ?
You know , &quot; Let him be happy &quot; ? What about me , you know ?
How I &apos;ll feel , you know ?
You know , starting up new families
But I don &apos;t have to teach him what to care .
I don &apos;t know .
That &apos;s ok@@ ay .
Those , u@@ h , pe@@ an@@ ut butter c@@ ups got me no@@ where .
Gu@@ ess you over@@ estimated that A@@ very sp@@ ark@@ le , hu@@ h ?
I think it &apos;s right that you continue her work .
l want a house
You could paint it any color
I was star@@ ing at Mount Everest , and I was ready to climb .
So , my legs were on his shoul@@ ders .
And my feet were , like , way up in the air ,
Oh , my God , it was so worth it , until
Then her legs .. sn@@ apped .
It was terrible !
Ok@@ ay , her pain &apos;s still not controlled .
We &apos;ll have to reduce her under general .
I needed to confirm that she with@@ held information
And now
You can &apos;t be sc@@ ared of what &apos;s next .
Can you just let me in ?
Ok@@ ay , here &apos;s the deal .
I hardly think so .
Did someone say ... &quot; party &quot; ?
I supp@@ ose that &apos;s possible , but for the record ,
Fin@@ e. if I do have a thre@@ es@@ ome , you can &apos;t be part of it .
If you make a mark in a min@@ t com@@ ic book , it &apos;s no longer min@@ t .
Well , of course , i .. oh .
Let &apos;s throw le@@ on@@ ard a k@@ ick@@ -@@ ass birthday party .
This is the secret kno@@ ck .
The whole point of a secret kno@@ ck is to establish a
P@@ ossi@@ bly , but unver@@ i@@ fied .
So what &apos;d you get the birthday boy ?
And I got him this amazing auto@@ graph@@ ed copy
I got him a swe@@ ater .
I &apos;ve seen him get chil@@ ly .
That &apos;s because I didn &apos;t bring one .
The entire institution of gi@@ ft-@@ giving makes no sense .
Friends give each other presents .
Try telling him it &apos;s a non-@@ optional social convention .
Just do it .
Fin@@ e. it &apos;s out of the washer !
What do you think ?
Because of the two additional e@@ ther@@ net ports ?
He &apos;s already got a si@@ x-@@ port e@@ ther@@ net switch .
Why ? I don &apos;t know .
p@@ enny , if I &apos;m going to buy le@@ on@@ ard a gift ,
Water ! need water ! I &apos;ll be right back .
Ye@@ ah , well , so do i .
I don &apos;t think I can .
Ok@@ ay , you have to understand something .
Why ? is le@@ on@@ ard ok@@ ay ?
Thanks for asking , by the way .
Listen , just hold him there a little longer .
O@@ k , , how about this ?
Don &apos;t toy with me , woman .
Th@@ y will be done .
Well .
What the hell are they telling you in boot camp ?
We &apos;re in the vicinity of enemy nav@@ al forces .
Po@@ ckets , everything , p@@ ile it on the shirt .
I got my pocket knife .
Pair of p@@ liers , bit of wire ,
Al@@ dri@@ ch .
take another dri@@ ft set . That &apos;s not how I &apos;m reading those wave tops .
15 degrees . S@@ ame read as the out@@ bound , Chief .
Al@@ dri@@ ch ?
No , thanks .
It &apos;s beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
I was doing all right , see . I didn &apos;t expect no , &quot; A. &quot;
I thought I ought to get a &quot; B &quot; or any@@ ways a &quot; C &quot;
And I had this course down good .
So what &apos;d you do ?
And you had that course down good , you reck@@ on .
A@@ in &apos;t there a rule ?
Su@@ cks the water right out of your bra@@ ins , they say .
Five days , not a si@@ p .
Al@@ dri@@ ch ? More like sou@@ theast two to three ?
Ok@@ ay , then .
Then where are we headed ?
Those islands I told you about , there &apos;s a chain of &apos; em to our southwest .
Now if this favor@@ able wind will just push us there .
The chart don &apos;t take us no@@ where .
No , you won &apos;t , Tony .
Why don &apos;t you sit here star@@ ing at nothing all day ?
What &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
Then where are these islands you told us about ?
K@@ id@@ neys would be easy .
I think we need some other kind of talk .
Just remembered something .
she had a pretty yellow dress .
So she se@@ wed a little white do@@ ve over the hole .
But I can &apos;t really see her face .
I do believe I am in love with your sister .
I want you boys to know ... .
So , take a look at the tim@@ eline here on Fut@@ u@@ rec@@ ast ...
As we get deeper into the afternoon , though ,
I don &apos;t know much .
A very good woman .
Do not forget ,
Death , however ,
Pra@@ y that she cross@@ es over to where she needs to go .
And she wants to do a bra@@ ve , no-@@ mak@@ eup role .
J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence wants to play me ?
So you want to sleep over again ton@@ ight ?
Maybe . She let me get a job at five .
And it was a boy and his n@@ ana .
They kind of make you at the shel@@ ter .
Any@@ way , how was &quot; The Price Is Right &quot; ?
It &apos;s Dre@@ w Car@@ ey , and he gets hou@@ se@@ wi@@ ves wet
Bob ! We &apos;re over here .
Is that my date Bob , or a different Bob ?
I think that &apos;s the very first Bob .
Carol@@ ine , this is Bob .
Nice to meet you .
I hope he means I &apos;m st@@ up@@ id .
Get@@ ting any ideas ?
Any@@ body want to do a little b@@ low ?
We have to be careful , Bob .
Step out of line .
Wa@@ it here . You &apos;re both in the mix .
He knows when you &apos;re f@@ aking it .
Keep it up . I like your pepper .
What are you doing here ?
I know , because I &apos;m in it .
I would &apos;ve been here so@@ oner ,
But Bob and I talked a lot about friendship on the helicop@@ ter@@ .@@ sh@@ v@@ s@@ ash@@ .com
Or S@@ ophie and G@@ w@@ yn@@ eth Pal@@ tro@@ w !
Now I have to sett@@ le for &quot; Frit@@ ter . &quot;
They actually want me here .
I &apos;m the st@@ up@@ id you should be with .
S@@ ophie , I &apos;m gon@@ na go with her .
It &apos;s 6 : 00 ! How long have you been kne@@ eling there ?
B@@ ree ...
May I say something first ?
Ex@@ ac@@ tly .
Maybe I can use this as a tiny n@@ ap@@ kin ring .
So am I making too much out of this ?
Ye@@ ah , he is , but ...
Inter@@ esting point . W@@ ish you h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t made it
The only female I &apos;ve seen has ant@@ lers .
Well , not just yet .
Thanks for the advice .
Her name is Car@@ ol .
Oh .. just ..
You &apos;ve been having a lot of sad days . Is it because Grace left ?
That was when you started being sad .. the day she went away .
I suggested she leave the lane for a while .
Oh , my god . So why ... why are you telling me this ?
And given how the neighb@@ ors feel about you these days ,
Some@@ one sold you their house ?
We sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have sold .
Which would have been very noble and very st@@ up@@ id .
Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t have a choice .
Mit@@ zi , what are you doing here ?
But we thought you left .
This guy says he has a job for me in the city .
Hu@@ h , and I got stuck with the minibar charges .
What ?
Lee ?
O@@ k .. ok@@ ay .
Some van just pulled up ,
Well , I don &apos;t like the way they &apos;re looking at me .
H@@ ey . I didn &apos;t ask her to move here .
maybe it &apos;s time you ask her to leave .
Thank you .
No . No , I think us is a mistake .
I wish we had stood by him when he was on trial .
But I won &apos;t allow him to destroy this street .
Don &apos;t worry .
That &apos;s a promise .
So , u@@ h , why are you here ?
U@@ h , wait . U@@ h , you don &apos;t need to do that .
Mayor Franklin . What an honor . Paul young .
U@@ h , with the election just a few days away ,
You &apos;re gon@@ na have to leave .
There have been no signals . I was dating your son .
Ok@@ ay . Ye@@ ah , y@@ e@@ ah , here we are .
B@@ unch of ge@@ eks with &quot; vote Franklin &quot; signs just showed up .
Who the hell are they ?
H@@ ey , guys . Gu@@ ys !
N@@ ope .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah .
Once the mayor begins his speech ,
All right ! Let &apos;s go !
Kath@@ le@@ en Kan@@ e , 38 .

The bat@@ ter was j@@ ammed with a fast@@ ball ,

One , two , three .
Som@@ ebo@@ dy p@@ aged me ?

U@@ h , just confir@@ ming I &apos;ll see you ton@@ ight at 7 : 00 ?
C@@ alli@@ e , we agreed to couples therapy .
Ok@@ ay , well , I &apos;ll be there .
We know . That &apos;s why this one &apos;s on us .
I didn &apos;t think I was gon@@ na get to go back to work .
Ye@@ ah , she &apos;s afraid she &apos;s gon@@ na sc@@ are the kids .
You guys !
You still want to study ?
We &apos;re gon@@ na take her into surgery and remove the frag@@ ments .
Why can &apos;t you tell me right now ?
Why ? !
What &apos;s this about a purchasing free@@ ze on the N@@ IC@@ U budget ?
Oh . Ok@@ ay .
We &apos;re buying them medicine .
That &apos;s baby blan@@ k@@ ets .
H@@ unt , where did my pro bon@@ o go ?
So I found someone at Seattle Pr@@ es who could do it .
Not anymore . Your patient is , u@@ h ..
Do you have any idea how difficult it is
M@@ m , no , there was no easy way .
You think you can just do whatever you feel like in the moment ,
No , just go . Let me clean up your m@@ ess .
And he &apos;s intim@@ id@@ ating B@@ ail@@ ey into not ordering one .
He made me his family , and then I abandoned him .
S@@ wal@@ low study ?
Ros@@ s .
And I &apos;m not gon@@ na let another one of us die .
Don &apos;t talk to me like I don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening .
Dr. Grey is here .
And I think you don &apos;t want her to be the one to do that .
Just you and me .
No , no , no . No more .
A@@ very . A@@ very , look .
You said you transferred her .
You lied ?
The money has to come from somewhere .
I ...
I know we &apos;re all doctors , and we &apos;re all busy ,
You are right .
I can &apos;t force you to
They &apos;ve all been short runs
Just throw her over your shoulder ,
She &apos;s the thing that &apos;s special , dum@@ bass .
You both want the same thing .
Stop being sc@@ ared .
I am not doing this because I want to .
What are you waiting for ?
If I keep push@@ ing , I &apos;ll send him into v@@ -@@ fi@@ b .
She told us to tell you that she loves you .
Sh@@ ep@@ herd ?
Wa@@ it . Mer@@ edi@@ th &apos;s here ?
Cra@@ p . I meant to text you .
The woman &apos;s wearing mis@@ mat@@ ched shoes . Cut her some sl@@ ack .
Send me a note next time .
You know you &apos;re in a building full of beds .
Ros@@ s , what did you do ?
unless it &apos;s hope or a reason to live .
Any@@ ho@@ o ,
As he &apos;s been at sea , perhaps something
Aqu@@ am@@ an ?
Ye@@ ah , just as well .
I &apos;d rather just sell it to a-@@ real coll@@ ector .
How rare is it ?
It &apos;s probably this st@@ up@@ id diet I &apos;m on .
I &apos;ve put on a couple pounds .
Well , we &apos;ve all seen your mo@@ m .
Hi , honey .
You &apos;re kid@@ ding , right ?
God , I thought we were partners in this marriage .
And for the last time , you &apos;re not fat .
&quot; cause one of you is lying .
How was dinner at your mo@@ m &apos;s ?
I had to ru@@ b her o@@ int@@ ment all over her again .
H@@ ey , you guys are 3-5 , right ?
No , ma &apos;@@ am .
Ma &apos;@@ am , if you set one foot in front of the other ,
Man , we are definitely losing the war
It &apos;s like fu@@ cking musical chairs .
No . Wh@@ atever you wear in Kab@@ ul is fine .
Yes .
A@@ w , your friend is me .
Mount up !
I &apos;ll come with you in the car if there &apos;s room .
I can make some calls . We can take my car .
I can &apos;t ...
I &apos;m fli@@ pping you the bird in here right now .
Yes .
I think it &apos;s very nice .
You are in the Blue Pir@@ is@@ o@@ in now .
Let &apos;s look now at the 12 first-@@ tier drivers in the current CO@@ IN para@@ dig@@ m .
Tac@@ tical and institutional ..
Kim B@@ aker .
If I &apos;m understanding this brief@@ ing ,
Ye@@ ah , I can give you something .
You keep going till the gor@@ illa wants to stop .
You know , Afghanistan produces 90 % of the world &apos;s nar@@ co@@ tic op@@ i@@ ates .
M@@ mm .
They &apos;d say , &quot; Oh , my son , he broke his arm . &quot;
What are we talking about , Fa@@ him ?
The human body produces its own hero@@ in .
That is hero@@ in , co@@ ca@@ ine and amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine , all at once .
Re@@ ally ? Thank you . That &apos;s ..
Well , how about a half of one ?
Ye@@ ah . Or I could buy you breakfast .
I think breakfast is of equal monetary value .
Ok@@ ay , I des@@ erve that .
I mean , there &apos;s only so much any of us have any control of ,
I mean , ma &apos;@@ am ...
So , u-@@ um , all set for ton@@ ight ?
O@@ oh , my favorite .
The real question is , what are your body &apos;s secrets ?
Oh , I can &apos;t wait . Ye@@ ah , y@@ e@@ ah .
Ok@@ ay . Ok@@ ay .
And are you ready to know ?
The hospital just wants me to rest a few more weeks .
My@@ r@@ na : Is everybody dec@@ ent ?
Lev@@ i . What was that , honey ?
C@@ ousin Sh@@ ir@@ l just called
Let me go ahead and gra@@ b you some wine .
Un@@ cle Saul .
S@@ ame to you , Un@@ cle Saul .
In@@ sul@@ ts is how we show love .
I &apos;ve heard a lot about you .
He &apos;s in end-@@ stage heart failure ,
I &apos;m afraid not , Saul , no .
Thank you .
I will never take it for granted again .
He saw you , who you are , all of you .
that you &apos;d have the freedom
I shall not want .
What
They can &apos;t stand each other .
But you haven &apos;t been around enough to notice , have you ?
It &apos;s not your fault .
Ye@@ ah .
I clearly still have some differences with Jackson ,
You know what , I set you up on a date without telling you ,
Al@@ right .
When the body reveals its secrets ,
Lev@@ i ? When did you get home ?
He &apos;s gone .
And the time has come ..
You can &apos;t begin to imagine how l feel .
If signing can spare her this pain ..
I love it !
Ok@@ ay , I-@@ I don &apos;t love it . It &apos;s just so ...
Trust me . This will be great .
Well , you certainly know how to sell yellow .
I hear you &apos;re get@@ tin &apos; divor@@ ced .
I &apos;m getting divor@@ ced , too , so we both need guys .
U@@ h , I don &apos;t know how much Lyn@@ ette has told you about me ,
But two , and it &apos;s girls &apos; night out .
You up for a little stu@@ d hunting ?
Oh , come on .
That hair does come down , doesn &apos;t it ?
Inside , over there .
Come on . Come on . We &apos;re gon@@ na get started .
Oh . Ye@@ ah .
When I was 8 , d@@ ad@@ dy left m@@ ama ,
Of course , there were always m@@ ama &apos;s boy@@ friends ,
You are loving this .
G@@ ets to finally smoke pot and be cool .
The only reason I didn &apos;t smoke back then
Care to join me out back behind the garage
And I am so lucky .
I mean just so happy it &apos;s working .
What do you think ? Does this say
Ye@@ ah , but things are starting to turn around l@@ ately .
Get out !
Oh , h@@ ello , sil@@ k !
Stand@@ ing there in the m@@ all , it just hit me .
Not knowing where she is ,
Well , there &apos;s a private det@@ ective I work with .
If &apos;s not surprising the hospital couldn &apos;t find &apos; em .
When I was in labor ,
That &apos;s gon@@ na help .
We &apos;ll do our best .
Absol@@ utely .
H@@ ey . I just came by to pick up my en@@ vel@@ ope for the week .
And don &apos;t listen to this conversation .
I &apos;m buying all my girls ste@@ aks . You got a pre@@ ference ?
This is a cock@@ tail car@@ dig@@ an .
Where &apos;s your clos@@ et ?
Are you sure this is a clos@@ et and not a portal to the 1950s ?
Oh , I won &apos;t need a ride . I &apos;m going home with K@@ eit@@ h .
Oh , he &apos;s pul@@ ling the car around .
&apos;@@ cause I &apos;m not .
Oh . I &apos;ll be careful when I un@@ wra@@ p him .
Why ?
You don &apos;t want to come off like a s@@ lu@@ t .
Ren@@ ee , wait ! What about me ?
Stay in the di@@ m light and don &apos;t play hard to get .
Do you know why that is ?
Mrs. M@@ m@@ c@@ cl@@ us@@ ky . I really need to know .
But he was ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated .
Ye@@ ah , for that crime .

Ye@@ ah , well , I know what that &apos;s like .

Fl@@ at screen TV , clos@@ et full of new clothes .
But you know how it is .
Ye@@ ah , I get that .
Me , too .
Um .. gos@@ h . I gu@@ ess I &apos;m going on six years .
Wa@@ it . No suit ?
No pre@@ ten@@ tious Euro wa@@ iter listing speci@@ als

And we can have a f@@ ancy dinner and celebrate
Re@@ ally ? What &apos;s the neighborhood saying about me ?
For star@@ ters ,
Hu@@ ber .

I got totally b@@ aked off of it this morning .
Du@@ de ...

You did what ? !
I didn &apos;t know what else to do !
Here we go@@ .@@ Here we go .
There &apos;s no record on file that co@@ oper even had a car .
Back then , a ch@@ ev@@ y that size probably got what ,
Now , why would a guy headed to Mexico ,
Give me that magic mark@@ er .
I want everything you &apos;ve got in that per@@ im@@ eter .
The def@@ ective cable runs right bene@@ ath your garage .
Well , who &apos;s gon@@ na pay for this
We &apos;ll just dig a small tr@@ ench ,
How long is it going to take ?
We really need to get started , ma &apos;@@ am .
Now that depends on who I &apos;m sitting with .
fine , that &apos;s ok@@ ay .
But the two of you being here right
I want my share of the money .
A@@ in &apos;t we did this dance before ?
Then I thre@@ aten to tell som@@ ebo@@ dy about what &apos;s going on here .
Why don &apos;t we just stop wa@@ sting time , all right ?
Dam@@ n , man , you still alive ?
How &apos;d you find us ?

I don &apos;t know what that means .
Are you wearing Angel Perf@@ ume ?
Oh@@ .@@ E@@ n ..
that remin@@ ds you of an ex , I take it .
now , was that good memories ..
Both .
I don &apos;t want to talk about it .
Use the hose on the other side of the house .
down the road , if you &apos;re in trouble ,
Post a note on the message board .
you can look for yourself .
Mr. Mah@@ one .
Those escap@@ ed convic@@ ts.@@ They &apos;re here in town .
It &apos;s the police , ma &apos;@@ am .
Yes .
There was this strange man .
I thought he was Bil@@ ly .
A long ... bath .
do her routine , see .
Thanks . I painted it myself .
I represent J@@ et@@ ate@@ ch . Are you familiar with us ?
Oh , you &apos;ll have to for@@ give J@@ ay .
Any@@ way , our building is two doors down ,
That &apos;s a nice offer , J@@ are ,
We &apos;re building my son@@ -in-@@ law &apos;s dream ,
Some@@ day , I hope to get into encryp@@ ted pack@@ et switching .
J@@ ay , this man &apos;s vision just got bl@@ ur@@ ry with t@@ ears .
I just said that cra@@ p to drive the price up .
I don &apos;t want him to come back .
We &apos;re in this to make money .
By the power v@@ ested in me by the commercial z@@ oning board ,
That &apos;s a good omen .
Any@@ body else bring a sho@@ vel ?
The staff is in an u@@ pro@@ ar about these budget cuts .
I don &apos;t know what else to do .
What do people give each other , anyway ?
Sh@@ ut up ! You are not a puzzle sol@@ ver , you never have been .
Now there is a man in there about to die .
He is the Napoleon of black@@ mail .
The alternative , however , would require your approval .
Did you miss me ?
How is the ex@@ ile going ?
Well , I certainly hope you@@ ve lear@@ nt your lesson .
Miss me ?
Mrs Hu@@ dson , there is a woman in my sitting room !
She &apos;s a client .
Would you , er , care to sit down ?
You ask her !
For God &apos;s sake , give her some lines ,
You may speak freely in front of him ,
However , before you do ,
You have recently married a man
Good Lord , Hol@@ mes !
Her perf@@ ume ?
How so ?
We are ready to begin .
Sometimes to solve a case , one must first solve another .
An old one , very old .
Deep ? In@@ to what ?
You , you &apos;re dead , you can &apos;t be here , you died !
As beautiful as the day you married me ?
What the hell is all this about ? !
You may leave any time you like .
That &apos;s an order .
I never say that .
First of all , this is definitely E@@ mel@@ ia Ric@@ ol@@ etti .
Beyond a doubt , it is her .
That was also E@@ mel@@ ia Ric@@ ol@@ etti .
She was posi@@ tively identified
H@@ mm , maybe it was a secret twin .
A secret twin .
A twin that nobody knows about .
Since the moment of conception .
It is never tw@@ ins , Wat@@ son !
More to the point , what &apos;s your problem ?
Oh , isn &apos;t he observ@@ ant , now that D@@ ad@@ dy &apos;s gone
Yes , really .
What &apos;s he saying that for ?
Well , Hol@@ mes ? Sur@@ ely you must have some theory ?
These are deep waters , Wat@@ son , deep waters .
It was not for several months that we were to pick up
Five of them now , all the same , every one of them .
What is ?
How do you know that ?
I &apos;m not a k@@ id anymore .
Well .
Oh , honey , a part of me still sees you
I had a pair that mat@@ ched .
Because you were a grown woman in pink stri@@ ped over@@ alls .
They &apos;d say we looked sweet together .
I know this is hard .
This is really happening to me .
What did , u@@ h , fran@@ k do ?
Hand@@ ed me a box of kle@@ en@@ ex , said all the right things .
Well , think of it this way .
Your marriage is over .
Y@@ ip@@ pe@@ e for me .
The only way to live life is wil@@ dly .
You took b@@ ree out drinking ?
How the hell could ren@@ ee take her out drinking ? !
I have known ren@@ ee a long time ,
I don &apos;t know . There &apos;s not enough boo@@ ze in the world
An intervention ? You &apos;ve got@@ ta be kid@@ ding me .
Get out ! All of you !
I@@ di@@ ot .
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
And what about all these men ? We know about that , too .
And did you also know i tried to kill myself ?
Oh , my god .
If this is a jo@@ ke , it &apos;s not funny .
I checked into a mot@@ el room
With the jo@@ cks at Sou@@ thwest ?
You know who &apos;s going to be a terminal vir@@ gin ?
The fact that you two work at the airport .
Here comes the almost bri@@ de .
I &apos;m making friends in the T@@ SA .
Having lunch with her at the Wo@@ k N &quot; Roll
Opening day , I &apos;m so excited
If it isn &apos;t , you &apos;re not doing it right .
Finally , I won &apos;t be stu@@ ff@@ ed in the back .
Come on , let &apos;s open up .
I love this job .
They can all su@@ ck it .
O@@ oh , you go , gate .
Also , a little dr@@ unk .
Y@@ ep .
Well , I gu@@ ess I have time to go check my mak@@ e-up
H@@ an is planning a party .
That &apos;s true . I really can cry anywhere now .
I can &apos;t believe I work at the airport , Max .
Hello .
Do I get a prize ?
I &apos;m on board now . I love this job .
I &apos;m your M.@@ C. , H@@ an Lee ,
Ok@@ ay , here we go .
The more you play with it , the harder it gets .
You su@@ ck ! Next act .
H@@ old on a minute .
I just got a text from Jos@@ h , the pilot .
C@@ ute that he forgot your name ?
I took off my under@@ wear last week and a co@@ y@@ ote h@@ ow@@ led .
I &apos;m talking about you , Max .
Have a drink .
A compli@@ ment and an ins@@ ult in just one word .
Oh no , no , no , no , no .
How can you@@ -@@ say the word &quot; No &quot;
And not the kind where I can loo@@ t .
Mine exp@@ ires next month .
You cook with eggs so old they fight back .
She has major trust issues
What &apos;s there to say about these two kids ?
S@@ ophie , Qu@@ ite loud .
You su@@ ck , next act !
And , O@@ leg , I &apos;m so glad S@@ ophie is mar@@ rying you
Ye@@ ah , I hear ya girl .
Oh , it hur@@ ts . It really hur@@ ts .
What ?
She needs a crash &quot; c &quot; while Sh@@ ep@@ herd hand@@ les the ble@@ ed .
But when your patient &apos;s a child ...
Ye@@ ah .
Oh , you already have one .
I want your coffee . I need your coffee .
Chief , you need me ?
As St@@ ev@@ ens left no forwar@@ ding address ,
We work here at the hospital .
I &apos;m sorry .
What &apos;s yours in for ?
U@@ h , 100 m@@ ics of f@@ ent@@ any@@ l , please .
My baby . Where &apos;s my baby ?
Can I see her ?
So is the baby .
Please . I want to hold my baby .
She can &apos;t .
It &apos;s ok@@ ay . It &apos;s gon@@ na be ok@@ ay .
Cra@@ p . 9-@@ 1-@@ 1. it &apos;s her baby .
C@@ ould I help ?
She &apos;s only 30 week@@ s. pretty young to survive .
M@@ m , pretty much .
It is what it is@@ . it &apos;s protocol .
You buy him more time
Rob@@ b@@ ins .
If they want surgery for their son ,
I believe you can do this successfully .
The surgery is a bad idea , chief
Ok@@ ay ?
Oh , you don &apos;t even want to know .
My parents couldn &apos;t do a thing about it .
No ? ok@@ ay .
All right , n@@ ails in , everything &apos;s tight .
Fant@@ astic .
Oh , come on@@ . give me a break here , Hill@@ ary .
The patient was cr@@ ash@@ ing .
It was a procedure I &apos;ve done before .
Ye@@ ah , but what if she wasn &apos;t ?
No , he &apos;s not gon@@ na fire me
For the record , you rock that in there .
Sh@@ ut up .
Tell me I &apos;m great .
You &apos;re great .
Cl@@ amp .
Can som@@ ebo@@ dy get me more light ?
Come on , Wall@@ ace .
He &apos;s inf@@ ective shock .
You know , I can help .
because as long as you &apos;re standing
So how about it , Phi@@ l ?
Oh . And I suggest you lose this number .
Ye@@ ah , I was pretty ti@@ cked off
&quot; U su@@ ck . &quot;
Is you didn &apos;t believe in me , and you believe in everything !
And here I pick blue yar@@ n to match your eyes ,
Come on .
It &apos;s bad that the baby li@@ stens to such terrible things .
Hello you .
I kind of ow@@ e you an ap@@ ology .
So is this real ?
I gu@@ ess one too many .
Can I buy you a drink ?
This is where I come all the time .
Oh right here .
So what can this piece of ass get you ?
Ye@@ ah , you . Come on . Get ou@@ tt@@ a here .
I don &apos;t know . It &apos;s been a@@ while .
No ? Why no ? Look out there , man .
I don &apos;t care about that .
I pick up your gro@@ c@@ eries , I help you with your laundry , your .
I clean up your sh@@ it !
Nothing you could ve done
So even though Dr. Sh@@ ep@@ herd was able to fix
She &apos;s only 16 .
She &apos;ll be an excellent candidate for organ donation .
Du@@ de ..
The chief , he needed a scap@@ eg@@ o@@ at . It &apos;s so un@@ fair .
I can &apos;t do this .
How should I know ? I thought she was here .
So what do you want me to do about it ?
So why don &apos;t you talk to her and find out
She won &apos;t talk to me .
It &apos;s just George .
Wh@@ -@@ What is that anyway ?
And I lost my shot at the solo surgery
There won &apos;t always be fi@@ anc@@ ee who &apos;s come back from their dead
I mean , the only time they ever bo@@ ther with us
Dr. Slo@@ an took the time to teach me today ,
Oh , don &apos;t tell me you haven &apos;t noticed his eyes on your ass .
Is he cutting into her thro@@ at ?
So I supp@@ ose you &apos;ll use a strip test
I can leave .
I was just trying to learn
I &apos;m very sorry for your loss but tests confirm
I &apos;m Dr. Di@@ x@@ on .
Please , she &apos;s our baby . We need more time .
They could save many lives .
I &apos;m very sorry for your loss but your sister can &apos;t wake up .
I knew what I was doing , so if you want to pun@@ ish someone
So if I were you ,
There are people dying .
It &apos;s in@@ appropriate .
You made it personal .
Those were all our intern@@ s .
They picked me .
Then none of us do .
I think there &apos;s something wrong with her . M@@ er .
Not here .
Ye@@ ah . I need you to sc@@ ru@@ b in with me .
I &apos;m fre@@ aking out . I &apos;m fre@@ aking out
I can &apos;t believe that . Who does that ?
If you screw this up and kill this guy
This was my chance to earn it back
Go@@ d@@ speed , old friend .
No , he &apos;s not dead . He &apos;s just sleeping .
H@@ ey , Mrs. D. H@@ ey , Lu@@ cy .
Well , that &apos;s a nice shirt .
It &apos;s my best seller .
I wish I was inspired like you .
Open yourself up to some new experiences
Fine . Just ..
Good , you wo@@ ke him up .
I decided to go gentle with Phi@@ l ,
But come on . He &apos;s been alive a month .
What the hell ?
What a sweet ride , Pep@@ per .
I &apos;ve been gol@@ fing for a few weeks .
I grew up gol@@ fing with my father ,
Well , we should play together as a four@@ some .
Did you see that ? !
H@@ ey , listen , I &apos;m sorry I y@@ elled .
My old tum@@ bling master in college used to y@@ ell at me all the time .
Re@@ ally ?
He &apos;d say terrible things about my man@@ hood ,
You st@@ ink , Phi@@ l .
Did you hear that ?
He was talking to 10-@@ year-old you
I was just trying to help .
She doesn &apos;t believe in psych@@ ics .
I &apos;m going to save you some time .
Maybe not now , but soon .
That means
I see a hand@@ some man on a horse ,
Yes , I know .
Even if there was , I wouldn &apos;t go .
I gu@@ ess some people just aren &apos;t comfortable taking center stage .
He &apos;s too sick .
It &apos;s always dark@@ est right before the ..
Ok@@ ay , well , I gu@@ ess we only have one option .
Un@@ bear@@ able .
And the cat &apos;s in the cra@@ dle
I never made the time .
I need to call my son .
Why don &apos;t I just draw them a map ?
I can &apos;t , Carl ! My boy &apos;s sets are in a play !
Yes , it &apos;s Mann@@ y .
Yes , that &apos;s it .
Do you feel that ?
Or the A.@@ C. k@@ ick@@ ed in .
Come on , m@@ ama . Let &apos;s get you un@@ packed .
it &apos;s all recipes .
Some of these have been in my family since before the war of northern aggres@@ sion .
I mean what I mean .
I gu@@ ess mi@@ ke didn &apos;t tell you that i &apos;m , u@@ h , really not a cook .
That &apos;s why I gave you these recipes , and I &apos;m gon &apos; teach you how to make &apos; em , too .
So should I s@@ ne@@ ak out the back ?
She knows you &apos;re dealing ?
oh , h@@ ey , guys !
I wish I could say the same for your real estate agent .
What is this ?
It &apos;s a house listing .
It &apos;s all an act , swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ t . You don &apos;t see it now , but you will .
I don &apos;t know what exactly .
Oh , sure . That &apos;s it . D has some evil plan .
He isn &apos;t capable of love , d@@ yl@@ an .
Mo@@ ve if you want .
But what happened ? Things were going fine .
I was thinking I &apos;d take him for a few hours .
Well , b@@ ree , whenever I call , it &apos;s not a good time ,
you give her a dental exam with your tongue ?
I don &apos;t think so .
I am not having this argument .
Not exactly .
elli@@ e , your door is locked ! El@@ lie !
M@@ om , gu@@ ess what ? D@@ ad &apos;s coming to my senior rec@@ ital next week .
We could make it a real family ou@@ ting .
I &apos;m not done saying goo@@ d-@@ b@@ ye .
Please get rid of that g@@ um .
Me@@ aning what ? You still love me ?
And I know I &apos;m somewhat to bl@@ ame for what &apos;s happened between us .
The least you can do is meet me hal@@ f@@ way .
Maybe not , but I &apos;m gon@@ na give it to you anyway &apos; cause ...
C@@ ould we ?
&quot; S@@ elling drugs brings in more money than waiting tables . &quot;
Ye@@ ah ! And she came up with that tat@@ too cover story to hide her il@@ lic@@ it b@@ aking .
Yes , and I &apos;m a convic@@ ted fel@@ on still on prob@@ ation .
Are you involved with either one of them ?
And Mal@@ col@@ m , I did have a thing but it &apos;s over .
Yes . I heard .
It would &apos;ve been a@@ wesome if you saw No Ex@@ it .
I was al@@ right .
Figure out why he &apos;s doing ,
Um , it &apos;s just really nice of him to help out .
No , I &apos;m fine . Just go get a drink or something , ok@@ ay ?
Oh I hope so .
Nice to meet you . Hi , how are you ?
of friends who &apos;ve been trying for years .
So we &apos;ll see .
It &apos;s really nice to meet you .
I think I des@@ erve a class of wine after all that , don &apos;t you ?
Yes , thank you . Does everyone have a glass ?
Let &apos;s have a to@@ ast , to Christmas .
Now , I don &apos;t see anything ab@@ normal in your MR@@ I ,
And your blood work came back completely clear .
You have spor@@ adi@@ c memory im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment ,
So I think we should do a PE@@ T Scan .
I know what a PE@@ T Scan is .
I want to see if the results are consistent with Alz@@ heimer &apos;s Dis@@ ease .
Now last time I asked you to bring in a close relative .
Ok@@ ay . But next time , for sure . Ok@@ ay ?
Oh God , back to square one .
I don &apos;t remember .
How long are you going to , um , keep at that thing ?
John swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ t , wake up .
I need to talk to you .
What are you talking about ?
You &apos;ve been seeing a neuro@@ log@@ ist , why ?
I assume that if I have the gene ,
And if they are carriers , what ,
The kids will all be here for our anniversary .
Not until we have the test results .
I w@@ anna know as soon as possible .
I mean here we are in a major hospital , and they only have one elevator running ?
We could &apos;ve taken the stairs by now
What &apos;s going on ?
Are you guys gon@@ na break up or ?
M@@ om , are you sick ?
Tom turned out negative and Ly@@ dia didn &apos;t want to know
I &apos;m ok@@ ay .
They can be sure the bab@@ ies will be ok@@ ay .
I &apos;ll have a regular with blu@@ e@@ berries and co@@ con@@ ut please .
Um , I went for a run .
Well , then I went to P@@ ink@@ berry .
Ye@@ ah .
Sus@@ an Kir@@ by and her husband .
I tex@@ ted you , I em@@ ailed you . There are ways to -
I had absolutely no idea where you were ,
Yes !
I hate it too .
I know , I know John .
I might not be able to remember names or answer simple questions ,
Rel@@ ative to what ?
Don &apos;t say that .
People have cancer and they wear pink ri@@ bb@@ ons for you
Oh that &apos;s good .
Res@@ idents are issued a b@@ racelet instead which keeps them from using elev@@ ators
I see
even dist@@ res@@ sed by the confusion they experienced from all the stim@@ ulation .
Staff looks for opportunities to many meaning@@ ful connections with residents .
One woman who had worked as a nur@@ se sat part of most days
We don &apos;t have any restrictions on visiting times .
It doesn &apos;t look anyone is here today .
What &apos;s that ?
Is she al@@ right ?
It &apos;s all women .
There is William over there .
They &apos;re just not powerful enough to put me to sleep .
What about Roh@@ yp@@ no@@ l ?
Hi Alice , I am you and um , I have something very important to say to you .
And don &apos;t tell anyone what you &apos;re doing
Me too .
Don &apos;t do that to me . Oh my God .
You were dealing with a lot , what was it ? About a year after ?
I know I said this before
Ye@@ ah .
If you mean b@@ low jobs on the beach ,
Well you were rel@@ ent@@ less . You wanted everything . And all at once .
Anna &apos;s the same way right ?
Thank God you do .
And we &apos;re gon@@ na do what ? Drive around the country in an R@@ V ?
Well , I think our summer on the island is all the excit@@ ement I can handle .
H@@ ey when are you going to the conference ?
And when is U@@ y@@ dia coming
Yes , yes we are . I just have to go pe@@ e , I &apos;ll be right back
You work all the time .
Ye@@ ah , the scope of it
You must &apos;ve known , you must &apos;ve known som@@ ebo@@ dy that died from AIDS , right ?
We lost a lot of people .
You did the scenes in your acting class .
I don &apos;t know , you must &apos;ve told me .
We must live , we must live .
why , for what purpose they are all suffering ,
Tom@@ orrow I will go off on my own , and I will teach ,
H@@ ey , you were amazing .
Often they &apos;ve managed to su@@ stain
Thank you .
But sometimes I see patients &quot; Plat@@ o &quot; even at this point ,
Will you be there ?
I &apos;m going to be away on business in Minnesota , so I wor@@ ried .
I think it would be great for her .
Ye@@ ah , and I &apos;m sure it &apos;s about it , but .
Have you thought about making it more personal ?
You know , you &apos;re not speaking to a room of scientists ,
O@@ k , don &apos;t ask me then .
H@@ ey , mo@@ m , just give it one more shot , ok ?
I use this yellow ... ... yellow th@@ ing@@ y to mark it
Do you know it takes me three days to write this ?
No , it took me three days .
Three days .
I think I &apos;ll try to forget that just happened .
The night I met my husband ,
Who can take us seriously when we are so far from who we once were ?
And like any disease ,
I have people I loved de@@ arly ,
And please , do not think I am suffering ,
So living the moment , I tell myself .
and not beat myself up too much for master@@ ing the art of losing
Thank you for this opportunity ,
So you want us to move to
Are they coming ?
I look forward to see you .
I thought you were my sister .
Thank you so much for this .
J@@ E@@ ow are you feeling ?
G@@ id@@ dy Up .
One second .
Luke somehow beat me in the election for president ,
You &apos;re trying to tell me
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , ok@@ ay ?
Rainer &apos;s taking me to Cab@@ o for the weekend .
I wasn &apos;t sure if my hairdryer
I had two problems .
When Mann@@ y was 5 , he went to a pet@@ ting zo@@ o
Joe , relax .
Let go of me ! Oh , let go of me !
Good news .
I don &apos;t care about our hair anymore .
I still haven &apos;t gotten up the g@@ uts to tell my parents .
Well , I &apos;ll tell him .
And I am excellent at deliver@@ ing bad news with a smile .
I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll be fine .
They &apos;re gon@@ na be even better tomorrow
P@@ utting on your bedroom sli@@ pper
I gave C@@ am &apos;s F@@ iz@@ bo costume away .
The truck was here , and there were so many boxes ,
He &apos;s not going to believe that this was an accident .
He &apos;s gon@@ na know it &apos;s missing .
What ?
Well , if he was going to get the p@@ ig a blan@@ k@@ et ,
Ok@@ ay , I te@@ ed that one up-@@ for you .
Som@@ ebo@@ dy please lower my sp@@ latter g@@ og@@ g@@ les , boys ?
You do it .
I would be if they took a vote .
Maybe he &apos;s the one who &apos;s having an aff@@ air .
Has he joined a gym or bought sexy new under@@ wear recently ?
All right now , boys ,
We probably ought to do something .
It &apos;s the guy on the ground !
Gu@@ ys , help me out . I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m doing .
No no no , we &apos;re not gon@@ na save him !
J@@ ay@@ . get him off me !
Ah , hell , I &apos;m gon@@ na regre@@ t this .
Better safe than sorry .
That &apos;s class .
I think I felt enough for one day .
You know , I learned something today .
And this is a constant remin@@ der
So I &apos;m not gon@@ na .
Jer@@ ry , get me a sc@@ ot@@ ch .
It &apos;s a lot right now , Jer@@ ry .
What is all this j@@ unk ?
Th@@ -@@ There &apos;s nothing in the fridge .
I &apos;ve always heard there comes a time in life
But I &apos;m pretty mature for my age ,
Don &apos;t you usually open your magic shop by now ?
Do@@ esn &apos;t sound good for business .
I &apos;m trying to avoid one of the other shop owners .
It started with a dispute over a parking space
You didn &apos;t even have to turn around .
Oh , well , Mann@@ y &apos;s at school ,
Nothing . Just , like , a fashion magazine .
With all that information in your head ,
I doubt it .
What exactly do you want me to do ?
Come on , one across . Help me get started .
I &apos;ll clean my room , I promise !
You made it to the Summit of Ex@@ more .
I need to get these forms in by 5 : 00
Why don &apos;t we turn this party into a garden party ?
Oh , um , well , because they recommend it .
Ok@@ ay , well , so why doesn &apos;t everyone just ..
you know that ?
Life must be good , eh ?
You worry about me being hung@@ ry .
Come on
If your friend wanted you to know , why didn &apos;t he tell you ?
Un@@ less you want to be enemies .
Good . Me , too .
Su@@ c@@ re , get me out of here , please .
I &apos;ll testi@@ fy for you ,
It &apos;s amazing .
What did you tell me yesterday ? You are on your own
T@@ t &apos;s a cul@@ t classic .

And on the front line , we can &apos;t afford to fu@@ ck up .
I &apos;m all ears .
A lot of shooting
I mean , this guy , he probably dropped his piece

Mike , I &apos;m gon@@ na have to call you back .
Son of a b@@ itch . Bre@@ ak in my house ?
S@@ it down !
Ye@@ ah , well , it &apos;s been a long day .
But I got a problem I think you can help me with .
Now , you know me . You know who I am .
Some@@ one st@@ ole a lot of money from me .
But where you can help me is to figure out who killed my men .
When we got there , they were already dead
U@@ h-@@ hu@@ h . Look , I just don &apos;t know .
One of them was my son .
He shot Sam@@ my , and ... and I tried to help him ,
Tell me about him
I swe@@ ar to God . I have no idea who these people are
The DE@@ A has taken over
I &apos;ll really make it worth your while .

Now that sounds like a good deal .
Ok@@ ay .

Any@@ thing can get fixed .
I shot a co@@ p . I killed him .
I can &apos;t remember a fu@@ cking thing !
I am gon@@ na take care of you .
So , the m@@ ess was man@@ -@@ made .
What do you mean , what &apos;d I do with it ?
I get the picture .
You got cameras in the bathrooms ?
you know that is so illegal .
I &apos;m gon@@ na need to see foot@@ age from that camera .
I don &apos;t think the DE@@ A &apos;s gon@@ na go that far .
Mat@@ eo Per@@ ez
Now , he paid me a private visit .
Well , what are you gon@@ na do ?
Well , what if you don &apos;t ?
Now , you know go@@ d@@ dam@@ n well I didn &apos;t kill Sam .

I might have put that money somewhere safe .
Well , see , that &apos;s the problem .
I &apos;m not gon@@ na ask you again .
Yes , ma &apos;@@ am .
Several traffic c@@ ams show a van b@@ lowing through red lights .
I ran the plates , and the van belongs to Fer@@ ez .
Why ? You now have the offer of command in writing .
You know I &apos;d love you just as much if you were a mer@@ chant captain ?

No , thank you , Sir , never did have much of a taste for it .
So , your father grew corn on Cape Co@@ d .
As you can imagine , I suddenly grew tired of eating it every day .
Are you familiar with this story , Mr. Jo@@ y ?
Well , we all have our paths to sea .
Can &apos;t have been easy though , yet ..
Now , if the captain will exc@@ use me , there are wh@@ ale boats and watches to assi@@ gn .
Not a drop ?
That &apos;s a gor@@ geous girl , Mr. Jo@@ y .

We are two days behind .
Set st@@ uns &apos;s .

She might be old but she can still b@@ low , boys !

It could be Du@@ c@@ ie Island .
We will keep fir@@ es going night and day ,
They &apos;ve been here a long time , for no doubt ..
But no ship came .
If we stay , we die .
It &apos;s a privil@@ ege to know the moment of one &apos;s death in advance .
a cur@@ se to be so far from home ...
or a chance to sett@@ le scores .
Captain of what ?
It was as if O@@ wen Ch@@ ase himself had spoken .
