I think you &apos;ve helped enough .
Can &apos;t we talk for a minute ?
Wa@@ it . What do you mean ?

Good question , given this whole thing is about you .
B@@ ree , he wants re@@ ven@@ ge . He wants to bring you down ,
I will figure out a way to make things better .
don &apos;t talk .
Now before I give it to you ..
What I was going to say ..
They &apos;re my whole world . I have nothing else .
That &apos;s a bad position to make a deal from .
H@@ ey , you remember that deal I wanted to make with you ?
But at least he &apos;s honest about it .
Actually , you were the reason for that .
Do you remember when we were talking about this guy ?
Y@@ ep .
She likes cooking Italian because according to her ,
I &apos;ll have to have you over for sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti some night .

Was I going to say &quot; no &quot; ?
But let me know if you &apos;re going to stuff him with j@@ unk food .
We &apos;re going to Dis@@ ne@@ yland .
The cards seem completely out of order and random ,

And I said no planes , but we don &apos;t have a choice ,
Sorry . My bad &quot; ?

No , but it &apos;s how you talk to a woman , A@@ very .
Again , sometimes when you talk ,
She &apos;s sc@@ ared and she &apos;s wor@@ ried .
So point@@ less .
It &apos;s why we &apos;re doctors .
And whether we walk away leaving them better
If you love someone ,
I had that thought a lot , too .
I kept thinking about my wife and baby ,
So I kept wondering ...
And no matter how hard I tried to make him better ,

I-@@ I don &apos;t know anything about show business ,
Are you sure ?
We didn &apos;t get to tap the ju@@ icy v@@ ein that is Howard &apos;s .
Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband ?
The same way my boy@@ friend makes me feel terrible
No , no , no . This is not a fight .
Now it &apos;s a fight .
Howard started it .
I wasn &apos;t referring to this evening .

Leon@@ ard , would you wra@@ p it up ?
I &apos;m sorry , is the fact that my life &apos;s falling apart
You were wrong , friend Howard .
Have you heard back from Em@@ ily ?
And I &apos;m afraid she doesn &apos;t think you &apos;re right for her .
Who was that ?
I didn &apos;t recognize him .
What &apos;s wrong with it ?
I was thinking about the race ton@@ ight . We should get there early .
Never mind that .
All right , here we go .
P@@ ete , proceed , please .
How &apos;s the city ?
Are you still aller@@ gic to Mount K@@ isco ?

You look beautiful
Have you got the roads locked down ?
We are at the finish line and B@@ enny is in the C@@ ess@@ na .

Ok@@ ay , gentlemen , please be advised , I got traffic ahead .
That was close . He got lucky .
Sorry , little bud@@ dy .
B@@ enny !
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
I figured , you know , you must be lost .
After 10 years , you w@@ anna just pick up some lo@@ cker room fight .
I w@@ anna see you build a real car .
I do it .
Ok@@ ay , I just w@@ anna be the first to take the floor here and ask you ...
You &apos;re gon@@ na have us work for D@@ ino Bre@@ w@@ ster ?
You don &apos;t w@@ anna have anything to do with that piece of sh@@ it .
Write a po@@ em or some sh@@ it . Ok@@ ay ?
&quot; Dear An@@ ita , Nothing is swe@@ eter than An@@ ita
Y@@ o , forget about that f@@ ool and his tur@@ t@@ len@@ eck .
We &apos;re doing fine without him .
Ok@@ ay . We &apos;re not doing fine .
That guy from earlier ..
And he &apos;s just gon@@ na keep coming back .
Wa@@ it . We made five grand ton@@ ight .

We always do .
If you guys don &apos;t show up tomorrow to work on that car ,
This is Car@@ roll Shel@@ by . This is an opportunity of a lifetime .

You just can &apos;t keep up .
All right , all right , all right .
She &apos;s not from around here , Pet@@ ey ,
It &apos;s 900 hor@@ se@@ power , baby .
Are you kid@@ ding me ?
Look , miss , this isn &apos;t the kind of car you can just go to the m@@ all and buy .
Can I see the engine ?
5.@@ 8 li@@ ter , aluminum block ,
I wasn &apos;t exp@@ ecting that .
Because I &apos;m a woman ? Or because I &apos;m from England ?
It had a Ford 260 C@@ ID V@@ 8 engine . Of course , you already knew that .
smart because they have a f@@ ancy acc@@ ent .
So , this is how it goes , is it ?
H@@ ey , J@@ ules .
Well , that &apos;s what it costs .
I am what In@@ gram thinks ,
Three is absur@@ d . That &apos;s why nobody has bid on it .
You haven &apos;t driven it , D@@ ino . To@@ bey &apos;s had the keys the whole time .
What &apos;s the top speed ?
He &apos;s talking about a theoretical top speed .
She &apos;ll go 230 .
This car is faster .
In@@ gram is going to buy it on the spot .
H@@ ey .
And hat is ome h@@ el of a car .
That &apos;s the price .
If you lose ,
This is the biggest house I &apos;ve ever seen .
Don &apos;t worry , he &apos;s in Monaco .
They &apos;re all Euro-@@ spe@@ c cars , so technically , they don &apos;t even exist here .

Ye@@ ah , well , then let me race .

If this thing works , we &apos;re gon@@ na need that head start .
We haven &apos;t convinced him yet , but we will . It &apos;s Fin@@ n .
I &apos;ll know in an hour .
So , what do you think ? First American car to win De Leon ?
You don &apos;t even have an invite .
No@@ body knows where the race is until you get the invite ,
And we also know that ome of the drivers is .
California is quite a big state
There &apos;s a drivers &apos; meeting the night before the race .
And your problem is .
You &apos;re not going anywhere .
And In@@ gram is not going to leave this car
Ok@@ ay .
I &apos;ll bro@@ om her ass out . Ok@@ ay ?
Ok@@ ay , so you &apos;ve never been a right-@@ se@@ ater .
First of all , you &apos;re wearing high he@@ els .
But if it &apos;s a real problem , then I can always ...
You mean that bus , bus , bus .

Do you w@@ anna do this here ?
But you know that , right ?
Watch yourself , To@@ bey .

You see anything we can use ?
That &apos;s it , other than that , I &apos;m off the clock .
Wa@@ it a minute , where &apos;s his calendar ?
Here , Um , take a look at this .
There &apos;s absolutely nothing on it but a star .
This whole thing was a mistake .
Sco@@ field got us a card within 24 hours ...
He knows what he &apos;s doing .
But he follows my recommendations , Don .
Now 7 / 16 at 4 : 00 p.m. &quot;
Not that we &apos;ve seen , no .
No , nothing .
When he has no business scheduled there ?

A meeting with himself , so that ..
Ok@@ ay , so 4 : 00 p.m. is our when , we need a where .
You wouldn &apos;t send all the information together .
At the same time as the London e-mail ?
Two more e-@@ mails followed from the same IP path .
It picked up the IP address , but not the content .
Oh , look , e-@@ mails get bo@@ unc@@ ed to rou@@ ters all over the world .
Wher@@ ever the mail &apos;s been , it leaves a shadow file .
Prob@@ ably squ@@ at@@ ted at the An@@ ah@@ eim server cluster ..
So that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to find your shadow file .
Not every ge@@ ek with a Commod@@ ore 64 can h@@ ack into NASA .
Have more fire@@ walls than the devil &apos;s bedroom .
It &apos;s on a main server in An@@ ah@@ eim .
I know what you &apos;re planning , Alex .
If you do track him down , call me .
I won &apos;t .
And Alex , I &apos;m so sorry .
I &apos;m sorry , they can &apos;t see you today .
Ok@@ ay .

Well , clearly it does . W@@ ha-@@ W@@ ha-@@ What &apos;s it do ?

Try again .
Even a back@@ -@@ door entry , I mean , you were in prison .
You want to stop breathing ?
They locked me out .
Looking forward to it .
That we could get a card@@ holder by today ?
I didn &apos;t have a choice !
And I am not going back to prison .
B@@ other me ? What are you talking about , son ?
I &apos;m going to be able to put a face to the voice .
Yes , and that is a Cri@@ me , my friend

I &apos;ll tell you what , Stu@@ art .
There they come .
Let her go .
You h@@ ook@@ ed me up with here , Don@@ nie .
Look , man , we both have worn the bad@@ ge in our day .
It was a meeting between all six card@@ holders .
And that should mean something .
I &apos;m gon@@ na call sen@@ ator Dall@@ o now .
The next Time you run from me .
I have not heard a word for weeks !
Don &apos;t worry about Leo .
This is war , Son@@ ya !
The scientist whom Jo@@ an and I worked with in Canada .
He &apos;s given the Russi@@ ans a wind@@ fall ,
Thank you .
It seems K@@ ier@@ l wasn &apos;t such a wet fish after all .
That might have been K@@ ier@@ l &apos;s contact .
Now , I know that from your file ,
On the .. On the boat .

Sh@@ eri@@ ff , are you aware of the video ..
Get out . You &apos;re not welcome here
Can you speak to the trage@@ dy ...
So , what &apos;s new with you ?
I don &apos;t really do that anymore .
He &apos;s being bom@@ bar@@ ded by law@@ yers w@@ anting to represent him .
Well , if it isn &apos;t the man , the my@@ th , the legendary pain@@ -in-@@ the-@@ ass K@@ eit@@ h Mars .
You catch any hus@@ bands l@@ ately with their p@@ ants down ?
We &apos;d love to see your di@@ rt@@ y-@@ picture collection .
Don &apos;t know yet . But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll figure something out .
Those days are gone now .
You get the c@@ liches ?

She was
Not really .
That &apos;s a funny thought , isn &apos;t it ? Me as a stabili@@ zing influence .

We &apos;re gon@@ na move on . We have a Bon@@ nie De Vil@@ le update .
Well , the fact is , I mean , Con@@ rad Mur@@ ray walked the streets for months .
I &apos;m saying that I wouldn &apos;t want to be in Log@@ an E@@ ch@@ oll@@ s &apos; shoes .

Re@@ ady to head down to the Bat@@ cave ?
Would lab@@ eling it &quot; P@@ and@@ ora &quot; have seemed a little , what , I don &apos;t know .
Hav@@ en &apos;t you spent nine years figur@@ ing out exactly who you are ?
Get@@ ting out of N@@ ept@@ une ?
D@@ ick saw a t@@ we@@ et that night saying Car@@ rie was showing up at the 09@@ er .
Later , she texts saying she &apos;s having a moment of weak@@ ness and needed my help .
Am I doing this now ?
Everyone knew her code , but this time it didn &apos;t work .
Now , the alarm goes off .
I knew it was the guard gate ..
But I didn &apos;t know the code word .
Then I see her bathroom door &apos;s open .
U@@ h , y@@ e@@ ah . I just got a call from my mo@@ ther@@ -in-@@ law
Because our location sc@@ outs are in N@@ ept@@ une today .
Look , I don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on here , but .

&quot; D. Pu@@ gh . Don &apos;t let the b@@ ast@@ ards get you down . Sh@@ ine your light . Car@@ rie . &quot;
H@@ a , ha . Like that &apos;s a valid exc@@ use .
Can you get me a student &apos;s permanent file ?
An educ@@ ator .
So you &apos;re saying it &apos;s gon@@ na be super@@ -@@ easy . Good . I did not want to put you out .
U@@ gh .
You made ba@@ il , Ver@@ on@@ ica .

Come on . I learned that way before law school
Sorry if I don &apos;t think you b@@ lowing up your life is a jo@@ ke .
This is who you picked up ?
I know , girlfriend . Is@@ n &apos;t it ?
She &apos;s good . It &apos;s like George Clo@@ on@@ ey and his friends .
Everything in my life has led to this moment .
I &apos;m the designated driver . That &apos;s the deal .
I forgot my pan@@ ties .
I &apos;ve let her draw hearts on my upper th@@ ig@@ h for the last 10 minutes .
H@@ ey , Log@@ an , is that your new girlfriend ?
H@@ ey .
Right this way , Mr. E@@ ch@@ oll@@ s .
Thank you .
Of course Ru@@ by chose the 09@@ er for her date .
This is Ver@@ on@@ ica . Ver@@ on@@ ica
I would feel pretty great about that actually . Thank you .
Where &apos;s your date ?
A@@ wake and away we go
I do take some comfort in that . How do you know ?

On a por@@ c@@ up@@ ine
What &apos;s up , V ?
You &apos;ve been to M@@ ama Le@@ one &apos;s before , right ?

It &apos;s Sus@@ an K@@ night . Car@@ rie &apos;s best friend .
the year I left for Stan@@ ford . Why are you showing me this ?
Come again ?
Check this out .
Then when people bo@@ o ..
They didn &apos;t let her come back to school .
Um , actually ...
her skills were sharp like blade of sword
Is that so ?
Tell the truth , you &apos;ve been sitting there since gradu@@ ation , haven &apos;t you ?
They really should have a bar right by the entrance
And I haven &apos;t been on my bike since Valent@@ ina was born .
Well , I &apos;ll be dam@@ ned .
as we say good@@ b@@ ye to old friends .
Some people just call it tex@@ ting .
He@@ h . Of course you do . It &apos;s a party .
I have told this story about 10 z@@ illion times , but ok@@ ay .
it &apos;s pretty bor@@ ing part@@ ying on a boat after about 15 minutes .
Ri@@ pped the boat apart looking for her .
Last time I saw Sus@@ an , she was b@@ lowing ch@@ un@@ ks over the side of the boat .
What a night@@ m@@ are .
M@@ ust have been aw@@ ful when you figured out she was missing .
I still can &apos;t go on a boat .
You already have a job . It &apos;s in New York .
Don &apos;t let this town take you down like it does everyone else .
Well , love is blind
I have someone in the sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s department ..
The ner@@ ve ? The sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s department is a jo@@ ke .
They &apos;re dangerous , Ver@@ on@@ ica .
I want you to stay away from them .
Well , that &apos;s not that bad .
Or I could just play her in drag . H@@ ey , Penn@@ y , give me your glasses .
If you &apos;ve got the cash , I &apos;ve got some hidden video I know you &apos;ll want to see .
Good job , F@@ en .
Of course .
Here &apos;s a tip . Change pro@@ fes@@ sions .
I need everything you got off Bon@@ nie De@@ Vil@@ le &apos;s tablet .
I am just a resp@@ ec@@ table business@@ man trying to earn an honest dollar .
Or I &apos;ll tell 50 C@@ ent &apos;s security team where they can find the guy ...
while singing &quot; After@@ noon Del@@ ight . &quot;
Do you have any idea what People will pay ..
T do the circuit .
If you have more than five IM@@ D@@ b credits .
H@@ a , ha . I &apos;m the reason people know Anne Ha@@ th@@ away has a vag@@ ina .
Any@@ way , you &apos;ll like this . I stu@@ ff@@ ed 30 tablets into those M@@ TV gift bags .
You &apos;re legal now , right ?
I &apos;m ass@@ um@@ ing it &apos;s a signed con@@ fession .
Quick@@ ly . Gu@@ ards at the security gate checked Log@@ an in at 1 : 15 a.@@ m .
Time of death some@@ time between 1 : 21 and 1 : 31
Many people , including Free Hu@@ gs over here , spoke to Car@@ rie after that .
Car@@ rie was alive when G@@ ia left , but G@@ ia didn &apos;t go alone .
Prob@@ ably in the tr@@ unk .
He wa@@ ited for his opportunity .
He shows up at the 09@@ er , establishing a very public ali@@ bi .
I supp@@ ose they mur@@ dered her for k@@ icks .
They mur@@ dered Car@@ rie because they were convinced she was cra@@ cking .
Some@@ thing worth killing Car@@ rie to keep secret
Where &apos;d you get these official police photos ?

I don &apos;t care if Log@@ an ain &apos;t the guy .
Now get the hell out of my office .

Log@@ an &apos;s coming over to talk about the case .
What ? I &apos;m Over 21
Ok@@ ay . I &apos;ll give them a call . Thanks .

I know , I need my public@@ ist .

That and the sk@@ irt were my idea .
S@@ part@@ ac@@ us was in that lim@@ o .
Well , it &apos;s not so much the sk@@ irt
Sc@@ ene of the crime .
Like to think I can handle myself ,
How did she get you that much cash
They scan cash now .
And if one of our Chicago boys gave her the money ,
You &apos;re leaving , Har@@ old ?
Did you finish with the thing on the dri@@ ve-@@ th@@ ru ?
Ok@@ ay@@ &apos;
Did you get your shift meal yet ?

Hi . Welcome to Ch@@ ick@@ W@@ ich . What can I get for you ?
Can I get a number one ?

Ye@@ ah , I know . I &apos;m sorry , but they were dirty . I didn &apos;t ...
Ok@@ ay , good . U@@ h , does she have a pur@@ se ?
I have ... I still have my pur@@ se .
It would be in the employee cub@@ ic@@ le area ,
Miss , be quiet .

I &apos;m gon@@ na need you to address me as si@@ r or officer , understand ?
Ok@@ ay , good .
Now , do ... do you want to tell me where it is ?
You don &apos;t have any money ?
I don &apos;t know .
I don &apos;t know why .
This isn &apos;t the easy way out of this , you understand ?
This is confidenti@@ al information . Ok@@ ay ?
We &apos;re hop@@ ing that if we can find the money that she st@@ ole ,
And here &apos;s the most important thing .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s important you take them to the car
Yes .
Sand@@ ra ! Are you or Mar@@ ti gon@@ na come help ?
Ok@@ ay , one of us will be right out .
Oh , my God .
Should I have my people start watching him ?
Oh , good@@ ness , no . No , no , no . Nothing like that , no .
Ye@@ ah , he does , like you can &apos;t imagine .
Oh , h@@ ey , listen . Kevin said that you told him about Beck@@ y &apos;s brother
I don &apos;t think I said much , though , did I ?
The last thing I need
If you can &apos;t cooperate with me here ..
I need to be able to trust you .
I &apos;m very sorry ..
That fall under sh@@ it that ain &apos;t none of my business .
What &apos;s it look like from there , Ev@@ an ?
Come on .
Nothing .
We &apos;re just waiting . That &apos;s all .
W-@@ When are they coming ?
Well , let me talk to him , then .
Hello , Officer Dan@@ iel@@ s . How is it going ?

Stop talking .
Hello . This is Van .
sounds like Sand@@ ra &apos;s running around
Yes , I &apos;m sure it &apos;s busy in there .
Is Sand@@ ra still in there ?
You have one minute left on this card .
What do you want me to do ?
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
You know ?
Can you tell her that ?
Can you put her on for me ?
I didn &apos;t do anything , si@@ r .
That all this would be hard on her ? Did we not ?
What about me , Re@@ bec@@ ca ?
You think I like situations like this ?
See ? Sh@@ ut up , Kevin .
Sand@@ ra ? From the South End store ?
I &apos;m sorry . What happened ?
The officer said you &apos;d been talking to him .
I &apos;ve got that thing going around .
I haven &apos;t talked to any@@ body today .
Is everything ok@@ ay ?
H@@ ey , you ok@@ ay ?
Yes , I &apos;ll have an original Ch@@ ick@@ W@@ ich ,
Its Officer Dan@@ iel@@ s , mess@@ ing with ya .
I was doing what I thought was the right thing .
Take a girl &apos;s clothes away
Did you know that the police station was only a half-@@ mile away ?
And I asked him .
And yet he never came , and that didn &apos;t make you suspicious ?
He had an answer every time that I asked a question .
W@@ ere you bra@@ in@@ wash@@ ed ?
Private place .
I didn &apos;t know you wrote stories
Just to where you stopped . It was a good part too .
What thing would that be ?
The wood is from an island southwest o Mad@@ ei@@ r@@ g . &quot;
No . The clu@@ es are all on that page .
&quot; One day , into the room came a young man ,
Then his wife must press them . Men don &apos;t have the talent
Well , no .
it &apos;s usually about his wife .
I prefer a c@@ ig@@ ar .
Did you write such a story ?
I must finish with you before I die .
Here .
I &apos;m going to need some help with the be@@ es .
The ar@@ mon@@ ica ?
He played it constantly till the day he died .
One hour per week .
Why are you here , Mr. Kel@@ mo@@ t ?
And it isn &apos;t just the lessons
And I heard her saying , quite clearly .
Tr@@ ying to see if I can tell where I &apos;ve been .
Mr. Hol@@ mes can tell things like that
See to the be@@ es !
G@@ ot a letter from your a@@ unt the other day .
Need a hou@@ se@@ ke@@ eper .
Can &apos;t stay here forever .
You said you never wor@@ e one .
She wanted the fic@@ tion@@ al@@ . ou are the real .
I think I was real once until T@@ oh@@ n made me into fiction
I &apos;m actually quite f@@ ond of a pipe ,
I &apos;ve never had much use for imagination .
My father would bring me here as a child .
We walk as gi@@ ants .
Sher@@ lo@@ ck-@@ san !
Is this a met@@ aph@@ ysi@@ cal question ?
Oh , I can &apos;t say that I &apos;ve ever mo@@ ur@@ ned the dead ,
Lo@@ gic is rare , and so ...
A few months ago , my brother My@@ cro@@ ft died .
I was given a small chest containing the Wat@@ son stories ,
But one of the titles pi@@ qu@@ ed my interest .
But by a fortun@@ ate chance , an opportunity soon arose .
Dear man , you should fear for your life .
Mur@@ der , Mr. Kel@@ mo@@ t . Mur@@ der .
Po@@ is@@ oned ?
But that night
So , I decided to write the story down on paper
You &apos;re not going to die
I had a 6@@ re@@ at unc@@ le who lived to be 102
I can &apos;t
Mr. Hol@@ mes !
C@@ ould have done .
He must have decided to take it sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously .
H@@ o . Made sure of that , didn &apos;t he ?
Should be in hospital . That or one of them places .
And the day he does is the day we go .
G@@ ot a letter from Japan .
Have you read it ?
S@@ in of desire . You@@ l &apos;re a Catholic .
And why do you think that is ?
If you read their letters , you &apos;d want to help .
It &apos;s just if I were to read them ,
Oh . I &apos;ll never go back to Japan .
Long journey , old man .
The crime wave that has done away
M@@ um , wait .
I &apos;m sure your mother doesn &apos;t need to be told where she &apos;s been .
It &apos;s not f@@ oo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness . Here .
Do it
Turn in a circle .
The s@@ oot on your dress att@@ ests that you went by train to Por@@ ts@@ mouth ,
wish@@ ed to make a favourable impression .
There is no sh@@ ame in what I do !
And you wish you had it better !
GO after her .
Your dad h@@ ated what he did for a living .
When he got called up , he said to me ,
B@@ lown out of the sky . First time up .
I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have said what I said
T@@ n your desk .
Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t know it was a desk until I opened it .
He left it at B@@ aker Street when he went off to get married
Yes , but in Wat@@ son &apos;s story , he does have the ar@@ mon@@ ica in it .
So maybe he did get things right .
John had gone from B@@ aker Street by then .
I don &apos;t know ! And if I ever did know , I don &apos;t remember .
And if I &apos;d brought it to a successful conclusion ,
I must have done something terri@@ bly wrong ..
One can &apos;t solve everything
Lo@@ gic is rare .
They &apos;re just on the other side of the wall .
P@@ ly your parl@@ our tri@@ cks elsewhere , Mr. Hol@@ mes .
I don &apos;t know much about your profession ,
To keep you from this appointment you seem so e@@ ager to make .
The man who took away the music you loved ,
And then I witness@@ ed your actions .
A convinc@@ ing set of circumstances ,
We must place bl@@ ame on your husband for the first .
I would also make the observation that there is nothing about you
The second was un@@ avo@@ id@@ able , and all the more dam@@ ning .
Everything about him , his clothes , the pat@@ ches on his tro@@ users ,
Money must have been a di@@ re necessity ,
For Grace . For T@@ ames .
Sho@@ ck
No , no ! No , Mrs. Mun@@ ro , no !
My son .... won &apos;t wake .
They sent me away till morning .
didn &apos;t think it would make a difference .
They &apos;re all you care about !
I care about him very much .
The be@@ es were not to bl@@ ame
And he did . He found the was@@ ps &apos; nest .
And so he did the worst possible thing .
How do you know it was them ?
There were no st@@ ings left in Roger &apos;s face .
I knew her less than a day .
She needed my help .
I wat@@ ched her walk away .
Well , that &apos;s what the people like .
That &apos;s what they want , my love .
It is not for me to question my gift ,
Come here and give P@@ unch some love .
Oh . Come on
So blessed I am to have va .
There you go ! Look at you
That thing does nothing but bel@@ low
I thought for certain
I s@@ ank into it .
From over here
Don &apos;t r@@ ush me , and then
We &apos;re about to be on the move .
We don &apos;t got no space for nothing more .
She &apos;s got skills in the theatre .
This pupp@@ et is broken . P@@ unch !
You can &apos;t be dro@@ pping the pupp@@ ets .
If you break this one &apos;s face ,
If one thing ever
Oh . Well
When you &apos;ve lived as long as I have ,
Some@@ one is close to ro@@ using the De@@ vil .
He &apos;s right there watching the re@@ hear@@ sal .
But he was right there .
I would not do your Stephen Haw@@ king impression in front of him .
That &apos;s , obviously , A@@ my &apos;s incredible dress from their wedding .
And Mark Ham@@ ill offici@@ ated .
I do .
Over here , the f@@ encing out@@ fit .
Max , what is that thing that you have behind your back ?
Yes , right here .
No , you &apos;re watching an episode
You do so much with so little fabric .
And I see you too + B@@ 125 : B@@ 130@@ k my advice and got Polish Vog@@ ue .
We are finally on a romantic date .
Y@@ ah , now , he &apos;s going to buy me something golden .
I want a golden shower .
Some place with a lot of cash sho@@ ved up inside you .
Well , let &apos;s see . The wooden base of the cup is about this big ,
That &apos;s like a million dollars !
Well , we . We could have it .
And sold .
Yes , we are .
I &apos;m Ham@@ ish Mc@@ don@@ ough , by the way .
We won &apos;t speak of it ..
And if you ever need anything , don &apos;t hesitate .
&quot; Just the two of us &quot; Anti@@ ques .
No , dear , I &apos;m not ins@@ ane .
This is highly un@@ orthodo@@ x , but I shall repeat the item .
Do I hear 80@@ ,000 ?
80@@ ,000 going once , going twice ,
And the next item up for bid
Kit@@ sch is always a wild card , but it has no real value .
I won that when no one thought I could .
It &apos;s worth something .
We start the bi@@ dding at $ 50 .
Sir , it &apos;s in incre@@ ments of $ 10 .
Sorry , the Rain@@ bow Room really su@@ cked me dry .
Do I hear 60 ?
Ham@@ ish came to play .
Is that why it &apos;s called a loving cup ?
Do I hear 225 ?
I know you have no interest in what I would normally
Look , K@@ ati@@ e Hol@@ mes really wants this ,
200 going once , going twice .
Did you just say &quot; I &apos;m &quot; ?
Ok@@ ay , before we use all this money on the business ,
how many calls ?
how do we know this guy &apos;s
i &apos;ve had some fil@@ thy , fil@@ thy times in this state .
because that &apos;s our only lead on this guy .
there were threats , you and l@@ inc@@ ol@@ n might be kid@@ n@@ apped .
really .
she &apos;d been working in a ma@@ d@@ ag@@ as@@ car rain forest ,
she &apos;s on her way .
why &apos;d this guy call the club &apos;s phone and not er@@ ica &apos;s ?
what do you want with this guy ?
you did good .
oh , no .
my wal@@ let .
we find her , we find our guy .
you keep that up and we &apos;re not going to last here much longer .
he puts four enemies together , guaranteed dis@@ sen@@ sion .
this is our guy &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s address .
this is tia .
someone else &apos;s words heavily par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ased .
i think you meant it as a met@@ aph@@ or .
which ne@@ at@@ ly
from 30 years ago .
just a few convers@@ ations .
I &apos;ve known your mother for years .
I &apos;m gu@@ essing this isn &apos;t about my sense of hum@@ or .
but then she learned the truth .
and if my mother is so brilliant and active in the company ,
it can &apos;t be managed by one person .
equally form@@ id@@ able , working in lock@@ step ?
that &apos;s very good .
m@@ ich@@ ael ..
this is just a st@@ up@@ id girl who dates a criminal .
a signature of bur@@ rows &apos; leadership .
my aim is true , don .
i &apos;ll keep it in my p@@ ants , all right ?
ay@@ e. all right , bur@@ rows is out .
the company &apos;s e-@@ mail@@ ing tia &apos;s credit card history .
a big ol &apos; go@@ ose egg .
i checked her e-@@ mails and her web sites .
are you sure this girlfriend route is the way to go here ?
how long is it gon@@ na take the company
you &apos;re no longer in charge .
bad time ?
the second you stop doing what i tell you to do ,
it &apos;s not gon@@ na be the same .
why ? because two years later it was gone ?
so what are you sug@@ gest@@ ing ,
or wherever you like .
why ,
before you were incar@@ cer@@ ated ,
you &apos;d sit for an hour .
when you &apos;d leave , you &apos;d take a flower
she &apos;s seen the pain you carry .
all right !
the company can &apos;t know i &apos;m talking to you .
do you want to find m@@ ich@@ ael sco@@ field ?
it &apos;s 60 miles northeast
having lem@@ on@@ ade .
that &apos;s how they recru@@ it .
c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine war@@ fare isn &apos;t pretty ,
m@@ ich@@ ael is the object of a quick and n@@ asty
we need the foot@@ age from that security camera .
S@@ ure
A deal &apos;s a deal , right ? not to be a broken record , but all I ask ..
The sco@@ field / bur@@ rows family would have been a form@@ id@@ able asset to the
If , indeed , that &apos;s what we &apos;re dealing with .
Do it now , doctor .
I want sco@@ field p@@ liable for transit .
And if we can &apos;t revi@@ ve him ?
make yourself a hel@@ met , p@@ al .
we pulled his image off the security tape .
that &apos;s great , but that &apos;s going to take all day .
we need to go now .
Th@@ row him a ball or something .
Ok@@ ay , on the count of 3 , C@@ al .
Oh . Ok@@ ay .
What the hell ? !
An angry stomach is 12 % larger .
But they &apos;re un@@ defeated .
Not as long as you &apos;ve been sitting on that couch .
Alex decided to take off some time earlier this summer ,
Did you bring food ?
But they won &apos;t be ready for six weeks .
Well , I fell as@@ le@@ ep on my phone ,
You go back to work in a few weeks .
U@@ h , ok@@ ay . S@@ ure .

Ye@@ ah , I was thinking I might go into baby clothes , actually .
I hear there &apos;s a fort@@ une to be made in baby clothes
And the running people through .
Enjoy it ? You &apos;re brilliant at it !
Do you think so , Number Two ?
You &apos;re more of a pir@@ ate than Black Bell@@ am@@ y or any of them .
That &apos;s why the crew ,
What do you say ?
This is the one , l@@ ads !
Well , don &apos;t just sit there like lem@@ ons !
Standard , si@@ r ?

B@@ old theory .
But to be honest , mon@@ keys are 10 a p@@ enny .
Any@@ how , big day tomorrow .
Let me show you to your room , Captain .
Now , here &apos;s the plan .
Wa@@ it until the be@@ arded idi@@ ot is as@@ le@@ ep ,
Hon@@ est@@ ly , Number Two , what &apos;s got into you ?
Yes , but ...
A future Pir@@ ate of the Year needs his beauty sleep .
That &apos;s lovely . Now , that is lovely .
And just ch@@ u@@ ck in a few g@@ ul@@ ls , would you ?
Give it up for the Pir@@ ate Captain !
No@@ body deser@@ ves this more than you .
And that be@@ ard of yours ,
Give it back , Bell@@ am@@ y , it &apos;s mine !
N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nav@@ el !
You are her@@ eby ban@@ ished from Blood Island !
And stay out !
We don &apos;t need them and their st@@ up@@ id awards .
She gave half of us tet@@ an@@ us , for good@@ ness sake .
Well , you know , you should be happy for her .
E@@ ating gold bri@@ cks wra@@ pped up in , you know , sw@@ ans .

Maybe if we could get through this quick@@ er .
Did you know that ? Fas@@ cin@@ ating .
We should get out of here .
Here &apos;s another interesting fact .
Ah ! Come on . Be@@ at it !
Just a bird , ok@@ ay ? Come on , get moving . Get out of here .
Be@@ at it , bird .
It &apos;s this st@@ up@@ id face you make .

Ye@@ ah ?
I &apos;ve been training four hours a day for six months .
Man , it is hot out here !
Ok@@ ay , ok@@ ay , ok@@ ay .

It means that she &apos;s got a clu@@ e for you .
You got a clu@@ e for her .
She &apos;s your ex-@@ girlfriend . She &apos;s the fl@@ ame .
It &apos;s not the moment for it . For@@ get it .
Look like your stomach is up@@ set .
Oh , man .
Ste@@ aling makes me very un@@ comfortable ,

You &apos;re thinking , how in@@ convenient , how anno@@ ying
Well , exc@@ use me for dying !
It &apos;s bad for your blood pressure .
You don &apos;t care , remember ?

Tell your fu@@ cking pet how long he has !

not for a medical m@@ l@@ rac@@ C e
And I didn &apos;t ?

This has nothing to do with T@@ omm@@ y !
Ball@@ room dancing is not a life choice
Ye@@ ah .
He is patient , kind and here !
I wish you were dead !
Tom@@ p@@ kins and Kan@@ e .
Not possible .
But , no , there &apos;s no need to speed , right ?

Ok@@ ay , so what did we just talk about ?
Brooklyn Dance Academy , dancing that anyone can learn .
It &apos;s Henry Alt@@ mann again . Is T@@ omm@@ y there ?

All in all , the family photos had the decided effect
No . Not really .

Rob@@ yn , you worked real fast here .
Ok@@ ay , ok@@ ay , look .

What &apos;s he got to do with that ?
I feel sc@@ ared when I &apos;m here by myself
It &apos;s made me kind of crazy . I ... &quot; Ye@@ ah .
No , it wasn &apos;t because of the p@@ ills .
Are you sure ?
Are you mixing this stuff with anything ?
Do you want to turn the place up@@ side down like you did the last one ?
If we say sorry to him , we will make this right
Oh , my God .
I mean , if you still believe that he took J@@ ang@@ les , which you do ,
This sh@@ it , it &apos;s over !
The subject is closed .

There &apos;s nothing wrong with success .

Let &apos;s make a spectac@@ le of our own .
Of course . We &apos;d just have an action inside as well .
H@@ old on . How do we actually get in without being caught ?
Un@@ less that &apos;s too organised .

All right . I &apos;ll do it . But this one we do my way .
Well , let &apos;s just say things are gon@@ na get a little loud .
And Nick@@ y &apos;s already dealt with the main gate
This may be the worst idea in the history of the world .

And you know it and you know it !
Ten thir@@ ty-@@ two ? You trying to im@@ press me with numbers ?
I got a number for you : one ,
When I was ten or 11 ,
It was a drinking cup fashi@@ oned from a single piece of j@@ ade .
And it made me look at everything differently .
It was a feeling I had , a complet@@ eness when art touched me .
And you .... what makes you do it ?
It &apos;s always nice to know ...
I &apos;m gon@@ na find this painting .
I just want to hold it .

Inter@@ pol .
The to@@ ad is in the hole .
The fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; huge vag@@ ina is in the border station now .
But , since no crime has been committed , they can &apos;t touch us .
It &apos;s four foot high and star@@ ing you in the face .
They &apos;re going to be watching us , which we need to fix .
Just trust me for a second . Don &apos;t switch the engine on .
You &apos;re being dist@@ rac@@ ted
They stopped following US .
Two minutes away . Come on !
H@@ ey ! H@@ ey ! Here we go . Here we go .
All right , just like the old days .
Or the old days where a one-@@ e@@ yed pir@@ ate ste@@ als my bike ?
OK , but don &apos;t the A@@ mis@@ h ride horse and car@@ ri@@ ages ?
I can &apos;t fu@@ cking do this !
Ye@@ ah , look , Franc@@ ie , it &apos;s not The King &apos;s Spe@@ ech .

Ye@@ ah . H@@ ey , look , som@@ ebo@@ dy &apos;s got to be in Detroit
Do you often feel that your life is just passing you by ?
OK . OK , Franc@@ ie .
I think we can make a lot more money off that Gospel
Great . Par@@ allel . Hot interested
Un@@ cle Pad@@ dy can come up with at least ten more bu@@ yers .
We contact the gallery , we let them know their book is st@@ olen .
Meanwhile we ship off ten copies to ten bu@@ yers .

This is a golden opportunity . I &apos;m not doing this for me .
We &apos;re dro@@ pping this off , we &apos;re making a hell of a dec@@ ent score here .
OK . Where do we find the money to pay for these f@@ akes ?
These f@@ akes would have to stand up to carbon dating
You got a 100 grand la@@ ying around , Nick@@ y ?
You know , I gu@@ ess this is it .
We could have made history .
All right , let &apos;s go down@@ stairs and talk about it .
Ten bu@@ yers , I can find . Maybe more .
Gu@@ y , when can you get started ?
It will take me maybe three weeks ... No , one month .
OK , 100 grand , that &apos;s covered .
Seven hundred , fif@@ ty thousand , minimum .
No . I made the cover for ten grand . The pages are total sh@@ it .
Do we need to carbon date them ?
That &apos;s it , man . Let &apos;s go take it back .
I could come up with about $ 300@@ ,000 .
If there was ever a reason to mortgage your home ..
No , not the house . That &apos;s all I got .
Look , man , I just .... . Look , I don &apos;t know , OK ?
Well , don &apos;t take too long . We don &apos;t have time to lose .
I know what you want .
Ah , Jesus Mur@@ phy .
What can I say ? I &apos;m excited .
So , starting tomorrow , there &apos;ll be no contact .
And L@@ ola will be handling the money .
H@@ a . The Re@@ ver@@ end &apos;s gon@@ na be some p@@ is@@ sed .
Here &apos;s a key to the building .
Gu@@ y &apos;s books will be perfect .
However , your copies , they won &apos;t need any of that carbon dating cra@@ p .
Why bo@@ ther getting all that proper paper for Gu@@ y &apos;s books ?
Because I plan on sending your ten copies of the book
I see . Family &apos;s family , but money &apos;s money , eh ?

What the hell ?
There was blood everywhere .
Wh .. Where are my shoes ?

I was very lucky to have my father singing in the church .
Ph@@ en@@ om@@ en@@ al . Better than mine .
I was singing with my father and 50 more male voice .
1955 , you won first prize in Wales .
That was one of the most important
And that time , I was a teacher for elem@@ entary school .
He knows how difficult it is , even with a beautiful voice .
So , in 1955 , I begin to study ,
I won a competition ,
I remember that we have the room , one in front of the other ,
It &apos;s everything po@@ etic and romantic and positive in life .
London is an incredible city ,
But to become a ten@@ or , that &apos;s another thing . It &apos;s more un@@ natural .
That &apos;s the most important thing .
When I was listening to Luci@@ ano , you know ,
I felt like I could see his voice .
You can count molecules practically . It &apos;s so clear .
There &apos;s such tension of sound . My ears would ring .
Luci@@ ano was the one and only . Yes .
When I was born in this building ,
M@@ v mother emb@@ rac@@ ed me , and with all the women of this house ,
I was very much spo@@ iled , loved , but even .. kept smart .
Ti@@ b@@ or made a career with Luci@@ ano , taking him into sta@@ di@@ ums ,
He said , &quot; Any@@ thing you do from here on in ,
He was bran@@ ching out .
I feel ... It &apos;s almost ... The feeling is that , eh ?
I thought they will have arguments who will sing which aria .
So we all re@@ hear@@ sed it on the spot .
So , we divi@@ de some of the numbers .
I think a good way to know a person
U@@ h , the moment of being on the stage ,
.. spirit of the moment , you know ?
But , u@@ h , we end the program ,
It was like a ti@@ dal wave .
All of a sudden , classical departments
It &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ sting .
Well , he was the most famous Catholic
So they would de@@ vote quite a lot of the paper to it .
These days ,
There is no respect .
I should &apos;ve said , &quot; You are wa@@ sting time . &quot;
It was bad because , u@@ h , I was suffering myself .
But they understand that I fell in love .
And now falling in love ... .. he caught it in the neck again .
A@@ w , je@@ ez .
Wa@@ it . T@@ oh@@ n .
Ye@@ ah . John , Am@@ ber &apos;s almost as tall as me .
Ye@@ ah , I know . She &apos;s cute as hell , right ?
The girl sitting up@@ stairs ?
John , Shel@@ ly &apos;s short .
God dam@@ n it . I knew she was too good to be true .
John and I are having a bit of a problem here .
Now John here has ey@@ es@@ ight problems
The &quot; check engine &quot; light is fine . It &apos;s still blin@@ king away .
It cost me like $ 1,@@ 200 to fix it .
Yes , it occurs to me , too .

Penn@@ y , you appear to have a package here .
This must be the ber@@ et I ordered .
Did you know the ber@@ et is an example

Kind of like a pupp@@ y .

You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes ,

Because i thought that we had something .
If you &apos;re just sleeping around ,
Because i don &apos;t have 75 bu@@ cks
And i am exhau@@ sted , ari@@ zona .
Six people died on my watch today ,
I thou@@ gh@@ t. i thought that last night

You saved that girl today as much asi did .
You don &apos;t have to be the hero you just .
Alex ...
You &apos;re gon@@ na be flying solo today .
She &apos;ll be fine .
And now , ladies and gentlemen ...
Wo@@ w . Look at all those drawings .
I think we &apos;re all a little ar@@ ts@@ y .

Right ?

Do you see where she &apos;s got ..
Ye@@ ah .
Ok@@ ay .
All right , there you go .
I want to try a primary res@@ ection on Daniel
Alex .
But can the child even with@@ stand ?
I would think that you of all people ..
would fight for a woman to get paid at least as much as any man .
I mean , if you do not value her enough , then just ...
She deser@@ ves more , and you know it .
You don &apos;t know . I am woman .
But I &apos;ve already ment@@ ored Grey .
And now that I &apos;m chief of this hospital ,
Let &apos;s get you out of here .
Thank you for not changing the lo@@ cks .
Maybe you &apos;re right .
But is it really crazy to try like hell to save
When you &apos;re faced with the tough choices ,
What can you leave behind ?
Any@@ thing else you need ?
Ok@@ ay .
There &apos;s still a lot of ep@@ i@@ dur@@ al ble@@ eding .

Is this a better time ?
I just wanted to remind you
You have to understand .
Our residents really respond to these events .
I think it &apos;s important you attend .
I mean , we never said , &quot; We have rules , &quot;
You &apos;re a hand@@ ful enough as it is ,
You see ? There &apos;s nothing to worry about .
We should .
Just for the record ...
I bet you do .
I just need to se@@ w up the per@@ for@@ ation on the bl@@ ad@@ der wall .
Well , you said this man &apos;s wife is pregnant ?
It is .. they &apos;re what hold back the ur@@ ine and the f@@ eces .
It &apos;ll only make you feel worse .
You should know I had nothing to do with that .
I mean , that &apos;s what &apos;s important .
Ye@@ ah . You know , it &apos;s like when St@@ an Lee and Steve D@@ it@@ ko
Even though St@@ an Lee gets to be in all the Mar@@ vel movies .

That &apos;s not helping .
Stu@@ art , we &apos;re here .
Ye@@ ah , well , I tried putting him out on the cur@@ b ,
What happened ?

Should we tell everyone not to come ?
Ok@@ ay . Well , I &apos;ll keep it together if you can .
I &apos;m not making any promises !
Of course .
It &apos;s not you . It &apos;s this place that &apos;s making you crazy .
I mean , you need to get out of town , clear your head .
My parents would never let me do that .
And I already took his car , so ...
I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea , because ..
And I pass out .

That &apos;s what I get from Bruce .
1959 , when I was 18 .
He beat this k@@ id up , but he did@@ nt know
If he wanted his immigration status to be US citizen ,
In Seattle , my father started teaching mar@@ tial arts .
If you had a sinc@@ ere interest in mar@@ tial arts ,
Bruce used to come to my high school
It wasn &apos;t long after that
We would get together on campus
And it was like ,
I mean , it was very difficult .
The ban on inter@@ racial marriage was lifted in 1968 .
I don &apos;t care how good you are , 13@@ 5@@ 1@@ b w@@ rest@@ ler
But the fact is , it wasn &apos;t about mass .
But , then again ,
You got the job on The Green Hor@@ net ,
And it &apos;s a h@@ eck of a name , man .
Mr Rei@@ d &apos;s residence .
We could care less about Te@@ en Hor@@ net .
Every@@ body in the neighbourhood was fighting to be Bruce Lee ,
You do the old John Wa@@ yne ,
There &apos;s a shot of Bruce and he &apos;s doing a k@@ ick ,
There were all these seas@@ oned actors doing their thing ,
When I did The Green Hor@@ net , I was not being myself
By the way , I did a really terrible job in that , I have to say .
He was always trying to be a holi@@ stic person ,
And he was a very liter@@ ate guy .
All type of knowledge ultimately means self-@@ knowledge .
Any book I &apos;d pick up , there were not@@ ations about
what was functional , what was no good !
Most of the writ@@ ings in the
He might have changed &quot; F@@ igh@@ ter &quot; From &quot; F@@ enc@@ er , &quot; but
It sounds Chinese but it &apos;s very much an American mar@@ tial art .
The philosophy Bruce Lee had was :
It can be taught .
But it cannot really be stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed .
But it was very personal to him .
J@@ K@@ D in 1970 will be different . &quot;
You talk about Chinese bo@@ xing .
Well , first we use the feet .
And then we use the el@@ bow .
Do you use the th@@ umb too ?
Because that is the expression of the human body .
The crazy thing about mar@@ tial
Bruce Lee is definitely the father of mixed mar@@ tial arts .
If D@@ ana White says Bruce Lee is the father of mixed mar@@ tial arts ,
As I was cho@@ king him ,
Gene Le@@ Bell taught Bruce Lee gra@@ p@@ pling moves .
Then had a spin , do a c@@ res@@ cent k@@ ick on me
If you &apos;re gon@@ na say father of mixed mar@@ tial ...
He &apos;s the first one who decided to put it all together
They say that Bruce Lee was the father of mixed mar@@ tial arts .
If he &apos;s the father of mixed mar@@ tial arts
When you get into this whole mar@@ tial arts thing
But Bruce Lee is 100 percent the father of mixed mar@@ tial arts .
It &apos;s really heavy and it says ,
I think the successful ingredient in it
My@@ self , right .
He was very proud of Long@@ street , and it was very much from him
He &apos;s one of my students .
Yes .
But there were some lines there expressed your philosophy .
I remember .
I said empty your mind .
Like water .
Put water into a bottle , it becomes the bottle .
Now , water can flow or cre@@ ep or dri@@ p or crash .
Like that . You see ?
That was .. It was made
He &apos;s from the land . He &apos;s one of the folk .
And this is why it was so
It &apos;s about making violence look beautiful
But the Western movies really p@@ iss me off .
In three months he was sw@@ ing@@ ing
Every gang@@ ster in town had nun@@ ch@@ ak@@ us ,
In a short time I think almost every child is using this .
It &apos;s out@@ law@@ ed now in California .
But I always hit my el@@ bow .
And I hit my head
I tried to make my parents
I had the rubber ones . So I &apos;m good .
I carried a gun for years .
I think I went into therapy and I thought ,
They &apos;re ready to film , have all this crew ,
Bruce knew what he wanted Dragon to be ,
It was kind of hard around
If he didn &apos;t like anything you did , he would tell you .
She knew how to talk to him and coun@@ sel him .
It was a coming together , and ,
Don &apos;t think . Re@@ el .
Action .
Bruce Lee is explo@@ sive in a way that no one had seen before .
You see a lot of complex emotions all going on at once .
The mirror scene was just , you know , when he &apos;s walking around
you defeat the enemy
This was Bruce Lee &apos;s film in Hollywood .
I was called and came to the hospital .
It was a cer@@ eb@@ ral o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ,
The doctors were very re@@ ass@@ uring .
He didn &apos;t have frequent head@@ aches .
I had seen him in June .
He was not wor@@ ried about
He &apos;s on the ver@@ ge of star@@ dom in the United States
It &apos;s the kind of problem
So eventually the am@@ bul@@ ance arrived . It took a long time .
He got to the hospital and I saw him la@@ ying there
It j@@ ammed before it made it to market .
You guys said something about body parts ?
It was mixed in with a lot of sh@@ red@@ ded stuff ,
G@@ ot to be some mistake .
Electronics , appliances , appar@@ el ,
No . We don &apos;t sh@@ red people .
Well , we &apos;ve got cameras everywhere .
Some@@ one so much as gets a paper cut ,
We need to take a look at it .
Plus we &apos;re going to need to see what your &quot; E@@ yes &quot; Sa@@ w :
You can , u@@ h , sh@@ red it when we &apos;re done .
They fill them up at their offices ,
Like I said , no one fell in .
if I was going to get rid of a body ,
Ye@@ ah . L@@ ooks like we &apos;re in for a long day .
Ye@@ ah , as my recent brush with T-@@ Re@@ x confirms ,
Ye@@ ah .
I know what you need , H .
Ye@@ ah .
All right , guys , we got paper , plastic , metal ,
Always a del@@ ight .
Well , I enjoy a good puzzle now and again ,
Ho@@ dges opened his big mouth .
Can we , u@@ h ... get to the go@@ o ?
We &apos;ll see what we get .
Weight of the parts suggests that
Put your nose down the scope .
Well , a portion of the cran@@ ial bone
More than thinking . I also found this .
It stuck around .
We &apos;ll run everything through bal@@ li@@ sti@@ cs ,
No way !
Well , y@@ e@@ ah , if it &apos;s the Lar@@ ry L@@ al@@ otte .
&quot; How much would you pay for peace of mind ?
For a monthly fee ,
Since when do you worry about identity the@@ ft ?
All we are is zer@@ oes and ones .
I &apos;m Lar@@ ry L@@ al@@ otte .
How much would you pay for ... ?
Yes .
I &apos;m dead ?
Bet@@ ter-@@ looking , too , right ?
You got something to sell ,
Wes@@ ley . Works in the mail@@ room .
So , gentlemen , what about this dead thing ?
Some@@ one had forc@@ e-@@ fed him credit cards .
My name ? !
And the next thing I know , I got loans taken out in my name ,
You got an ali@@ bi ?
Thanks to Lar@@ ry La@@ Mot@@ te , there &apos;s a half do@@ zen guys
Ye@@ ah .
Those are my numbers on my computer .
There are plenty of leg@@ it companies doing this , but .
Ye@@ ah .
And you need one , so you figure , why not ?
Ho@@ dges ..
Oh , of course not , no .
So , the older frag@@ ment is from a different gun .
How ?
It shows signs of en@@ cap@@ s@@ ulation .
So far , we have nothing to identify our sh@@ red@@ der guy .
No@@ body &apos;s perfect . Kind of looks like a Chi@@ a P@@ et .
W@@ eren &apos;t able to pull a print , though ?
M@@ ight get something now .
Julius Kap@@ lan and a John Do@@ e in an al@@ ley
And then k@@ ills him with a G@@ lock .
Two crimes , same sho@@ oter ?
It doesn &apos;t make sense , Catherine .
So , why would an identity th@@ ief come all the way to Vegas
Maybe he just wanted a free trip to Vegas on Lar@@ ry &apos;s di@@ me .
Ei@@ ther way , something else is going on .
&quot; Why kill a p@@ enn@@ y-@@ ante th@@ ief ? &quot;
Fac@@ ial recognition got a hit on Sh@@ red@@ der Gu@@ y .
Check out the name .
The real Lar@@ ry La@@ Mot@@ te .
See this car@@ tri@@ dge case ?
It has all the personal information we need to identify you .
Bur@@ gl@@ ary , fraud , and identity the@@ ft .
Hello , Ar@@ lo Kar@@ den .
Step away from the car .
That &apos;s what they say .
The all-@@ knowing executive assistant .
You knew the real Lar@@ ry .
You knew about your b@@ oss with@@ drawing five million bu@@ cks .
Sa@@ w an opportunity for a little qu@@ id pro qu@@ o .
Just like my b@@ oss .
Exc@@ ept then , it was about holding on to my job .
&quot; Hon@@ ey , can you pick up my dry cleaning &quot; ?
I need a little help with something . &quot;
He confirms someone accessed one of his accounts .
And with five million dollars missing , well ..
And thanks to I.@@ D-@@ Pres@@ erve ,
Ex@@ ac@@ tly .
M@@ m . My mother wouldn &apos;t appro@@ ve ;
It &apos;s just so hard to tell what will look good on me .
You know , do-@@ do you want something simple and elegant ?
O@@ oh , we &apos;re talking about trains .
I def@@ y you to name a train that I don &apos;t like .
I did not see that coming . Good job .
What should I wear ?
How much money are you asking for ?
Then I &apos;d go no bra .
I have figured out an experimental design
Just no@@ d .
I mean , they won &apos;t even give me that much
But I need it . It &apos;s the only way to sett@@ le the contradic@@ tions
Well , what if I ask for it in six easy install@@ ments
So , u@@ h , what do you say ?
He said no ?
You &apos;re gon@@ na have to double down .
Hig@@ gs had to wait almost 50 years
But I want to play with it now .
Take that , M@@ om .
Is it possible that the very first dress is the dress ?
You can &apos;t buy the first dress you try on .
Ok@@ ay , well , you know ,
It &apos;s never felt the touch of a man before .
Of course I don &apos;t want to sell these .
Ok@@ ay . U@@ h , why don &apos;t you leave these here with me ,
S@@ ure .
H@@ ey , I can &apos;t believe you just thre@@ w me under the bus .
Well ...
If &apos;s ... It &apos;s w@@ ow .
I loved the mac@@ ar@@ oni neckl@@ ace he made me in first grade .
People are gon@@ na think I played for the Kn@@ icks in the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
It &apos;s 100 % Class .
All right .
So , I &apos;ve nar@@ ro@@ wed it down to Swiss Coffee
I thought we land@@ ed on eg@@ g@@ shell .
W-@@ Why don &apos;t we just sell the house ?
You were at that science fair .
This is for our L@@ ily .
&quot; L@@ ily is testing
We &apos;re just deci@@ ding if she &apos;s gon@@ na ski@@ p a grade .
Well , no , choices have consequences .
Ok@@ ay , why do all your mel@@ t@@ down@@ s
I am ...
He gave me b@@ ang@@ s .
Hop@@ efully you &apos;re all cri@@ ed out .
D@@ ad , we got to start getting ready for the gradu@@ ation .
Do you guys remember that &quot; Luke Lo@@ ves D@@ ad@@ dy &quot; ra@@ p ?
D@@ ad , please , you really got to stop .
M@@ ama , now my to@@ oth hur@@ ts .
What if it &apos;s my leg ?
As a matter of fact , I am .
He loves din@@ osau@@ rs ,
Oh , do you have to go so soon ?
Ye@@ ah , you &apos;re like two s@@ ni@@ ffs away from a fel@@ ony .
I gave Phi@@ l such a hard time
Luke used to love coming here .
The one outside is yours ?
The girl that was sitting on Mann@@ y &apos;s lap
and he teaches Mann@@ y how to be a dog !
H@@ ey , look at me ! I &apos;m about to talk to a stran@@ ger !
U@@ gh . It wasn &apos;t this de@@ pressing last night .
Exc@@ use me .
This is a fun game , isn &apos;t it ? But you know what ?
Con@@ grat@@ ulations on the first
Thanks for helping me with the cap@@ -@@ and-@@ g@@ own m@@ ess .
Got@@ cha .
I learned how to fight .
Social Services came when I was 12 years old and took me away .
Ye@@ ah , he kind of remin@@ ds me
Good times , right ?
I know . It &apos;s not your job to save her .
I can &apos;t get reception on this thing
We do this all the time .
We &apos;re gon@@ na have a fu@@ cking cir@@ cus on our hands .
What are we gon@@ na do ?
Dr. Ray , please pick up line two .
I &apos;m really tired of everybody let@@ ting me down all the time .
I mean ..
And if anyone doesn &apos;t appreciate that ,
That &apos;s very sweet .
l know a short@@ cut .
There are many ways for trage@@ dy and violence
They can grow weak , they can grow strong .
What other side is that ?
You understand ? We do this one thing .
One fu@@ cking thing , Jim@@ my .
Are we good ?
Fu@@ cking hands in the air , mo@@ ther@@ fu@@ cker !
Mo@@ ve it ! Open the go@@ d@@ dam@@ n safe !
T@@ aking risks for what ? For money .
That &apos;s right .
I would &apos;ve done the same thing .
Living all these years , just th@@ an@@ king people .
Th@@ an@@ king a priest for his bl@@ ess@@ ings .
Th@@ an@@ king God .
Gary won &apos;t sign my petition unless I sign his .
Where were we ?
I got the power suit , the corner office .
But one important decision ,
I sing . I saw you singing
Write what you care about , what you &apos;re afraid of .
Is that what you write about ? The truth ?
Mo@@ stly to God .
I &apos;m writing one right now for a girl , and this girl , man , she is ..
Write what you love , y@@ e@@ ah ? Get after it .
I &apos;ve been listening to this G@@ inny O@@ wen@@ s song
has chosen something bigger for me ,
I am so sc@@ ared .
If one person &apos;s life is changed by what I go through ...
Look , man . I should &apos;ve told you .
Which means I have a lot of time to think
Ancient stories , still relevant and true .
Yet to another , His call is to suffer , and even die
Each is the stroke of a brush on His beautiful canvas .
And I think I &apos;m one of those lucky people
It led to the perfect day with you .
And God is worth tru@@ sting .
All right , you may talk in the bedroom ,
But keep in mind I &apos;ll be right out here
Leon@@ ard , when you get this message , call me .
When you get this , tell Leon@@ ard to check his vo@@ ic@@ email .
Because you &apos;re welcome to .
who I can and can &apos;t have a relationship with .
The Hind@@ u Code of Man@@ u is very clear in these matters .
The code also states
We believe this stuff .
Some of it makes sense , some of it &apos;s crazy .
Who can &apos;t go out with Leon@@ ard ?
Penn@@ y , this is Ra@@ i &apos;s sister , Pri@@ ya .
Oh . Then perhaps you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s going on .
Ar@@ gu@@ ably much more suitable than you .
H@@ ey , what do you mean , &quot; More suitable &quot; ?
I &apos;m doing research on emotions and brain activity .
Then I &apos;m going to stim@@ ulate the an@@ alog@@ ous area
I choose you .
Y@@ ep . I moved out of my mother &apos;s house .
What did she say when you told her ?
This is so great .
You got all the talent in the world and all you w@@ anna do is m@@ ess around .
to help bring our product into the city .
Three b@@ ins a month .
and all they got@@ ta do is make sure they pass through without inspection .
Her@@ o@@ in .
The very best in the world .
Very interested .
Tw@@ enty years ago , I made a living , the same way we all did .
.. but mostly I was a grin@@ der .
You know what that but@@ cher shop ts to@@ day@@ &apos;
Why are you telling me this ?
I am a legitimate business@@ man now .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m here .
Who@@ a , wh@@ oa , wh@@ oa . H@@ ey , h@@ ey . Wa@@ it ! Come on , now .
Take the night to think it over . Once you &apos;ve considered it more carefully ..
Everyone I came up with is either dead
It &apos;s Christ@@ mas@@ time
Take this sh@@ it with you .
We paid you to guarantee your father &apos;s support .
I &apos;ll be st@@ opping by your house ton@@ ight to pick up our money .
Fu@@ cking g@@ arb@@ age . I hate Alban@@ ians .
Did you even listen to what he had to say ?
Sh@@ ut your mouth . I &apos;m talking to my father .
The problem is , all I ever hear out of your mouth ..
And now I bring you a piece of business , a good piece of business
When I was younger ..
I made so much money bringing co@@ ca@@ ine into the city
until I couldn &apos;t recognize them anymore .
Not enough money in the world to pull me back in .
I can &apos;t just walk away .
o@@ int Ple@@ as@@ ant .
You were in this one with ..
Mau@@ re@@ en Gal@@ vin
You get enough to eat ?
This is detention , not art class .
O@@ i ! Alex El@@ li@@ ot !
Where are you going ? Don &apos;t run away .
Go , go ! Run , get him !
We &apos;re right behind you !
Alex El@@ li@@ ot !
H@@ ey , L@@ ance ! I &apos;ve got him .
You and me have got a fight to finish .
Hello ? Is any@@ body here ?
Come across the garden walls .
The sword has returned .
The sword has been drawn .
Sens@@ es .
E@@ yes and ears .
Find the new king .
The king . The new king . Find the new king .
Maybe it &apos;s a p@@ rank .
Maybe there were hidden cameras .
There &apos;s something written on the guard .
What just happened ?
We have a new pup@@ il joining the class today .
Gre@@ etings , young academ@@ icians . My name is ...
Go away .
Leave us alone !
And this boy among you drew Exc@@ ali@@ b@@ ur .
Stop it ! Stop that !
Dan@@ ielle said they tried to catch it for two hours ,
Mor@@ tes Mill@@ es ? Is that what came to get me last night ?
Their souls ens@@ la@@ ved by evil .
But ...
Their sp@@ ell is only broken at sun@@ rise .
is destroyed .
That &apos;s why everything went back to normal after you left .
Exc@@ ali@@ b@@ ur .
She was King Arthur &apos;s half-@@ sister .
Men &apos;s hearts have grown hol@@ low .
And that is why the sword has returned .
That &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous . I &apos;m 12 .
You &apos;ll have to find someone else .
So , there &apos;s your sword back .
Your qu@@ est has been decided .
You must find the entrance to the Under@@ world .
You have been chosen
If I have to transform into my adult self
The path you choose must be your own .
This is the worst and best
Some@@ where we can think .
See ? N@@ one of this happened by accident .
This was meant to be .
How del@@ u@@ ded they are .
Sir L@@ ance , Lady Ka@@ ye .
Do us a favor , Mer@@ tin .
That &apos;s hardly the attitude of a k@@ night , young man .
Don &apos;t tell me you &apos;ve never heard of the Chi@@ val@@ ric Code .
The Code is the cor@@ ner@@ stone of a civili@@ zed society ,
What the hell is he on about ?
Short@@ cut .
H@@ alt !
The Chi@@ val@@ ric Code is the set of rules
Bre@@ ak any of these rules from the moment the sword was drawn ,
O@@ i ! Mini Mer@@ lin ! What are you doing ?
Indeed , we are not .
Was it a temple ? A bur@@ ial ground ?
St@@ on@@ eh@@ enge is a transport hub .
U@@ h , exc@@ use me !
H@@ ey , wait ! Security ! Security !
You see ? They &apos;re all linked .
Bu@@ ilt as a magical conv@@ ey@@ ance system ,
A simple duplic@@ ation sp@@ ell
I do magic tri@@ cks for a hob@@ by ,
I &apos;ll be most impressed if you succeed .
So , let us begin .
Use this to your advantage .
N@@ or can they use its weight to ha@@ sten their speed .
Be bra@@ ve and resol@@ ute .
It must be the Code .
I spoke the truth at all times .
&quot; Hon@@ or those you love . &quot;
How could you do this ?
I &apos;ve been wor@@ ried sick .
M@@ um , I &apos;ve got something to tell you .
I met my A@@ unt S@@ ophie .
I know you lied to me about the book .
he didn &apos;t even sign it .
Quick@@ ly now .
My name is Alexander El@@ li@@ ot .
Then I found out it wasn &apos;t just any sword in a stone ,
I know , I know , I know it sounds ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous ,
And if you don &apos;t believe me ,
Gu@@ iet . Qu@@ iet . Listen .
Then you must destroy her so that she can never return .
We can do it , Mer@@ lin .
We have to do it .
This is it . Good luck .
They &apos;re through the gates .
Now ! Go ! Go ! Go !
Amazon Expedition , day seven .
we &apos;ve reached the center of the rain@@ forest .
strug@@ gling for survival
with the last remaining family living under protection .
We &apos;re famous !
And if there is , we will find them and protect them .
Hi , Lin@@ da !
All this time , I thought ..
H@@ ey , it has@@ n &apos;t been all bad .
But just imagine if there was a whole flo@@ ck of us .
We got@@ ta do something .
Ye@@ ah , we have to fly to the Amazon and help Lin@@ da and Tu@@ lio find them !
Why not ?
We &apos;re not people , we &apos;re birds .
They need this . We need this .
T don &apos;t know
Ye@@ ah !
Wa@@ it . What &apos;s the Amazon ?

And if there is , we will find them and protect them .
That would be me . Ok@@ ay , everybody can go home now .
H@@ ey , big bird ! Bre@@ ak a leg !

Ye@@ ah , along with a b@@ unch of notes I never heard of
You catch my dri@@ ft ?

All right , bird . P@@ ick a fort@@ une .

According to my little friend here , this boat will get us there by morning .
Two million square miles of jung@@ le ..

And that &apos;s why you
The rest of you , go cut some trees .
For years , we have been on the run
A place we can finally put down roots .

No@@ body leaves the tri@@ be .

We already are super@@ -@@ meg@@ a-@@ d@@ ope , but .
Thank you , but we &apos;re fine .
Real estate must be pretty cheap around here .
This old nest ? It &apos;s just something I put together last minute .
And my strength .
I can bar@@ ely look at it . You got@@ ta lose that human pocket , ok@@ ay ?
&quot; F@@ anny pack . &quot; Ad@@ orable

You look familiar . Don &apos;t I know you from somewhere ?

Well , at first I was afraid
Oh , no !
We &apos;ll see you at the performance tomorrow night .

Instead of ch@@ asing that bird all over the jung@@ le ..

It will be a performance ...
It only works when I do it .
H@@ ey , swe@@ e@@ tie , there you are . What &apos;s taking you so long ?
The whole tri@@ be &apos;s gathering to watch the sun@@ set . Come on .
They are Just on the other side of the gro@@ ve
but I &apos;m sure if he met them , he would change his mind .
Ye@@ ah , Bl@@ u ...
But I thought that was our plan .
You know , maybe some places sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be found .
She ate a bug . A bug !
Cal@@ m down ? We had a plan .
But when I mentioned it to her , she completely shut me down .
He &apos;s got this wei@@ rd thing about humans !
A pet ?
I can &apos;t believe he used the &quot; P &apos; word to my face .
He &apos;s not one of us , Rober@@ to . Keep an eye on him .
He is always ho@@ ver@@ ing around Je@@ wel . He is always singing something
Try to see this place through her eyes .
That &apos;s Just n@@ asty , thinking about it .
I &apos;m sorry . Sorry .
G@@ litter is absolutely essential for a magical performance .
Gu@@ ys !
Ring a bell ? Come on . You &apos;re coming , right , D@@ ad ?
That girl put the &quot; business &quot; in &quot; show business . &quot;
What a gl@@ orious morning !
No , no . Don &apos;t do it
Finally !
This is my most important tool .
I gu@@ ess old Ed@@ die &apos;s rules don &apos;t apply to everyone .
I didn &apos;t know that . Sorry .
You come over here , take our food .
No , no , no . This is all just a big mis@@ understanding .
You seem like a nice bird
I hope you don &apos;t mind .
L@@ ol@@ li@@ pop ?
Jet &apos;s see if it will return the favor .
A new player is coming off the ben@@ ch . Is he a secret weapon ?
H@@ ey , I &apos;m open !
H@@ ey , pass to me , I &apos;m open . I &apos;m wide open !
Thanks for the pass , Bl@@ u !
Pass the ball ! Pass the ball !
No , this bird &apos;s got it covered .
It looks like the secret weapon just back@@ fired !
I &apos;m gon@@ na kill you , f@@ anny pack !
We &apos;re gon@@ na be talking about that for a long time
What happened back there ?
We still got it , Bl@@ u !
H@@ ey ! Get away from that !
L@@ ol@@ li@@ pop ?
What are you doing ? Let go !
Come on , let go !
And no psycho@@ -@@ on-@@ wheels is gon@@ na change that .
He &apos;d better not show his face around here ever again .
The last time I spoke to Or@@ son ,
And I should have done something .
Is that for me ? Ah@@ em .
H@@ ey , I know this tri@@ ck , and if I let you open it today ,
And I am totally gon@@ na fall for it .
Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t you w@@ anna finish our conversation ?
You had to get the girls a cat , didn &apos;t you ?
H@@ ey , that is medi@@ cally veri@@ fied .
Oh , how could I say &quot; no &quot; to such sad
Kit@@ ty , f@@ etch .

Hello .
Oh , my god . It is a gun .
Sus@@ an , don &apos;t fre@@ ak out .
S@@ it down .
What does that tell ya ?
I don &apos;t want to die alone . B@@ ree .
I don &apos;t want to waste away in some hospital bed .
All right .
Oh , and by &quot; help him out , &quot; he means
Do you know it &apos;s illegal to ass@@ ault someone ?
I tried to get him to leave , he thre@@ w a p@@ unch ,
I &apos;m starting to think that a tie
You &apos;re not nervous about your first day back , are you ?
I just thought I &apos;d be more excited than I am .
You want excit@@ ement , sha@@ ke things up .
Ok@@ ay .
Just making sure I &apos;m in the memory book .
I &apos;m her mother . Maybe you &apos;re the inv@@ ader .
I spent weeks planning this party ,
Well , stop for@@ ging . You &apos;re not family .
&quot; Se@@ eing . &quot;
Well ...
What does that mean ?
I have to understand it .
I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m still trying to understand it .
Of course not ,
And what &apos;s so important about this ?
Out ? At this hour of the morning ?
Where did she go ? She &apos;s always out these days .
I &apos;m sorry .. ?
It &apos;s a family tra@@ it .
If you continue like this , si@@ r ,
I &apos;m still inc@@ lined to four .
Yes , you &apos;re right . I &apos;m changing my bet to three years ,
I understand your dis@@ approval , Wat@@ son ,
You &apos;re gam@@ bling with your own life ?
Lady Car@@ m@@ ich@@ ael &apos;s case , what is it ?
I never really say that .
And you &apos;ve solved it already , I assume ?
But the Bri@@ de , Hol@@ mes ,
You am@@ a@@ ze me , Wat@@ son .
Since when have you had any kind of imagination ?
Yes , now you come to mention it , that was quite impressive .
Save those we make for ourselves .
G@@ hosts we make for ourselves , what do you mean ?
It &apos;s a common enough condition .
The whole thing was a .... bad dream .
Well , that &apos;s a gro@@ tes@@ que jo@@ ke .
She married you .
I &apos;ll do my best to save your life ton@@ ight ,
Yes . In detail , please .
Inter@@ esting . I didn &apos;t mention she was a woman .
You will not .
Well , you tried .
Good afternoon .
What was that ?
All the doors and windows of the house will be locked .
H@@ mm , it &apos;s difficult to say quite what he &apos;ll do .
Gu@@ ilt ? About what ?
Not a jo@@ ke ?
Orange pi@@ ps are a traditional warning of av@@ eng@@ ing death ,
Some@@ thing to do with E@@ mel@@ ia Ric@@ ol@@ etti ?
We all have a past , Wat@@ son . G@@ hosts .
Sir Eu@@ st@@ ace knows he &apos;s a marked man .
You think so ?
On the contrary , I have no view on the matter .
Mar@@ riage is not a subject upon which I d@@ well .
What &apos;s the matter with you this evening ?
From a retired army sur@@ geon , most certainly .
I conc@@ ede it .
Please don &apos;t .
What did you just say ?
About a note , what did you just say ?
No , they didn &apos;t .
Why do you make him tea ?
He said , &quot; There &apos;s only one susp@@ ect , &quot; and then he just walks away
Sa@@ id it was so simple I could solve it .
I &apos;d be offen@@ ded if you didn &apos;t .
I like your rooms .
man@@ ly .
Well , you are always away ,
Do you have to pose ... during your de@@ duc@@ tions ?
To dist@@ rac@@ t me , der@@ ail me .
Has@@ n &apos;t this all happened before ?
What was it ? What was that case ?
For the sake of Mrs Hu@@ dson &apos;s wallpaper , I must remind you
Dead ... is the new sexy .
How can you be alive ?
You can be honest , is it notic@@ eable ?
Well , a somewhat shorter ex@@ ile
What ?
What on earth are you talking about ?
Ric@@ ol@@ etti and his ab@@ om@@ in@@ able wife ! Don &apos;t you understand ? !
It was a case , a famous one from 100 years ago .
What , like M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty ?
But you &apos;ve only just been told .
Yes ? So ? It &apos;s been five minutes since My@@ cro@@ ft called .
More to the point , what have YO@@ U been doing ?
Of course .
Oh , Sher@@ lock .
I was there , all of it , everything . I was immer@@ sed .
Do you really think anyone is belie@@ ving you ?
The M@@ ind Palace , it &apos;s like a whole world in his head .
The M@@ ind Palace is a memory technique , I know what it can do
Oh , there are .
You &apos;ve put on weight .
Stop this ! Just stop it ! Did you make a list ? !
Everything , Sher@@ lock . Everything you &apos;ve taken .
I &apos;ve seen him do it .
Wher@@ ever I find him ,
I &apos;m not an ad@@ dict , I &apos;m a user .
For God &apos;s sake ! This could kill you !
Control@@ led usage is not usually fat@@ al
E@@ mel@@ ia Ric@@ ol@@ etti , I &apos;m looking her up .
I have access to the top level of the MI@@ 5 archive .
What do you think of MI@@ 5 security ?
E@@ mel@@ ia Ric@@ ol@@ etti , &quot; Un@@ solved , &quot;
I have to go back .
&quot; Y@@ apping ? &quot; Sorry , did we interrup@@ t your session ?
Mr Hol@@ mes asked me .
No , not him , the cle@@ ver one .
My theory is that Mrs Ric@@ ol@@ etti had help .
Bra@@ vo , Mary . &quot; The cle@@ ver one ? &quot;
Well , you &apos;re the one who moved out .
You &apos;re working for My@@ cro@@ ft ?
And he had a sp@@ y to hand . Has it never occurred to you
When did it occur to you ?
M@@ ust be difficult ,
Yes , all right . What &apos;s all this about ?
Why don &apos;t we go and find out .
All that remained was to sub@@ stitute the real Mrs. Ric@@ ol@@ etti
But why would she do that ?
Every great cause has mart@@ yr@@ s .
One half of the human race at war with the other .
Not allowed so much as a vote .
To put right an in@@ justice as old as humanity itself .
This is a war we must lose .
Who was ?
There were clear signs of consumption -
Left her abandoned and p@@ enn@@ il@@ ess .
Hol@@ mes .
Why do you never mention me , si@@ r ?
Yes .
Even with my resources .
I don &apos;t get it , how is this relevant ?
You mean how M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty did it ?
But none of that really happened , it was in your head .
I don &apos;t know what you think you &apos;ll find here .
Mrs Ric@@ ol@@ etti was buried here ,
They &apos;d move it , of course they would .
Well , not here .
The con@@ spir@@ ators had someone on the inside .
You &apos;re not seriously going to do this ?
Sp@@ o@@ ken like an ad@@ dict .
No , this is you ne@@ eding a fix .
M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty &apos;s back .
Get@@ ting to that , it &apos;s next on the list .
No , everyone always lets you do whatever you want .
John , please ..
When you &apos;re ready to go to work , give me a call .
You &apos;re what ?
No ...
At any rate , it was a very long time ago .
M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty ? Back from the dead ?
Look at that guy in the ch@@ ute .
where we have got local hero Luke Coll@@ ins
He &apos;s a three-@@ time P@@ B@@ R World Fin@@ als champion .
But he &apos;s back
You ready for this ?

T@@ s that what R@@ uth would want ?
Did you read my letters ?
But yet , with my most important student .
R@@ uth has fallen in love with contemporary art .
I don &apos;t think it stopped . But it &apos;s taken a long n@@ ap .
and they grow up and think for themselves .
It &apos;s trage@@ dy !
Nothing would make me happ@@ ier than a lifetime of days like this .
I want a big family . A really big family .
With everything that &apos;s going on now ..
So@@ unds perfect .
Don &apos;t know the last thing about art .
I want to mar@@ ry you .
Are you hon@@ est@@ ly willing to give that up ?

I know what you &apos;re doing !
When you went to war ...

Z@@ oul &apos;re real
And in that moment
It was really nice of you to bring that photo .
Well , you take it easy .
It was really good to see you .

E@@ mm@@ et , you had a vision .
training themselves to clear their minds enough ..
that there is nothing in it to clear away in the first place .
I could ?
But I can &apos;t do any of the stuff .
All you have to do is to believe .
you will see everything
I think
Any of you f@@ ell@@ as seen this guy ?
Dra@@ w a cow@@ boy hat on him .
A won@@ dro@@ us land
and , um ...
Ye@@ ah , that too .
Any@@ way , you guys got@@ ta check out these new sub@@ woo@@ fers I installed .
Can you turn that down a little bit ?
Friends , welcome to Cloud Cu@@ ck@@ o@@ ol@@ and . Now .
Ok@@ ay .
I have no idea what &apos;s going on , or what this place is at all
Oh , and this is the Pi@@ ece of Resist@@ ance .
Well , u@@ h , I know that I , for one ..
to get into the Oc@@ tan Tower , find the Kra@@ gle ...
And I know it &apos;s going to be really hard , but .
This be impossible .
with this us@@ eless h@@ unk of g@@ arb@@ age ye see before ye .
to that for@@ s@@ aken place ...
what idea have ye that be better ...
of our fallen Master Bli@@ l@@ der brothers
I may not be a Master Buil@@ der .
fighting or leading or coming up with plans .
In fact , I &apos;m not all that smart .
generally un@@ skilled .
sc@@ ared and cow@@ ard@@ ly .
in the world to lead us . &quot;
No , there was about to be a &quot; but . &quot;
I be leaving this lost cause !
A house divided against itself would be better
You bring your space chair right back here !
We can still do this . Right ?
Well , you were right about him being a ding@@ -@@ d@@ ong .
Get him out of here . I don &apos; w@@ anna look at him
Ru@@ h-@@ ro@@ h . It &apos;s the bad guys .
Go ! Run ! Come on , everyone ! Protect The Special .
If any@@ body has black parts , I need them , ok@@ ay ?
And sometimes , very , very dark gray .
H@@ ey , guys , can I help ?
We have got to find that Pi@@ ece .
The Special is no more .
Super@@ man . W@@ onder Woman , I had no idea you &apos;d be here .
Welcome to my Think Tank .
I don &apos;t mean to sp@@ oil the party , but does anyone else notice ...
I mean , it &apos;s not like a big gig@@ an@@ tic ship .
My gos@@ h !
Well , it &apos;s kind of hard not to hear when you &apos;re y@@ elling everything .
This be-@@ dou@@ bled land couch .
Which means we need more ideas like it !
Mar@@ ry a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
No ! It &apos;s follow the instructions .
Gu@@ ys , you &apos;re all so tal@@ ented and imag@@ in@@ ative .
I &apos;m just a construction worker .
I mean , we could build a sky@@ scra@@ per .
Just imagine what could happen if you did that .
Som@@ ebo@@ dy get me some mark@@ ers ..
and some gli@@ tter glu@@ e !
put the Fi@@ ece of Resist@@ ance on the Kra@@ gle ..
If we can just get in , I know where the air duc@@ ts and wir@@ ing are located .
How will we get inside ?
Spac@@ es@@ hip ! H@@ a , ha !
No , they &apos;re exp@@ ecting us to show up ...
One of those sounds a@@ wesome to me
So not the special spac@@ es@@ hip that I &apos;m building for all of you right now ?
O@@ oh , you &apos;re really let@@ ting the oxygen out of my tank here .
We don &apos;t have that part .
What do you think , a spac@@ es@@ hip is just gon@@ na appear out of the blue ?
The same thing !
Captain Sol@@ o , we must go .
The Dro@@ id &apos;s right . Let &apos;s roll .
This might be the right galax@@ y after all
Of course it &apos;s serious .
G@@ ot room for Just one du@@ de ?
If he &apos;s a cool du@@ de like you .
No way .
You really had me there !
Plus , it turns out the ha@@ iry one &apos;s a du@@ de .
We pilot the ship to the service entrance ..
but also kind of cool
I have a dri@@ ve-@@ on .
&apos;m here to see Z@@ our Dut@@ t .
Oh , my gos@@ h !
Step three : We break into Lord Business &apos; office ...
Step four :
We &apos;ll never help .
place the thing on the other thing ..
Who@@ a , Who@@ a , wh@@ oa . H@@ ey , I didn &apos;t draw that . Is that me explo@@ ding ?
When you re@@ un@@ ite the Pi@@ ece with the Kra@@ gle , it might explo@@ de ?
S@@ ure , sure , sure . Let &apos;s go with that .
Who are you two ?
I see you &apos;ve acci@@ dentally wander@@ ed into my Think Tank .
By which I mean all of them ! Sorry !
Thank you , si@@ r .
Did you just call me &quot; old &quot; ?
My sweet E@@ mm@@ et . Come closer .
I know , I &apos;m doing my best
I made it up .
Now you &apos;re talking !
You don &apos;t know me , but I &apos;m on TV , so you can trust me .
But there is a way out of this .
And he was just like all of you .
He was so good at fitting in , no one ever saw him .
because I used to look down on people like that .
with no ideas or vision . &quot;
they actually came closer ...
And now we have to finish what he started
He &apos;s not just a construction worker , D@@ ad . He &apos;s the hero .
He is a ordinary , regular ..
and I need to put him back where he belongs .
H@@ ey , mo@@ m , can we put this stuff somewhere else ?
What is it ?
A few of your dad &apos;s .
Ye@@ ah .
Just a party in a bottle .
It was a very nice car .
The seats fol@@ ded all the way back .
I can &apos;t believe they kept it .
The ans@@ wering machine .
I &apos;m home !
Mann@@ y , what are you doing sitting in front of a pick@@ le ?
Why do you torture him like this ?
Ah ! Sur@@ prise , surprise !
Check it out .
Me@@ et Mor@@ ris@@ sey the rescue dog ,
He kept b@@ iting her daughter .
He called it rab@@ ies , Sha@@ wn .
She set him loose in my office
That dog is eating my foot .
It &apos;s a B@@ and-@@ Aid , but ok@@ ay for now .
What I meant to say was , my name is Sha@@ wn Sp@@ enc@@ er
C@@ ould you f@@ ell@@ as take a little walk with me ?
Las@@ sie , is that what I think it is ?
We do , but let me just say , although the dog
We had hop@@ ed that this visit alone would
I know , and you &apos;re right , um ...
Hello .
Don &apos;t worry , you will too as long as you keep
Is@@ n &apos;t it obvious ? We want love .
And the end of the i@@ vor@@ y trade .
Well , I am a leg@@ it entrepren@@ eur
I see .
I am in a real Dick@@ ens of a st@@ are down
Body was never found until now , I gu@@ ess .
Butter@@ fly &apos;s baby is playing with a sp@@ le@@ en again .

There &apos;s no gh@@ ost . It &apos;s open and shut .
No , G@@ us , this is bad .
J@@ ules is gon@@ na go right back down there
What does that even mean ?
Be careful for spi@@ ders .
Our guy worked from morning till night , right ?
An ice cream bar ?
The ones where they give you a par@@ ka
He could be an E@@ sk@@ im@@ o . What ?
You &apos;re not a public def@@ ender .
I just don &apos;t want you to make a mistake by going to j@@ ail
May ...
We &apos;re the only non-@@ motorcycle in this parking lot
You bet .
The fur is f@@ ake , Sha@@ wn .
Let &apos;s just get the information we need ,
Fair enough . G@@ us , we need to go .
This vo@@ d@@ ka went right through me .
We &apos;ll be back to wear these co@@ ats again ,

Stim@@ p@@ y . Go@@ ing .
I want you out .
Dol@@ ores , great . I can explain .
Oh , we talking , like , you and I ,
What is that ? Why are you doing that ?
Because I just filled it ,
I see what &apos;s going on here .
I don &apos;t know how to change a di@@ aper , ok@@ ay ?
I don &apos;t care what my dad says .
Let &apos;s talk about that . Let &apos;s un@@ pack that .
I.@@ E. might you offer up your te@@ at ?
Now , that would be huge if I wasn &apos;t dre@@ aming .
G@@ us , what is this ? Why are we doing this ?
Get off of me ! Are you sure ?
G@@ us . G@@ us !
So let me get this straight .
No , not the whole time .
And you can &apos;t ti@@ ck@@ le for cra@@ p .
And is that a c@@ act@@ us growing out of your head ?
I got@@ ta wake up . W@@ ake up , G@@ us .
G@@ us , G@@ us , G@@ us !
We &apos;re not sleeping , du@@ de .
I &apos;m pretty sure Wil@@ ker@@ son &apos;s the real deal ,
You suddenly feel like you w@@ anna conf@@ ess something ?
I used to have a major thing for Je@@ wel ,
Som@@ ehow they &apos;re getting them into the patients &apos; me@@ ds .
Car@@ l@@ ton may have seen a z@@ om@@ bie .
Oh , gos@@ h , it &apos;s the ice chips .
Oh , that &apos;s just di@@ abo@@ lical .
That &apos;s how they get you .
I have money . I can pay you guys .
Sh@@ ame . I just ... I went along with it .
And the next thing you know I &apos;m re@@ covering here
And he offers to keep his mouth shut for a price .
There &apos;s one guy standing over there , G@@ us .
I just ate the last one .
I can &apos;t help it , Sha@@ wn . I run island hot .
Woo@@ dy !
What are you two still doing here ?
Dr. Her@@ sch@@ el &apos;s gone ?
You know , not to p@@ ile on the critic@@ is@@ ms , Woo@@ dy ,
G@@ us , I know where the outside man is .
G@@ us , for the last time .
Our highly skilled tracking dog ,
Do you not know the definition of ins@@ an@@ ity ?
So ? Mor@@ ris@@ sey , smell this mu@@ ff .
What &apos;s the bad news ?
It was B@@ ard ! He killed the dragon !
He brought the be@@ ast down !
Thank you , B@@ ard !
Winter is upon us .
To the sick and the hel@@ pl@@ ess .
We must salv@@ age what we can .
Hello !
Here . P@@ ull your weight .
A@@ ye .

Nothing for certain .
You saw something out there .
Bol@@ g , sp@@ a@@ wn of A@@ zog the De@@ fil@@ er .
You may tell my father ..
Leg@@ olas .
I ride North . Will you come with me ?
He must be hun@@ ted down .
Without the Ring of Power ...
Go now
G@@ anda f
Z@@ ou must sum@@ mon our friends , bird and be@@ ast .
It is here in these halls .
We have search@@ ed and search@@ ed .
Thor@@ in , we all would see the stone returned .
Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here ?
I will not see it taken again .
They have lost everything
Those who have lived through dragon fire ... should re@@ jo@@ ice .
Br@@ ing more stone to the gate !
Here you go .
I do not know how to thank you .
I did not come on your behalf .
There are gem@@ s in the Mountain that I , too , desire .
The White G@@ ems of Las@@ g@@ alen .
Come on .
We are glad to find you alive beyond hope .
Why does the King under the Mountain f@@ ence himself in .
Perhaps it is because I am exp@@ ecting to be rob@@ bed .
but to seek fair settlement .
I am listening .
.. I ask that you honor your ple@@ dge .
So that they might re@@ build their lives .
That armed host will attack this Mountain if we do not come to terms
My people offered you help .
When did Lak@@ e-@@ town come to our aid but for the promise of rich reward ?
A bar@@ gain ?
You &apos;re all .
What are you talking about ?
They are i@@ ke winter th@@ under on a wild wind
Arm@@ ies of Or@@ cs are on the move
Why show his hand now ?
We forced him when the Company of Thor@@ in set out to rec@@ la@@ im their hom@@ eland .
You will for@@ give me if I finish it .
Yes , my lord .
If anything moves on that Mountain ..
The D@@ war@@ ves are out of time .
Do you agree ?
Would you buy it with the blood of D@@ war@@ ves ?
I came .
The Heart of the Mountain .
And worth a king &apos;s ran@@ som .
I took it as my 14th share of the treasure .
You ow@@ e us no loyalty .
know that D@@ war@@ ves can be ob@@ st@@ inate
with the worst man@@ ners
Stand down
He wishes nothing but ill upon my people .
See if he &apos;s still sm@@ ir@@ king then .
Z@@ ou hear that , l@@ ads We &apos;re on !
I &apos;ll get them to safety , si@@ re .
Look after them
Out of my way !
I will not part ..
He could not see beyond his own desire !
A si@@ ck@@ ness which drove your grand@@ father mad
You need@@ n &apos;t worry about that ring . F@@ ell out of my pocket during the battle .
You &apos;re a very fine person , Mr. Bag@@ gins .
But you &apos;re only quite a little fellow ..
And that &apos;s my dining chair .
So , I don &apos;t really have a job title
Don &apos;t forget to take your medicine .
You can make connections here that &apos;ll last forever .
We have a lot of turnover here .
That &apos;s why we have these .
Ok@@ ay , u@@ h ...
disappear .
Con@@ gres@@ sman Mor@@ ley , enough with the taxes .
You don &apos;t see us making you pay ...
through the nose .
Who am I kid@@ ding ? I can &apos;t fall as@@ le@@ ep .
It &apos;s all in your imagination .
An hour ago , I had made the perfect tub !
Su@@ gar ! I love sugar !
You don &apos;t want to go to sleep !
So much has happened since high school .
A sh@@ atter@@ ing depic@@ tion of human suffering .
I just keep remember@@ ing how V@@ la@@ d and I
What time period was all this taking place ?
The way things ended with me and V@@ la@@ d ,
It was the night of the pro@@ m .
Through the m@@ ist , I saw the truck &apos;s head@@ lights .
Oh , y@@ O@@ u &apos;ve got to be kid@@ ding me .
All you have to do is sit there and be quiet .
I &apos;ve lived a long life .
Many friends .
Even took a trip to Washington , D.@@ C. ,
Which is why it was so important that I made it here ton@@ ight .
You are my children !
Not by anything she says , no .
I gu@@ ess they think
Being a mo@@ m is like being a model .
Hi , honey .
Hon@@ ey , I &apos;m so sorry about the way I was ton@@ ight .
I actually got to go back@@ stage and meet N@@ ancy .
Oh , fun .
All she did was talk about herself .
And when the check came , you know what she didn &apos;t do ?
Sorry .
Cla@@ ire , we should be focusing on our feelings .
That was , like , more than 2,000 miles away ?
which then got stuck in Cust@@ oms for , like , a week .
Ye@@ ah . I know . I &apos;m the same way .
Right .
She &apos;s almost a senior . It &apos;s hard to believe .
It fu@@ cking hur@@ ts .
It &apos;s gon@@ na hurt .
No , on why there &apos;s been zero improvement in six months .
well , then maybe you would do better with , u@@ h , someone else .
where now
So I was on break , and I was looking like this .
And I &apos;m like , oh , fu@@ ck , she about to jump !
I started y@@ elling at her .
H-@@ How long before she j@@ ump@@ ed ?
Was it a few minutes before she j@@ ump@@ ed ?
She wasn &apos;t a hundred percent certain .
or when it involved int@@ an@@ gible .
U@@ h , but@@ . but a law@@ suit
N-@@ N@@ ina from group ?
well , I &apos;m certain I can &apos;t give you that information . I &apos;m sorry .
U@@ h-@@ hu@@ h .

Get it . Get it .
I thought we@@ -@@ I thought we didn &apos;t need pres@@ crip@@ tions .
Ok@@ ay , so what do we do ? what do we do ?
Um , that seems really , really tri@@ ck@@ y. what if we get caught ?
will you just get me something other than Mary ?
I think you have bigger problems .

Oh . Nice to meet you .
Silv@@ ana , do you want to go shopping more ,
And whatever you put in that statue that they didn &apos;t find .
Goo@@ d-@@ b@@ ye , Silv@@ ana .
U@@ h , maybe I should .... get the rest of my stuff while I &apos;m here .
You know , you never called my assistant .
Boy , nothing gets past you , hu@@ h ?
No , it &apos;s me .
You &apos;re gon@@ na have to trust me .
It &apos;s not very original .
And your little boy .
She car@@ es about you .
It &apos;s not my fault she gets sen@@ tim@@ ental .
I can &apos;t save you .
I &apos;m not asking you to .

And ? Was he glad to see you ?
Re@@ ally : Another bottle ?

Well , what I think Vincent means is
M@@ ight I ask what the strategy has been
And , of course , I own this house
Maybe 800 , I think , the last time I looked .
Well , over a 5-@@ year period ,
Another benefit is that our investments assist
That &apos;s nice to know , isn &apos;t it ?
A little more wouldn &apos;t go am@@ iss
Well , to limit the administrative costs and your tax liability ,
I &apos;m sure you had something similar with your late husband .
That &apos;s like winning the lot@@ tery .
So , what would you ...
I thought you were in Sp@@ and@@ au .
Well , they let me out early
You should have called
M@@ ind the gap .
The other blo@@ ke was all ,
We committed fraud . Pure and simple
What do you expect me to do ?
I don &apos;t have it .
You speak German ?
I wasn &apos;t really listening .

Would you mind taking him ?
Well , the doctor can bu@@ g@@ ger off .
No , Stephen . I don &apos;t .

Not a whole lot , but they park anywhere they want .
Can we get any closer ?
Ye@@ ah ?
She must know something .
It seems a former employee
Ye@@ ah , but we lost him .
It &apos;s not where he is . It &apos;s what he &apos;s doing .

You wouldn &apos;t w@@ anna do that to me .

Well , I know , but we &apos;re supposed toe spending time together , not going into debt .
What do you mean , &quot; supposed to &quot; ?
Is this something that the doctor made you do ?

Well , we &apos;ve done enough damage for one day .
I want a corn dog first .

You saw E.@@ T. , Av@@ atar , Jur@@ assic World .

No , I was just thinking about Jur@@ assic World .
Oh , we have to use the stairs .
All right , now I &apos;m starting to sense a little tension .
Penn@@ y and I are thro@@ wing this second wedding for your benefit .
Of course . I &apos;m sorry .

Your &quot; check engine &quot; light is on .
So , u@@ h , you must be devast@@ ated about your divor@@ ce .
But I am a bit dist@@ res@@ sed to be in a vehicle
Well , initially I felt something ak@@ in to g@@ rief
Th@@ ank@@ fully , my shock was somewhat mi@@ tig@@ ated by the fact
Oh , that &apos;s nothing .
Y@@ ik@@ es .
That &apos;s exactly what I say during orgas@@ ms : &quot; Y@@ ik@@ es . &quot;
Then why are you telling me ?

Soon to be the husband .
Did he happen to mention a singing wind@@ mill ?
He said it so@@ unded like a cho@@ ir of angels .
He said that it was in a place where he made his biggest score .
And then he laugh@@ ed .
H@@ ang on .
My brother , he needs my help .
I must do this alone .
I will not let go of you until you say I can help you .
Yes .
That means he likes you .
Now , normally , we would require two forms of identification , ma@@ dam ,

What are you doing ?
Get that don@@ key out of here !
Get out of my bank , you be@@ ast !

Ok@@ ay . You know what ? You w@@ anna see Greg@@ g ?
How about if instead of eating this sand@@ wich ,
But what if I told you something about dad and Jane
How do I know your information is even worth
Oh . It would be wrong to teach you that this kind of black@@ mail works .
When dad told Jane he had to work this weekend ,

Well@@ es H@@ ey .
I heard that you flan@@ ked out of fresh@@ man year .
He got thrown out of Princ@@ eton for passing bed checks .
Because of his father he &apos;s got like the all-@@ time golden par@@ ach@@ ute .

It &apos;s a director . He did &quot; Winter Mem@@ ories , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ on@@ light . &quot;
You should go and watch them shoot . You could be in it .
With that c@@ igar@@ ette holder you could be the perfect milk to@@ ast ner@@ d .
I wouldn &apos;t trust my girl with a big time Hollywood director .
You didn &apos;t ask me what I am doing . What are you doing ?
We have pa@@ w at the boarding of Gren@@ ada .
What ? Why not ?
It &apos;s an un@@ belie@@ vable opportunity .
Thank you . Ne@@ ver@@ mind .

Please , no boo@@ ze . What ?
You just wat@@ ched 2 hours of an exist@@ ential ste@@ aming sh@@ it p@@ ile
Rol@@ lie , come on , back . Don &apos;t drink .
It &apos;s a bar and the piano for ton@@ ight .
I thought the film was full of wonderful things .
Because hearing that from me won &apos;t mean anything .
Especially a pretty one , maybe ... You may ...
Ye@@ ah . Come on .
No , she &apos;s not g@@ ay , she &apos;s charming and beautiful .
Go@@ d@@ dam@@ n weekend in the city together , and suddenly she &apos;s ...
She &apos;s ambitious , you should find that admir@@ able .
Instead , you know . Lost the whole , go@@ d@@ dam@@ n , weekend .
I don &apos;t really know why ? I &apos;m having a hard time relaxing , Ch@@ an .
Instead I &apos;m out here in a ...
Don &apos;t tell me , tell her . Tell her to get her priorities straight .
Ok@@ ay , look she &apos;s , apparently , onto a very big story .
Fine , then get over it .
Un@@ less you are wor@@ ried som@@ ebo@@ dy &apos;s h@@ itting on her .
Is she inter@@ viewing attractive men ?
Some might say they are interesting .
Do you think I have to be more demanding , I would .
Su@@ its , Yes , a director and a screen@@ writer .

Oh , Christ , al@@ right .
What do you think I should say ?
Without so@@ unding pos@@ ses@@ sive .

You must really love her . I do , she &apos;s a breath of fresh air .
She &apos;s sexy and somehow at the same she &apos;s wit@@ ty .
I don &apos;t know how to break this to you .
Was that your boy@@ friend ?
What &apos;s G@@ ats@@ by do ?
Which he refers to as &quot; For@@ ced law on University . &quot;
I think that in his wil@@ dest dreams he &apos;d like to be Sky Master@@ son .
I think it has to do with the fact that he and his mo@@ m never really hit it off .
He is really smart .
He doesn &apos;t have to study for a test and then he just aces it .
To tell you the truth .
I &apos;m going to get out of here too .
Why , because I have a little bit of time to kill .
Look at the We@@ e@@ Ge@@ e exhibit .

The beach is so pretty in the rain too .
I know ! I know ! Under the clock .
The Del@@ ac@@ orte clock , where all the animals go around in Central Park .
My M@@ om and I used to watch old movies together all the time .
In my version he &apos;s waiting , the music plays .
Or she &apos;s waiting and he cho@@ oses the other woman .
That sounds pretty good to me , even if it is commercial .
It &apos;s four minutes to six .
You &apos;re at your Del@@ ac@@ orte clock in Central Park .
Der@@ mat@@ ologist .
Would you give me a break , In my version , everything &apos;s fine .
It &apos;s lovely . No@@ body needs a bi@@ op@@ sy .

By she@@ er chance .

S@@ ure , go ahead . Ash@@ lei@@ gh , please .

And then it started to rain .
Her hair got wet , her clothes started to cling to her body .
Now that I think of it , Ch@@ an .
You are just realis@@ ing this now ?
You didn &apos;t think I was cute or attractive , anything ?
You mean I had no physical de@@ form@@ ities .
You know what , Ch@@ an , I wasn &apos;t really paying attention ,
I &apos;m sure Ash@@ lei@@ gh is a beauty queen type .
4@@ H , right ?
In@@ k it in . Let &apos;s get out of here .
How can you say that when you &apos;re in the papers every week
Not now guys , not now .

Would you like to sit down , No , no , no .
Would you like to have dinner with me ?
I have no plans , but to get an early b@@ ite and then .
Party , Dinner ?
No , we just broke up .
While you think about it , ok@@ ay ?

Back to the problem at hand , getting Phi@@ l to fu@@ ck me .

So maybe you should spend a little less time
If you were the resident assi@@ sting me ,
But I &apos;m not gon@@ na let you get ru@@ sty .

Well , then , you &apos;d better make up for it in a minute .
I &apos;m gon@@ na fu@@ cking see it

You sound like a mouse being e@@ aten by a pos@@ sum .

We had to get out of that conversation .
No . You can &apos;t waste tape , F@@ ay ,
You know I paid for that with my own money .
Tell them , &quot; It &apos;s broken . We &apos;ll have to res@@ che@@ dule . &quot;

Ye@@ ah , Just for a sec for the game . They were getting off the bus .
Oh , no . Re@@ ally ?
They got a b@@ unch of Indian boys on their team too ,
Prob@@ ably means they &apos;re
When they put on their jer@@ se@@ ys , they looked like grow@@ n-@@ ups .
H@@ ey , were the lights fli@@ ck@@ ering in here at all ?
Oh , just &apos; cause they were fli@@ ck@@ ering over at the school .
Last time , when I was still teaching ,
Oh , the line to San Mi@@ ri@@ al has got a permanent signal ,
Number , please ?
Are you listening to the radio right now ?
Can you turn your radio on and tell me
Like ...
They came through on top of each other .
All right .
Ye@@ ah , me neither . And then this lady called .
Then I called Eth@@ el
But you trust your su@@ peri@@ ors and you follow orders .
And why is that ?
So what happened next ?
And then when they were done with us ,
What sound ?
You sure it was the same ?
And when we finally took off and I looked out the window ,
And when I got back , then I started getting really sick .
So now I didn &apos;t brea@@ the so good .
Maybe radiation .
The power cut off at the radio ...
I do Highway Hits .
He did the old stuff .
No , we don &apos;t listen to ...
Number please .
Ok@@ ay , I &apos;ll connect you .
There &apos;s a lady calling in for the station !

The best thing you can do for yourselves and for your services ..
I believe the Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or will agree to a full dism@@ iss@@ al .
Want to come play with us until your deal comes through ?
The money &apos;s dec@@ ent .
I am three steps from being a milli@@ on@@ aire .
Maybe .
My pil@@ ots only hit the target 30 % of the time .
We &apos;ve wa@@ ited centuries for Our hom@@ eland
We &apos;re doing this for our freedom .
You &apos;re in this for the money .
So let &apos;s put something else on the table .
Keep doing what you &apos;ve been doing
And no freedom .
Do you know the best place to see the air show ?
The planes ? Air show ?
That was my fault .
But I think we should be ok@@ ay .
This is me , this is my friend . Is that ok@@ ay ?
And the next time you have a plan , it had better work .
How long is that flight ?
Good to have you back , man .
Flight ad@@ versary , baby .
No , man .
The jet lag &apos;s going on .
M@@ om says we have gu@@ ardian angel
He must be a very bra@@ ve man .
Charlie ?
No , thanks . Got@@ ta run .
That &apos;s how it &apos;s put .
All I can say is
Will be fully brief@@ ed tomorrow .
If it means to clear our name
Some of us have history with this thing here , so .
And let &apos;s be honest , the money is bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it .

I got ker@@ os@@ ene in my blood .
Al@@ right .
Look man .

I &apos;ll leave the shooting up to you and the rest of the cow@@ boys , this isn &apos;t for me .
Well , directors don &apos;t like re@@ writes , you know ?
It gets really mess@@ y .
You know what makes them ti@@ ck and it &apos;s new again .
And dangerous .
I live in a plane .
It &apos;s a High Al@@ titude High Opening drop .
Across the Z@@ ange@@ zur Mountains to Azer@@ ba@@ i@@ jan .
I don &apos;t jump out of planes , I fly them .
Yes , si@@ r , but I was not very good at it .
Techn@@ ically , you &apos;re not even in the country .
So I get this call .
I was wor@@ ried about you .
Every@@ body &apos;s wor@@ ried about poor old Tom ?
Go to hell ! That &apos;s my girl
It &apos;s that n@@ os@@ y thing that always got us in trouble , remember ?
Welcome . S@@ it down , my friend sit down .
Enjoy it .
We really have to get back to work , so .
I &apos;m afraid there &apos;s been a change of plan .
J don &apos;t know
You can &apos;t remember your great@@ -@@ grand@@ father &apos;s name
And if they were , all they &apos;d remember ..
Tom .
Or a poor man ?
But in a year when that oil re@@ constitute in its pure form .
Roger that .
Why wake a sleeping bear ?
They &apos;d never had the chance .
Int@@ els said the Russi@@ ans are gon@@ na help the Americans .
What if he gets his loyalty confused ? You want to take that chance ?
This is the moment we were talking about .
Your son is gon@@ na be here safe with me .
What other k@@ id would get such a chance ?
The biggest difference is that you can not hide from her ,
I can see him .
Take him down now
You take the one on the ground .
12 : 00 clock , coming right at us . Two of them .
Let &apos;s b@@ low them out of the sky .
See that right there ? That &apos;s him .
You got@@ ta get us out of here , Cob@@ ra !
Vi@@ per , where the hell are you , man ?
Anna , is Gra@@ cho@@ v with you ?
We can &apos;t do that man .
H@@ old on , Ca@@ j@@ un .
Nice move , Cob@@ ra . Some@@ thing I didn &apos;t teach you .
We got two mis@@ si@@ les remaining
It &apos;s a tra@@ p . P@@ ull up !
You did a good job .
Good listen .
We &apos;re strug@@ gling here .
Som@@ ehow it just doesn &apos;t seem like the right thing to do .
It &apos;s taking us exactly where we want to go .
Now , put your foot down and drive a little faster .
All we have to do is get over two 20-@@ foot walls
After you .
And now you have miss t@@ eller .
We already knew all that .
You told me this was gon@@ na be a simple extrac@@ tion .
I didn &apos;t ask you to light up half of east Berlin .
Don &apos;t fl@@ atter yourself . They follow everybody .
I tell myself , solo ,
You &apos;d be , too , if you &apos;d been up all night
Or are you just looking ?
Nevertheless , you &apos;re gon@@ na have to swal@@ low it .
It is now run by his son , Alexander ,
But she .
All our inform@@ ac@@ ion indicates a le@@ th@@ al combin@@ a tion
We believe they &apos;re responsible for Dr. t@@ eller &apos;s dis@@ appearance .
Imag@@ ine the consequences
Your mission is to in@@ filtr@@ ate this organization
And wh@@ o@@ ever has that disk will simply be
We &apos;ll leave you two to get acquain@@ ted .
Ob@@ viously , i was brief@@ ed about you .
Until you were caught
I concluded it must be to counter@@ act
My woman would never wear anything like that .
I told you . We &apos;re te@@ aming up with the Russi@@ ans .
And why did he call me his woman ?
Give me a minute to explain .
He &apos;s an architect design@@ ing a new resort
He &apos;s also managed to secure a visa for his fi@@ ance .
And what about you ? What &apos;s your cover ?
Perhaps you give them to me .
Then g@@ im@@ me some money for coffee .
Give the gentlemen something for coffee .
Good morning .
Is better for the mission
It means i like my woman strong
Maybe I get you present .
We might be engaged , but I &apos;m my own woman .
I wanted to make sure it was serious .
Why would she be ash@@ amed ?
But a good German girl knows never to mix
Nice to see you .
Exc@@ use me , i said I need to use the sink .
I st@@ up@@ idly seem to have lost my invitation .
Yes . Yes , I think we b@@ ump@@ ed into each other outside .
I do ap@@ ologi@@ ze .
I noticed you &apos;re very good with your hands .
He said , &quot; use the ladies &apos; &quot;
Have the j@@ ets been clean@@ sed
I &apos;d be delighted .
Why don &apos;t you pop into the office tomorrow morning
You see , each one of us has a dest@@ iny .
You can see the future ?
Al@@ one
He had soft bones . And don &apos;t question my methods .
Super agent here decided to have some fun
Your new boy@@ friend is a Nazi .
Me@@ et me on the gan@@ try in five minutes .
I didn &apos;t find anything
I thought that was my father &apos;s watch .
And what exactly did you do to him ?
It takes years to master .
He &apos; be like this for 20 minutes .
Generator &apos;s back on .
Next to hidden button .
Want to have a go ?
I thought I was doing so well .
You were doing fantas@@ tically well .
However , you couldn &apos;t control the loyalty of young Gab@@ y .
I know my father is here and that he works for you .
And the American your wife has been enter@@ taining
Re@@ ally ?
You &apos;re not the first man to have fallen
He &apos;s probably out there in the woods
If you can catch him .
what are you doing ?
And last time , I fell rather b@@ adly and hurt my head .
Sle@@ ep well , Napoleon .
Mum@@ my says h@@ ello .
And my personal favorite :

My ap@@ ologies .

Once upon a time , there was a little boy .
He was neither tall nor hand@@ some ,
Year merged with mis@@ erable year
Re@@ ady ?
One is for the extrac@@ tion of information .
I must admit , this does get fru@@ str@@ ating
With the p@@ liers .
I &apos;m actually quite pleased to see you .
I thought I found all your tra@@ ckers .
Do you mind ?
I &apos;ll tell you everything I know .
What about Gab@@ y ?
Don &apos;t k@@ ick yourself . She fo@@ ol@@ ed me , too .
I &apos;m yours to command .
Don &apos;t go anywhere .
what do you think we should do ?
What should we do wich him
On the one hand , we need him ,
He &apos;ll strike a deal and struggle out of it .
He &apos;ll be out within months
So , what do you think we should do ?
He fixed the gli@@ t@@ ch .
I left my jacket in there .
I believe your instructions are to follow me , so , u@@ h ...
Very well done , my dar@@ ling .
Then we must give them an appropriate welcome .
They are the key
Gent@@ lemen , can you hear me ?
A luxurious 14 hours in which to sei@@ ze the island ,
You have British agent in this ?
I &apos;m starting to smell the ir@@ ony .
Oh , well done , solo , y@@ ep , y@@ ep .
My father has been un@@ well .
He &apos;s ready now to res@@ ume his work .
Gab@@ y has agreed to assist me to assure I finish in time .
You &apos;re wrong .
It was the only way she could stay in the game .
That would give even the average Russian agent
Let me translate this into English .
But now you &apos;ve lost her ,
Well , in a n@@ ut@@ shell , yes , please .
So , what does that do ?
It sends a signal which enables another mis@@ si@@ le
Now that we are converting it to nuclear , it &apos;s red@@ und@@ ant .
We &apos;re nearly done , Victoria .
What are you doing ?
Put her in a cell .
That &apos;s how long you have to finish this .
Please .
You want to go , you got@@ ta go through me .
Is there a point to this or ...
I think you love Crist@@ ina
Her or me ?
No one . I &apos;m choosing no one .
oh , my god .
We can &apos;t go to the I.@@ C.@@ U .
I &apos;m taking this patient out of here .
It &apos;s half inst@@ inc@@ t and half impro@@ v ,
You can &apos;t be in there .
We &apos;re ready for you .
Mer@@ edi@@ th is gon@@ na sit here on the floor .
Come back now !
Look , it took me a long time to find him ,
And now that I realize that ...
You don &apos;t get to cry about that .
She died today .
We need to get to the O.@@ R. !
Turn the elev@@ ators back on ! Turn them back on !
Oh , my god ! Turn the elev@@ ators back on !
That man is still here somewhere .
And he &apos;ll hear us . Please . Sh@@ h .
Ok@@ ay , ok@@ ay ...
You step back .
O@@ wen , I can &apos;t stop . I have to keep going .
You stop or I will shoot you in the head .
You shoot her , you touch her , and I will kill you !
Maybe I shoot you first .
I didn &apos;t come here for this . My wife is dead .
M@@ mm@@ -@@ h@@ mm .
Did a young man named Bob@@ by De@@ Angel@@ o stop by ?
His parents are friends of ours .
Ye@@ ah . Um , this other boy , Chris .
Was it this young man ?
I think P@@ am fixed him a plate . There was so much food .
He , u@@ h ..
And then he asked me for a picture of St@@ ev@@ ie .
Ok@@ ay . Ok@@ ay .
Also , we &apos;re , u@@ h , gon@@ na need to go ahead and get
It &apos;s ok@@ ay .
Last time I seen St@@ ev@@ ie was about a year and a half ago .
I &apos;m sure I sold ice cream to all three of those boys .
I used to be involved in the W@@ ic@@ can religion . White wit@@ ch@@ craft .
With Chris and Michael .
We saw , u@@ h , men .
Um , he tied me up .
I k@@ ick@@ ed him .
This is Det@@ ective Br@@ yn Rid@@ ge of the West Mem@@ ph@@ is Police Department ,
Ye@@ ah , I did . J@@ ason Bal@@ d@@ win called me
I represent Jes@@ sie Mis@@ sk@@ el@@ ley .
He represents J@@ ason Bal@@ d@@ win .
I understand Tes@@ sie has rec@@ an@@ ted his con@@ fession .
No . I@@ it &apos;s hard to believe anyone
I &apos;ve got a doctor who will testi@@ fy that Jes@@ sie
Do you think he &apos;s guilty ?
So Mr. La@@ x , if they &apos;re most likely guilty ,
And I can &apos;t stand by and watch that happen .
He &apos;s got her l@@ ame car@@ ved on his arm .
Why ?
You &apos;re saying you actually believe that ?
No . I &apos;m working with them .
I &apos;m an investig@@ ator .
No . No , I &apos;m not allowed to do that .
Those c@@ ops are sc@@ ary , ok@@ ay ?
Why would so many people say all these things about you ?
Any time anything wei@@ rd happens around here ,
didn &apos;t attack him . He offered it .
I &apos;ve been cutting myself for a long time .
There &apos;s power in the blood ,
By b@@ iting , cutting
These people think I &apos;m a Sat@@ amic leader . &apos; m not .
And they listen to that music .
You think the way they dress had something to do with the
I got it back yesterday , and I &apos;ve been wearing it on my head , like that .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah . He loved it . He loved it . He did .
Um .. Ye@@ ah , he did .
What the hell are you doing ?
You &apos;re not acting right .
On the TV . Tre@@ ating his scar@@ f like some kind of pro@@ p .
I &apos;m not acting at all , Ter@@ ry . Are you ?
I think maybe you &apos;re glad St@@ ev@@ ie &apos;s gone
Every time I spent time with him ,
What ? You &apos;ll hit me ? Now that he &apos;s gone ,
M@@ omm@@ y ? D@@ ad@@ dy ?
H@@ ey , I tried you at home .
Will you meet me for lunch tomorrow , 1 : 00 at the Ar@@ cade ?
Tell me what happened when you got to Rob@@ in H@@ ood W@@ oods .
Then Michael and Chris j@@ ump@@ ed out of the tree .
Jes@@ sie and Dam@@ ien picked him up
What would you like ?
Thanks for meeting me . I know you &apos;re very busy .
The State Police . They called me .
They knew everything about our divor@@ ce proce@@ eding
I mean , you &apos;re a respected man in this city . You &apos;re not on trial here .
He can send another ome .
These boys that you &apos;re helping
Yes . Yes , I am .
You know , you lose perspective . You get ob@@ s@@ essed .
You don &apos;t have to worry about me anymore .
You know , I just remembered , I have to be in court . Early
And then we followed Det@@ ective Allen into the woods .
This trial &apos;s a waste of time . We all know he &apos;s guilty .
Then maybe these journalist par@@ as@@ ites can go back to wherever they come from .
This ended up being a white shirt
Z es
And nobody knows what happened but me .
Jes@@ sie immediately stated that he wanted to tell us about it .
Now , you got in front of you pictures
But this court will not toler@@ ate any verb@@ al out@@ bur@@ st ,
&quot; We the jury find Jes@@ sie L@@ loyd Mis@@ sk@@ el@@ ley Junior guilty
The sentence . How do you fee about the sentence ?
Life plus 40 ? Well , it &apos;s fine with me .
And the good Lord said Luci@@ fer and a third of the angels
Wild , crazy or@@ gi@@ es , I &apos;ve been told .
It &apos;s a war between Satan , Luci@@ fer and the Lord .
I mean , like something suspicious or strange ?
He gave this as a gift to the documentary crew .
Mr. F@@ og@@ lem@@ an released the records concerning this knife yesterday .
Well , we had to send it to the lab first . DNA testing .
Mrs. Hut@@ ch@@ es@@ on , you &apos;re already involved .
And from what I can tell , you &apos;re the only real link
You got@@ ta ask Don .
Yes .
She brought her k@@ id in the day after those boys went missing
YO@@ U think you might know something to help the police find them boys ?
We ques@@ tioned Aaron .
It made sense to me . I already knew about the Sat@@ anic cul@@ t .
We been exp@@ ecting something like this
Ask@@ ed her if there was anything she knew about an oc@@ cul@@ t Or devil wor@@ ship@@ pers .
But then she said , &quot; How about I go play det@@ ective
You &apos;re a real swe@@ e@@ tie to come over here today and do this in this heat .
Do you know that boy , Dam@@ ien E@@ ch@@ ols ?
About people painted black , ch@@ anting , doing what men and women do .
Or anything that would link these mur@@ ders to Dam@@ ien ?
We got Jes@@ sie &apos;s con@@ fession .
Dam@@ ien gave her nothing
They got their con@@ fession from him instead .
A@@ in &apos;t that what our m@@ amas always war@@ ned us about ?
So the jury &apos;s never gon@@ na hear
Remember G@@ it@@ ch@@ ell &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous manip@@ ulations with the tape rec@@ order ?
The State sent 600 items to the lab and out of all that they got nothing
Remember how G@@ it@@ ch@@ ell told the press
They actually changed our case number to the number of the be@@ ast ?
Our boys were never susp@@ ects in this case . They were targets .
But we don &apos;t have to . We can keep looking
If you don &apos;t help those poor boys , who will ?
Ar@@ ise and be bapti@@ zed .
God will never put more on you than you can bear .
U@@ h , none .
I had to fill out , u@@ h , several series of papers .
&quot; Call toll free for information on how to become a doctor . &quot;
Ye@@ ah , you can send in a request for what you want your degree in .
Ju@@ dge , the witness has a mail order PhD from a non-@@ acc@@ redi@@ ted school
Well , I &apos;m not sure within Ar@@ kan@@ sas you need a degree of any kind
But based on the poly@@ graph results ,
Ok@@ ay , I &apos;m gon@@ na lie . I killed them .
Are you ar@@ rest@@ ing me ?
Chris , what are you doing here ?
Your Hon@@ or , the defense calls Christopher Morgan .
Your Hon@@ or , I think they are going to try to cross-@@ examine him
We want to question Mr. Morgan to suggest
Your Hon@@ or ,
Ju@@ dge Bur@@ nett , don &apos;t you think a con@@ fession suff@@ ices as a ti@@ e-@@ in ?
This is not just any@@ body off the street .
Ladies and gentlemen , I am going to need to conduct a hearing in camera so
What ?
Ba@@ ili@@ ff , will you clear the cour@@ tro@@ om , please ?
And why aren &apos;t we allowed to hear what he says ?
I have a right to hear what he says .
On May 17th , 1993 ,
And in a vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ ed statement ..
So you said it just to get out ?
Now , before you made the statements in question ,
Bur@@ nett wouldn &apos;t let him testi@@ fy .
I know .
Besides , F@@ og@@ lem@@ an says there &apos;s no tape for the part
I saw it . I wat@@ ched the whole thing
You guys even watch the entire six hours of tape ?
A syn@@ op@@ sis ?
R@@ on , we did not have enough time or money .
Now , Dam@@ ien , this book on wit@@ ch@@ craft ,
Dam@@ ien , there &apos;s some pages in there that are under@@ lined in red ,
I think som@@ ebo@@ dy had a report to do &apos; cause all through the book
Dam@@ ien , why do you like to wear black ?
And it he ped me deal with people .
Z@@ ou &apos;ve looked into the Sat@@ anic side of the oc@@ cul@@ t , correct ?
You familiar with Al@@ ei@@ ster Crow@@ ley ?
He also believed he was God , so ..
Cor@@ rec@@ t ?
But Crow@@ ley has no particular significance to you ?
And when you look at all this circum@@ stanti@@ al evidence as a whole ,
It doesn &apos;t matter whether the defense att@@ or@@ neys believe it .
The only thing that matters is what these def@@ endants believe .
It gives people who want to do evil the justi@@ fication for what they do .
You see inside that person . You look inside ,
&quot; We , the jury , find Dam@@ ien E@@ ch@@ ols
The angle of this region is very steep .
We &apos;re gon@@ na be on two-@@ hour comm@@ s windows .
If not , don &apos;t swe@@ at it .
Wa@@ y@@ point two is Miller .
If we &apos;re home by the 15th , me and Morgan
Hello ?

And the second they run down there ,
T@@ ie them up . Let &apos;s get the fu@@ ck out of here .
I thought you were standing by waiting for your fu@@ cking orders ?
What do you think that radio &apos;s for ?
I know what the fu@@ cking radio &apos;s for .
It &apos;s a cell phone to the T@@ ali@@ ban .
That &apos;s a war@@ ri@@ or .
Mik@@ ey , it &apos;s your fu@@ cking call . I ain &apos;t fu@@ cking voting
We &apos;re gon@@ na cut them loose and we &apos;re gon@@ na make this peak .

Now , that &apos;s not exactly asking too much , is it ?
It was a real drag that I was no longer allowed to use my other gur@@ ney .
It h@@ ad-@@ caused a couple of spectacular accidents .
I couldn &apos;t see wher@@ es was going .
Elizabeth , pregnant herself with Saint John
.... that gave Mary the courage she was lacking .

A@@ men .
One who created me in his own image .
I &apos;m Mark O &apos;@@ Bri@@ en . I knew Father Se@@ am@@ us very well .
As are many others . I &apos;ll do my best to fill his shoes .
I told my atten@@ d@@ ant to come back in half an hour . Is that ok@@ ay ?
That &apos;s good enough for me .
Do you have any experience ?
That sounds perfect .
Three or four hours . Ye@@ ah ?
She took me on a pic@@ nic once With her boy@@ friend and another couple .
And what did the boy@@ friend think ?
I &apos;m always in som@@ ebo@@ dy &apos;s way , I thought

He &apos;s an as@@ sh@@ ole . Do@@ esn &apos;t matter what he thinks of you .
First session .

He y@@ elled a lot when I took off his shirt , but I think more out of fear than pain .
He &apos;s capable of achieving an er@@ ection easily ,
Som@@ ehow you don &apos;t feel like you &apos;ve done it until you &apos;ve gone all the way in .
Come on , give it a try . Open your eyes ,

She was very ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic .
Of course I can picture him . From the outside .
As you are now .
.. crew cut and his little face .
The fact that I &apos;m already happy does not seem to be relevant .
He &apos;s a philosop@@ her .
No . In his own mind .
He thinks a lot .
H@@ ey , we did great today . You were fantastic .
which now has a proven track record .
Was I really inside you ?
For how long ? At least five or six seconds .
That &apos;s a long time for some people .
It was ... It was all a j@@ um@@ ble of sens@@ ations .
It was pen@@ is-@@ vag@@ ina all the way ... and you definitely get an &quot; A &quot; for orgasm .
Did you come ?
Can we try for that next time ?
Oh , si@@ r , I &apos;d wait a couple minutes . That coffee &apos;s kind of hot .
So , what should we talk about ?

We &apos;@@ ne pre@@ ten@@ ding , right ?
Let me what ?
That &apos;s a whole other thing . What are you doing opening my mail ?
Even less reason to open it . Where is it ? Give it to me .
This is none of your business . You &apos;re still not getting it .
You didn &apos;t . I fu@@ cking did !
Would you ask your mother ... to pass the salt , please ?
Run@@ ner on first with one out ...
And he struck him out ! I don &apos;t think he was exp@@ ecting that .
The person you are calling is not in . Please leave a message .

Well , we &apos;re spent fort@@ y-@@ d@@ oll@@ ar@@ s-@@ ally .
Carol@@ ine has a rough story .
I &apos;m sorry , but did all that really happen to you ?
Five years ago today , in fact .
Well , have you ever considered
You &apos;re still here ?
Or a person who would come here twice .
All right . Well , think about it .
You work at Avis ?
And remember , you have a story to tell .
I think you should totally do this .

Will any of them wait tables ?

Be ready to cut . Roger that .

The largest ever recorded here in North America :
The energy release was the equivalent of 10 million at@@ om bom@@ bs
the coast of Val@@ di@@ via in Southern Chile
This qu@@ ake lasted 11 minutes and sp@@ aw@@ ned a ts@@ un@@ ami 82 feet high ..

Pla@@ yed a little tu@@ g of war with a car .

35 miles sou@@ theast of Vegas , maybe 5 miles from the Hoo@@ ver D@@ am .
There aren &apos;t any faul@@ ts out there .
And if the magnetic pul@@ se rate goes up before the qu@@ akes .
All right .
Hi , D@@ ad . H@@ ey , swe@@ e@@ tie .
Th@@ ought that I could ride it to class , then I wouldn &apos;t have to buy a parking pass .
All right , great . I can &apos;t find the key to the lock at M@@ om &apos;s ..

You know , you &apos;re quite beautiful .
We &apos;re gon@@ na head straight over . Excellent .
Where you from ? England .

Would you like to hear our itiner@@ ary ?
Am I interrup@@ ting anything ?
Look , I just wanted to tell you I was sorry for how I acted yesterday .
No , Emma .
I should &apos;ve told you before .
She &apos;d like us to be a family again .
Emma .
Oh , Jesus , Ray . I got@@ ta get ou@@ tt@@ a here .
Dro@@ p , cover and hold on !
What does that mean ?
So it &apos;s a hundred times stronger now !
Professor ! It looks like the whole San Andreas fault line is being activated .
All right . All done .
Well , it was really nice to meet you , Ol@@ lie . I hope you have fun while you &apos;re here .
Good b@@ ye .
I almost forgot . Do you mind if I bor@@ row your book for a second ?

Stay strong , honey .
Wa@@ it , M@@ om . How are you and D@@ ad together ?
I love you guys .
Hello , Chris .
He and his research partner , Dr. Kim Park
But nobody listen@@ ed to them .
Go ahead , doctor . Ok@@ ay .
Basi@@ cally , California &apos;s entire t@@ ec@@ ton@@ ic plate has shi@@ fted .
from movement along the fault line .
Their end of the fault line has not moved yet .
And it &apos;s not after@@ sho@@ cks I &apos;m talking about .
And it &apos;s going to be a bigger monster this time .
It will be so big that , even though it &apos;s happening here in California .
Now , I cannot empha@@ size this enough to the people of San Francisco :
I never bl@@ amed you . I don &apos;t w@@ anna talk about it .
She &apos;s gone . Now you &apos;re gone ..
I gu@@ ess the point is .
The moment she realized
Because nothing was the way it used to be . And the way it used to be was .
I should &apos;ve let you in .
I &apos;m so sorry for how things ended with us , E@@ m .
If you couldn &apos;t save our daughter ...
Let &apos;s go get our daughter .
which leads to Co@@ it Tower .
One of them used to be my sister &apos;s .
We had given them to each other for Christmas the year before .
H@@ ey . Check it out .
They should have a supply box . It &apos;ll have stuff that we can use .
Oh , ok@@ ay .
Every city has a tac@@ tical channel
Ok@@ ay .
San Francisco has begun ev@@ acu@@ ation .
.. the fault line in the Central Valley .
San Francisco is going to get hit again , and this will be a much bigger monster .
This is it , isn &apos;t it ?
This will be over soon here .
Did you know &quot; No@@ b &quot; is a s@@ lang term ..
Lar@@ gest qu@@ ake in recorded history .
Co@@ it &apos;s been burning a while . She &apos;s gone some@@ place else .
What &apos;s your Plan B ?
What &apos;s happening ?
We got@@ ta get ou@@ tt@@ a the bay , now .
Ye@@ ah . There &apos;s too much ble@@ eding .
Let &apos;s pack him and get him up to I.@@ C.@@ U .
I am not bab@@ ys@@ itting .
I need to check for a sep@@ tal hem@@ at@@ oma .
All right , fine .
Why are you still here ? You can go .
But N@@ ico won &apos;t leave until he knows C@@ lem &apos;s gon@@ na be ok@@ ay .
You let that k@@ id run wild .
Well , maybe I need to ho@@ ver
He wasn &apos;t gon@@ na stay .
Well , stop giving us things .
You have no way of knowing who gave who the head li@@ ce .
They &apos;re 10 . They &apos;re in love . They &apos;re cute .
Exc@@ use me , doctor , something &apos;s wrong with C@@ lem .
E@@ ver thought you &apos;d be wish@@ ing so hard
Hon@@ ey , we &apos;re leaving now .
N@@ ico , don &apos;t make me pick you up .
This is embar@@ rass@@ ing , you know ?
I don &apos;t care .
She &apos;ll think that I don &apos;t love her .
What if I &apos;m there when she w@@ akes up ?
It &apos;s like the next best thing to being there .
Ye@@ ah .
Oh , good . U@@ h , all right . Here we go .
The ov@@ ary spec@@ im@@ en you sent is normal .
Dam@@ n . We picked the wrong ov@@ ary .
You don &apos;t have a very good personality , you know that ?
c@@ d@@ l@@ ple@@ dge myself to thee forever .
Love me tender
I &apos;ve never really felt like I was part of a family before .
D@@ ad had the first camera .
I wanted you to know that I think you are a wonderful brother .
and I &apos;m really grateful that you invited me .
And we were more than friends . Family
Oh , gos@@ h .
Are you ok@@ ay ?
my beautiful wife .
Oh , sh@@ it . I &apos;m stuck .
I don &apos;t know . The guy in the c@@ ab ?
See you later , Santo I@@ Dom@@ ingo .
T@@ ilt your head back .
I got beat up here a couple times , but that &apos;s not gon@@ na happen to you .
Ah , this is where me and your mo@@ m got married .
This is where we walk the dog .
Sh@@ it , fu@@ ck . Ma@@ ver@@ ick !
H@@ ey , h@@ ey . Ma@@ ver@@ ick !
No , no , we don &apos;t live here . Come on .
U@@ gh . It was fine . I just had to leave because I &apos;m star@@ ving
Ok@@ ay .
How are you feeling ?
All right . Who@@ o ! Get ready .
No , seriously , Sam . Please , just wait there .
Oh , sh@@ it ! Sam !
What are you doing ? Are you fu@@ cking crazy ?
Stop , stop !
We &apos;re gon@@ na get some help . We &apos;re gon@@ na get some help .
You know , we talked about the summer courses .
and then go back to the full load in the fall .
No , I don &apos;t want to just wait until the fall .
I know , it &apos;s just that this has come up and I ...
I know it &apos;s not gon@@ na be easy . But I don &apos;t want to put everything on hold just to ..
I got@@ ta keep working .
then I feel like I &apos;m not gon@@ na be able to start back up again .
Then I &apos;m gon@@ na turn into your sister .
Sam , you &apos;re not gon@@ na be N@@ atal@@ ie . It &apos;s you and me .
but this isn &apos;t what I wanted to begin with , ok@@ ay ?
I don &apos;t want to bo@@ ther Sam .
How did we get home last night ?
What the fu@@ ck ?
So I came home , looked at all the tap@@ es , and there &apos;s all this mystery fu@@ cking ...
ou sure , man ? Maybe it &apos;s some wei@@ rd sh@@ it they do down there to sc@@ are tourists .
What the fu@@ ck ?
What are you talking about ?
It &apos;s empty . It &apos;s gone . The fu@@ cking tape is gone now .
e everything I &apos;ve seen says they &apos;re , u@@ h , religious symbols .
So , u@@ h , there &apos;s these ones ..
There &apos;s a b@@ unch more .
What ?
&quot; And children , this is the last hour . &quot;
They tried to bring the church down in its early days .
We &apos;ve caused the displac@@ ement of thousands of families into refugee camps .
The question we &apos;ve got to ask ourselves is ...
I wasn &apos;t exp@@ ecting you to come all the way out here .
Are you still ch@@ asing space rocks ?
The data is unden@@ i@@ able .
I Can &apos;t .. not yet . We &apos;re too close .
Is that you don &apos;t have to wait to the commercial to p@@ iss .
See pain , I can deal with that .
World &apos;s going to hell anyway . We &apos;re just re@@ ap@@ ing what we &apos;ve s@@ own .
$ 40 . That all ?
One minute it &apos;s a job , next he &apos;s got his cock in your mouth .
They think you &apos;ll charge half the price for just one kne@@ e pad ?
What &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
For all the good it &apos;s gon@@ na do .
We don &apos;t we want your fasc@@ ist war !
All right , all right , come on , people . Let &apos;s wra@@ p this up .
We don &apos;t we need .. what the ...
H@@ ey , si@@ r ? H@@ ey , you look like a smart guy .
Then go back to killing children again .
Ex@@ plain why some as@@ sh@@ ol@@ es are moving my scra@@ p .
This some kind of inside job ?
No ? It sure looks like your boy Cham@@ ber@@ la@@ in to me .
Ron@@ an ,
Neb@@ ula , go to X@@ and@@ ar and get me the Or@@ b .
It will be your d@@ oom .
I &apos;m a daughter of Th@@ an@@ os .
What a b@@ unch Of los@@ ers .
Look at this guy !
What is this thing ? Look how it thinks it &apos;s so cool
W@@ an@@ ted to be here . S@@ ends his love .
What is it ?
Ye@@ ah , well , I almost died getting it for you .
Some mach@@ ine-@@ headed fre@@ ak , working for a du@@ de named Ron@@ an .
I truly am .
Who &apos;s Ron@@ an ?
What ? What about my bad side ?
H@@ ey , we had a deal , Br@@ o !
This guy just back@@ ed out of a deal on me .
Peter Qu@@ ill . People call me Star@@ -@@ Lord .
Well , you know , I wouldn &apos;t say that .
Qu@@ it sm@@ iling , you idi@@ ot . You &apos;re supposed to be a professional .
H@@ ey !
Like how much this is gon@@ na hurt .
Ra@@ ised from youth by a band of mer@@ cen@@ aries called the Rav@@ agers ,
I didn &apos;t know how this machine worked .
Transport all four to the K@@ y n .
I ain &apos;t gon@@ na be here long
I ain &apos;t about to be brought down by a tree and a talking rac@@ co@@ on .
It &apos;s what you are , st@@ up@@ id .
So , this Or@@ b has a real sh@@ iny blue su@@ it@@ case ,
Z@@ oul &apos;re sc@@ um ! You &apos;re sc@@ um !
A lot of prisoners here have lost their families
Mur@@ derer !
They &apos;re here to stop u@@ S from getting out .
Wh@@ atever night@@ mar@@ es the future holds ,
Her life
I sh@@ a &apos; kill one of his in return .
Qu@@ ill ! What are you doing ?
I &apos;m your only hope at st@@ opping him .
H@@ ey ! H@@ ey , h@@ ey , h@@ ey ! H@@ ey !
You know , if killing Ron@@ an is truly your sole purpose ,
Well , I mean , she &apos;s hardly the first woman to try and do that to me .
No , it &apos;s a symbol .
would not sli@@ ce his thro@@ at .
You &apos;ve heard of this . You &apos;ve seen this , right ?
As@@ le@@ ep for the danger , aw@@ ake for the money ,
We know only that she has been captured .
No ! Our sources within the K@@ yl@@ n say Gam@@ ora has her own plans for the Or@@ b .
Then she was app@@ reh@@ ended by the Nova Corps .
Your sources say that she meant to betra@@ y us the whole time !
I may be your ..
The only matter I do not take seriously , boy ,
And , apparently , you ali@@ en@@ ated my favorite daughter , Gam@@ ora .
But return to me again emp@@ ty-@@ handed ,
This is one fight you won &apos;t win .
If we &apos;re gon@@ na get out of here ,
The guards wear security bands
Man who has ain with an A &apos;@@ ask@@ av@@ ari@@ ian !
We need all available guards in full combat gear ...
Why is this one here ?
I always keep my promises ,
I just need these two things .
No , I thought it &apos;d be funny .
Wa@@ it , what did he look like h@@ opping around ?
How are we going to leave ?
Right ? Or is that another thing you made up ?
Sh@@ ut up .
What is that ?
Or if you w@@ anna b@@ low up mo@@ ons .
You just w@@ anna su@@ ck the joy out of everything .
We &apos;re heading in the right direction . For now .
And how much do you trust me ?
Because I &apos;m gu@@ essing it &apos;s some kind of weapon .
If it &apos;s a weapon , we should use it against Ron@@ an .
I let you live once , pr@@ inc@@ ess !
H@@ ey !
We &apos;re stuck together until we get the money .
Great .
And Qu@@ ill , your ship is fil@@ thy .
If I had a black light ,
If he knew where they were headed ,
Well , then ,
And this place ?
Clean@@ se it !
I like to stick &apos; em all in a row on my control console .
In that case , I can show you .
And then you gon@@ na tell me ,
The high-@@ end community is a .
T@@ igh@@ t-@@ kn@@ it .
Now , who again is this buyer of yours ?
Your people do have el@@ b@@ ows , do they not ?
Then use them .
Do T
Be war@@ y headed in , ro@@ dent .
H@@ und@@ reds of years ago , the Ti@@ van Group sent workers in
All rare resources , highly valu@@ ed in black markets across the galax@@ y .
Well , I come from a planet of out@@ laws .
It sounds like a place , which I would like to visit .
Watch your wall@@ ets .
Get out of here
Get out of here !
What do you expect us to do while we wait ?
My Or@@ lon@@ i has won ,
That &apos;s the first thing you said that wasn &apos;t b@@ at-@@ sh@@ it crazy !
I might actually lose money on this job .
It &apos;s just a negoti@@ ation tac@@ tic . Trust me , this is my speci@@ alty .
He tor@@ tured me
My mother gave it to me .
I happened to have it on me ,
What do you do with it ?
I &apos;m a war@@ ri@@ or and an ass@@ ass@@ in . I do not dance .
On my planet , there &apos;s a legend about people like you .
Fon@@ an , it is done
These po@@ ds aren &apos;t meant to be out here .
A@@ w , dam@@ n it .
What happened ?
I don &apos;t know what came over me .
I found something inside of myself
It &apos;s .. Well , they got the Or@@ b .
Bla@@ sted idi@@ ot . They &apos;re all idi@@ ots !
N@@ one of this ever would have happened if you didn &apos;t try to single-@@ han@@ de@@ dly
was a f@@ ool
Captain , the shot was non-@@ dam@@ aging
It &apos;s a weapon of my own design .
If you don &apos;t hand over our compan@@ ions now ,
No ! Wa@@ it , hold on !
We figured it out ! We &apos;re fine !
You call that &quot; figured it out &quot; ?
You want to talk about sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
We were only gon@@ na b@@ low you up if they didn &apos;t turn you over !
We didn &apos;t have time to work out the min@@ uti@@ ae
Secondly , I don &apos;t even believe you have a plan .
What percentage of a plan do you have ?
I just saved Qu@@ ill .
When did we establish it ?
I wasn &apos;t listening . I was thinking of something else .
What percentage ?
T@@ wel@@ ve percent ?
That is the most real , authentic , h@@ yst@@ er@@ ical lau@@ gh of my entire life
You &apos;re taking their side ?
So what , it &apos;s better than 11
See ? Gro@@ ot &apos;s the only one of you who has a clu@@ e .
Come on .
He expects to hear this big plan of ours .
T look around at us .
Not run away .
But , Qu@@ ill , st@@ opping Ron@@ an ,
Ye@@ ah , I gu@@ ess I am .
I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies .
You are an hon@@ orable man , Qu@@ ill .
And in the end ,
What the hell . I don &apos;t got that long a li@@ fes@@ pan , anyway .
We &apos;re all standing up now .
The Stone re@@ acts to anything organic .
All Ron@@ an &apos;s got to do is touch the Stone to the planet &apos;s surface and z@@ ap .
Everything will die .
Bo@@ ck@@ x@@ et will lead a team to b@@ low a hole
W@@ on &apos;t there be hundreds of Sak@@ a@@ ar@@ an soldiers inside ?
Once they know we &apos;re on board ,
We &apos;ll make it to the flight deck ,
There are too many of them , Roc@@ x@@ et !
Peter Qu@@ ill
They got my &quot; dick &quot; message !
He said &quot; she &apos;s got a gun in my mouth . &quot;
Otherwise , his head whi@@ st@@ les
I don &apos;t negoti@@ ate .
Right this way , guys .
Go@@ d@@ dam@@ n , she &apos;s still here .
You &apos;re going to look just like me .
Now , listen , here &apos;s the plan .
But if you want it , you &apos;re gon@@ na have to come and get it .
You know , face to face ?
Oh , you do continue to del@@ ight and am@@ a@@ ze .
I really can &apos;t imagine why .
If I help you , what &apos;s in it for me ?
You &apos;re right .
En@@ ough .
Back off , both of you .
But you know , about seven years ago ,
And the word on the street was that he
She , for , yes , indeed , it was a woman ,
It &apos;s hero@@ ine and it &apos;s , um , it &apos;s ultimate trage@@ dy , for her bl@@ ast
He , amaz@@ ingly , escap@@ ed with only minor injuries .
You know , what went wrong , do you think ?
Did she feel any re@@ mor@@ se ?
Any@@ way , the long and the short of it
Oh , how the might fall , eh ?
Do you think such a myth@@ ical cre@@ ature could possibly exist ?
Now , I &apos;m going to take a different t@@ act here .
You know , boo@@ m .
I have the feeling that you might bal@@ k at causing yet
Why should I believe you ?
E@@ ver
Mit@@ ch and C@@ am are having a party for val@@ ent@@ ine &apos;s .
L@@ ily , we &apos;re so happy to have you here .
Look ! A bran@@ d-@@ new , sh@@ iny TV remote !
Just keep h@@ itting all those buttons until something good happens .
Where were all these dist@@ rac@@ tions
Can I help you ?
J@@ ay , I &apos;ve been waiting for this appointment for weeks .
The human race has survived for a thousand years
Maybe when kids started flying off cars .
Norm@@ ally I have help , but D@@ ale , u@@ h ...
He &apos;s my sister &apos;s k@@ id
Where do you want it ?
I &apos;m attracted to him because he &apos;s sexy ,
The carrying of the boxes ...
You &apos;ve had my wife &apos;s car four days .
The y@@ elling on the phone ..
And the drilling .
Time to go , Har@@ lan .

We &apos;re not that different .
I was invited to many pas@@ so@@ ver in their home .

Whether we make the switch
You &apos;re the only one who e@@ ats them !
I &apos;m not going ; you can &apos;t make me .

Where &apos;d you get that from ?
U@@ gh . A@@ my , why did you tell him that ?
I don &apos;t always defend Shel@@ don .
What about your wei@@ rd relationship with him ?
I &apos;m like the little girl in Pol@@ ter@@ gei@@ st
Your infections are getting worse .
I didn &apos;t have them before you two idi@@ ots operated .
Again , I am sorry , but your lung cancer
When am I getting ou@@ tt@@ a here ?

There is not much more that we can do
Well , we &apos;ll run some tests ,
Well , it &apos;s at a 0.@@ 8 now , and I &apos;d like it to be above a 2 .
It wasn &apos;t your fault . It was a massive M.@@ I .
Is there a chance they could shut down the trial ?
I want to know why we didn &apos;t see it coming .
Yes , si@@ r , but since she has had no contact with the baby ,
I mean , come on . I &apos;m all for mother / baby bon@@ ding ,

Besides , you &apos;re the one that told me to go .
You know how hard this has been ?
So it doesn &apos;t matter that I &apos;m finally happy
Oh , you better not p@@ out , you better not cry .
You &apos;re a cow@@ ard who &apos;s too afraid to be Santa Cl@@ aus !
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve been trying to tell you !
Wa@@ it , where are you going ?
Do you know what ? If I wasn &apos;t so enligh@@ tened ,
She &apos;s invited me over for Christmas morning .
You &apos;re gon@@ na go , right ?

When are we gon@@ na see No@@ elle and Pol@@ ly again ?
Pol@@ ly ! That ..
But you &apos;re gon@@ na get your wish and spend

What are you doing here ?
Did you fly here all by yourself ?
You &apos;re so bra@@ ve . You must have picked up
Oh . What have you got ? It &apos;s from Mother .
Lau@@ gh .. mostly at you .
So , when Pol@@ ly came to see me
I believe that you believe .
And it turns out there &apos;s nothing there
It &apos;s just a tradition we &apos;ve been
Oh , man !
Ul@@ tim@@ ately , the one thing all Sant@@ as share
What does Christmas mean to you ?
How long have you been out in the field ?
I want to hear what you say .
I didn &apos;t know you smo@@ ked .
Right after I qu@@ it drinking
How do I feel ?
She asked a very good question .
Well , that &apos;s a question that needs to be asked .
We &apos;re vulnerable to qu@@ al@@ ms of conscience like anyone else .
Like everything else ,
I hate that it had to turn out this way .
We have a station for you to look after .
And one of the very few people who can process code at this level .
You keep the station safe , you keep the code safe .
Ok@@ ay .

No , the codes change every shift .
Where are they ?
We &apos;re gon@@ na walk . We &apos;re gon@@ na call for help . Ok@@ ay ?

Jet &apos;s see what &apos;s down there .
He only fired two shots .
Oh , my God !
He knew there was a gun hidden down here .
There it is .
But they &apos;ve already sent the broad@@ casts .
They w@@ anna kill us . Make sure you don &apos;t cancel the broad@@ casts .
Used to what ?
They never seem to stay dead . How &apos;s it going over there ?
I know , but can you open it ?
We don &apos;t .
Can you just talk to me ?
Any@@ thing Just regular stuff . Like what normal people talk about .
How do you know I dropped out of college ?

Now@@ here ! Where am I gon@@ na go ?
And what have you got , hu@@ h ?
How could that possibly matter ?
What have you got ? You &apos;ve got nothing to live for except for this !
You &apos;ve got your protocol . You &apos;ve got your numbers .
And you read them and you take their money .
Do you think you can fu@@ ck around with these people ?
Will I die ?

It &apos;s a lot different than taking a piece of scra@@ p out of your leg
This is gon@@ na take the pain away for a while .

He said to say , &quot; Thanks for all your help . &quot;

Never spent one bloo@@ dy night away from home
Y@@ ep .
Actually ...
I would like your permission
.. I &apos;d like to spend some time with her before I leave .
So why Berlin Sa@@ p &apos; ?
It &apos;s just mud and sl@@ ur@@ ry . Like sin@@ king a mine in a bo@@ g .
This whole area is below sea level .
Was ?
We &apos;re 90 feet down now .
Hill 60 is directly above us .
Beautiful .
Fritz has set up in the swim sand .

No , no , no . No . Fritz has got no idea .
Top level &apos;s mostly sand@@ .@@ C@@ lay starts around 30 feet .

As the mother of five ,
If &apos;s bad enough she st@@ ole your husband ,

So while you &apos;re opening your port@@ foli@@ os
Portra@@ its of children .
Did you look in my portfolio ?
I wanted to steel myself for dis@@ appointment .
Appar@@ ently not .

Just what ? :
I don &apos;t w@@ anna say anything bad .
You don &apos;t need to sit here listening to my ...

You know .
You know it . We know it . Why are we dancing around it ?
See , they used to be like that .
Now because she &apos;s crazy
G@@ ot it ?

Who the hell who does that ?
I &apos;m kin@@ da wondering the same thing .
And there &apos;s your arm .
I bet it &apos;s nice to know what to expect
Se@@ ems like something that ought to come up on a first date .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah . You shoul@@ da brought a b@@ ull w@@ hip .
Then I insert them with the cath@@ eters
To dra@@ in the hearts of their existing cardi@@ ac cells
We are sc@@ rub@@ bing away cells of hearts , Crist@@ ina ,

Any other questions ?

So you were walking .
Well ...
So that was a little aw@@ k@@ ward .
Almost seems like you guys were a thing .
Oh , really ?
C@@ alli@@ e .

She &apos;s alone .
Turn it off . Please .
I see some ble@@ eding .
Oh , no one thinks that .
Na@@ om@@ i does .
She knew I would &apos;ve fre@@ aked out .

Maybe I mis@@ represented myself a little bit .
H@@ ang on . Kir@@ by was going for her
You were the k@@ night on the white horse
I &apos;ll tell you one thing ,
Did you tell her yet ?
I went to look for your wife in the waiting room .
Oh , no .
H@@ ey , don &apos;t do that .
The ice isn &apos;t cra@@ cking .
I mean , can you imagine the law@@ suits
Who@@ ever did this is an artist .
But now the world &apos;s gone soft .
So , we created a sport for people
Our customers are some of the most powerful
More complicated rooms .
More ways to gam@@ ble on life and death .

What are you saying exactly ?
Let &apos;s say we &apos;ll be having to turn
Our money you mean .
Without this , I &apos;ve got nothing .
Just had other priorities .
It &apos;s nothing that you ain &apos;t used to , Jack .
We &apos;ll take it .

Let me shoulder the burden . It would be my pleasure .
You are not my mother .
I wish it were that easy , Z@@ ach@@ ary ,
I haven &apos;t heard back and I was getting a little concerned .
I thought the whole point of having a cell phone
Mike , I need you to call me back . I mean it .
Can you take those off ? There &apos;s no way I &apos;m dres@@ sing him .
Be@@ ating up a second g@@ ay guy looks bad .
So why did you change your mind ?
So if I &apos;m gon@@ na get you out of this m@@ ess , you have to reci@@ proc@@ ate .
Doctor &apos;s appoint@@ ments , you &apos;re driving . I won &apos;t put a car seat in my Mas@@ er@@ ati .
I don &apos;t like the idea of this guy being around Juli@@ e 24@@ 17 .
Mike &apos;s cool , D@@ ad . He car@@ es about us a lot and I like having him around .
He &apos;s still a pl@@ um@@ ber .
You Hon@@ or , this whole m@@ ess is just a result of my lon@@ el@@ iness .
After Carlos was convic@@ ted ...
Oh , no , I &apos;m talking about his other crime .
Go ahead .
He knows how men look at me and ...
I ... fal@@ sely led him to believe I was having an aff@@ air .
I thought that maybe if he believed I was having an aff@@ air ...
I know it sounds st@@ up@@ id . I do . I just ...
My point is that Carlos is an angry , je@@ al@@ ous Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ al .
She was just a sad girl with a lot of problems .
But you tell me what she ever could have done to des@@ erve death
It &apos;s so ... complicated .
You want some car@@ rot , Z@@ ach@@ ary ?
I &apos;d like you to meet Ir@@ ina .

But you &apos;ve only known each other for a few months .
Oh , honey .
Why : The fe@@ ds don &apos;t care about him .
Oh , so that &apos;s why you want to take him away .
If my k@@ id shows up , he &apos;s a direct link to me .
That was 18 years ago .

Yes , P@@ rest@@ on . I know exactly how much it is worth .
So .. Let &apos;s eat .
My mother and father met at a bar .
They had one night together , and then he went away .
He had just met you and said he was in love .
We are atten@@ ding my A@@ unt Flora &apos;s 9@@ 3rd birthday party .
She &apos;ll be dis@@ appointed if we don &apos;t show up .
She won &apos;t be dis@@ appointed for very long .
I made a written record request 72 hours in advance .
I even cont@@ acted the Cent@@ ers For Dis@@ ease Control to find out
A@@ my , the relationship agreement was not designed
I use it to get the right way .
You gave me your word .
Maybe she &apos;ll dig it .
I can never find the til@@ ler .
Ye@@ ah , I always thought if I were ever ens@@ la@@ ved ,
You &apos;re right .
I should be able to figure this out .
Then I thought if I did check with you first ,
You don &apos;t have to check with me .
I gu@@ ess I was hop@@ ing for a different reaction , but ok@@ ay .
I don &apos;t know ,
Ok@@ ay , I &apos;m an actress . Ask me again .
Wh@@ a .. the entire weekend ?
But li ..
I knew what I was getting into .
Oh , my , is it getting hot in here ?
That &apos;s why you &apos;re lucky to have me .
Bern@@ ad@@ ette , remember , your character &apos;s the heal@@ er in our group .
I can &apos;t help it .
Ten thousand .
You know ? Why don &apos;t you take that sh@@ it to the c@@ ops ?
Tw@@ enty-@@ five thousand .
Come on inside and meet the boys .
N@@ one of that sp@@ inner , hydraulic sh@@ it to get you lit up .
We surely don &apos;t mind being your fu@@ cking little mu@@ le , Don Carlos .
We &apos;re the one doing all the risks .
And I need to get that Bra@@ d P@@ itt movie .
R@@ unning low on milk , a few things .
I love the way you put &quot; fu@@ cking &quot; in the middle of a word like that .
You see , guys , I kind of , u@@ h ...
But , you know , we can &apos;t all be Sam Wal@@ ton .
And when my foot soldiers start talking about sh@@ it like cuts
And in your case , Pad@@ re ,
Now , Pad@@ re , I like you . I really do . I like your son too .
But some things , you just have to stop them before they start .
Ambi@@ tion leads to a word they don &apos;t use much any more .
Pap@@ a , what &apos;s that ?
And I &apos;m Bri@@ ck .
I was there this morning .
When I saw you guys take out that whole house and walk out without a scrat@@ ch ,
Ye@@ ah . Why didn &apos;t you just go to the c@@ ops with this ?
And then there &apos;s Mc@@ Queen . Prac@@ tically illi@@ ter@@ ate .
But he &apos;s got a bit of an issue with authority .
That &apos;s a mighty fine det@@ ective job you &apos;ve done , son .
So you do know the O@@ o@@ die Brothers ?
I can &apos;t just bring them boys in &apos; cause some suit from Philadelphia wants me to .
The longer you stay down here , the more you &apos;re going to realise ,
No , Sh@@ eri@@ ff . Listen , I &apos;m just asking for , you know , a little cooperation .
Why don &apos;t you let me worry about my county ?
I &apos;ll drive us until I can &apos;t drive no more .
I know , right ?
What if we get there and Ro@@ b &apos;s a baby ?
Oh , that &apos;s smart .
Besides that , them bul@@ let sc@@ ars didn &apos;t look too fresh on Cel@@ este &apos;s belly .
What if there &apos;s more than one k@@ id ?
What do you want to know ? ! What do you want to know ? !
How about that ? I &apos;m gon@@ na say , &quot; You know what , I don &apos;t want Kevin !
It &apos;s a dam@@ n simple sm@@ ash and gra@@ b !
Dam@@ n ! Pla@@ in and simple ! What ? Sorry , Lincoln .
The last thing I need is for you d@@ umb sh@@ its to draw more un@@ needed attention .
Keep your ass off the grid .
And for the love of God , get rid of that dam@@ n cell phone .
You m@@ ess around and fu@@ ck up my pension , that &apos;s your ass .
H@@ ey !
It &apos;s on the way , man ! You want to win , put bub@@ ba in !

Nice .

Ok@@ ay .

H@@ ey , An@@ g , it &apos;s Jack .
I wanted to call you , see how you &apos;re doing .
I &apos;m just saying , if you want to know in the future
H@@ ey , Jack , it &apos;s Miguel .
Sofia was asking about you .
Th@@ ought maybe we &apos;d have you over ..
Will you give me a call back here at the rec@@ tory when you get a chance ?
What an as@@ sh@@ ole this guy is .
Let &apos;s go . Br@@ ing it in .
Holy sh@@ it .
And that &apos;s the truth .
Yes , Coach .
I got you .
I don &apos;t give a sh@@ it if we lose every fu@@ cking game this year .
Dis@@ covered that we &apos;re a pressing team .
As soon as they get over half-@@ court , we tra@@ p .
Any@@ where and everywhere .
Who says ? We can do whatever we want .
There you go . There you go . Stay with him !
There you go .
Br@@ ing it around . Stay on him .
You &apos;re gon@@ na let this rule m@@ ess with patient care ?
Thanks . Mak@@ es my day real easy .
H.@@ R. wants to talk to you today .
The an@@ onymous har@@ ass@@ ment complaint
Ye@@ ah , and , legally . H.@@ R. has to investigate ,
And if it &apos;s not ?
No contact with Mur@@ phy , ok@@ ay ?
We &apos;re starting to lose all our phase two moment@@ um .
Oh , you know what ? I got to gra@@ b a sensor .
Well , it &apos;s better than nothing
Oh , um , can you make it to round on Al@@ y@@ ss@@ a Cr@@ amer ?
Ye@@ ah , sc@@ ar revision .
H@@ ey , um , listen . H.@@ R. wants to talk to me .
All right . You good here ?
I understand that I broke a rule ,
Have you cu@@ dd@@ led him ?
Well , if I were left in a card@@ board box ,
He is like a puzzle that I can &apos;t solve ...
Did a h@@ ack job .
Um , I &apos;m going to re@@ open .
Did you notice anything about his mit@@ ral valve ?
Sh@@ ane , come on .
I found the corner pieces . I need help with the sky .
A par@@ ach@@ ute mit@@ ral valve ?
A a grown man .
And f@@ ailing . I &apos;m sorry . It &apos;s true .
Ok@@ ay . So you think this is about you ?
But it &apos;s not about you , either .
You have to really be delicate .
And , u@@ h , the act of me asking might be breaking them .
There was a complaint .
I thought it might be you .
I know , but it made me wonder
I didn &apos;t .
Oh , now that sounds like co@@ er@@ ci@@ on .
I didn &apos;t take it that way .
You &apos;re not just saying that to cur@@ ry favor ?
Because you never have to do that .
You &apos;re too good of a doctor for that .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll even be a doctor in 10 years .
Now , that &apos;s co@@ er@@ ci@@ on .
Who car@@ es ? I &apos;m doing an organ recovery .
I &apos;ll basically be on general , cardi@@ o@@ thor@@ ac@@ ic ,
Oh , for h@@ itting Rob@@ b@@ ins with a gur@@ ney ?
Ye@@ ah .
L@@ ooks good .
Gu@@ ys , guys , guys , the k@@ not@@ s are coming back .
I made D@@ ad play and we fle@@ w our dr@@ one into your face !
I &apos;m gon@@ na go .
S@@ it down !
But do you have to d@@ ump it on me when I &apos;m in a good mood ?
That &apos;s what the window is !
Sometimes it &apos;s longer .
Save it . I know where I &apos;m not wanted .
I can &apos;t waste the energy on that ,
No ! We are going to sit here in silence
For you .
And hurt St@@ ella &apos;s feelings ? Think !
Our children are hor@@ ri@@ ble .
I &apos;m the director of the Gil@@ bert Foundation .
Hal@@ f a million dollars !
Julia runs the selection committee .
Sorry . I have a st@@ ack of papers on my desk .
B@@ ye .
G@@ il got stuck in Peru .
R@@ ough terrain . Sli@@ ding down this hill ,
If it was anywhere near the tank .
We &apos;re in a ra@@ vine at the edge of campus ,
No sk@@ id marks .
L@@ ooks like he went clean over .
You know , I don &apos;t think this explo@@ sion
Here we go .
This looks like a det@@ on@@ ator , Ray .
Lam@@ bert didn &apos;t just drive into this ra@@ vine .
We got a point of explo@@ sion here .
K@@ iller wa@@ its for Lam@@ bert to leave the party ,
Let &apos;s get the frag@@ ments over to trace ,
The last time we saw
Ye@@ ah , well ,
I &apos;ve recovered a partial serial number
Company that makes
Sha@@ ke Al@@ ert .
What do you need with a de@@ af fire alarm ?
Fine .
Ye@@ ah , we &apos;re fine . We &apos;re fine .
Ye@@ ah .
Right before the explo@@ sion ,
You think it was the bom@@ b ?
The bom@@ b in Dr. Lam@@ bert &apos;s car didn &apos;t give us much ,
Pi@@ ece of a box .
You know , most ..
He &apos;s Julia &apos;s T.@@ A .
When I went to take Julia &apos;s statement just now ,
That means &quot; Sweet pe@@ a &quot; In L@@ S@@ Q .
Well , you &apos;re right , Se@@ an ,
But we didn &apos;t give you a poly@@ graph ,
During the test , we played a series of clicking sounds .
The sp@@ ik@@ es in your brain wave
You &apos;re also a k@@ iller .
So he fak@@ ed being de@@ af
Well , Se@@ an lied about being de@@ af ,
Some@@ thing that no one on the campus would understand .
I didn &apos;t realize how lon@@ ely I was .
And when we do ,
I &apos;m sorry , Julia .
Any@@ thing that might help us ?
But they sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be hard to get .
We leave tomorrow .
Get@@ ting out of the cell block
That &apos;s why I figured out the saf@@ est
The per@@ im@@ eter guards are less predic@@ table ,
It &apos;s the only way to avoid the je@@ ep pat@@ rol .
That should prove some dist@@ rac@@ tion inside .
L@@ ook@@ ed like he turned away ,
No , but it is
If we &apos;re going to get around these guys ,
There &apos;s only one real road that goes to the prison .
What ?
You said a week .
You want it ? C@@ ause I &apos;ll keep it .
We &apos;re gon@@ na have to watch both guards simultaneously .
Keep track of everything he does and when he does it .
What will you be doing ?
Go take a walk .
My last year of school .
He used to come around
He ist
What &apos;s going on ?
You need to sign in
Have you read the ru@@ leb@@ ook ?
Read it again .
We &apos;re gon@@ na meet someone from this company
You know that .
you &apos;d already be dead .
It &apos;s like you said you &apos;ve got something they want .
Right ?
All I know is it &apos;s my job to get you out of here .
W@@ ash my feet .
I don &apos;t know .
Please just give me a moment to think .
I need to be out of here by tomorrow .
That &apos;s my trip log , I &apos;ve told you .
I &apos;m doing everything they tell me , the same thing you are .
You know , before I was arrested ,
Well , they already found everyone I care out . Ok@@ ay ?
because time is running out .
Look , it &apos;s hot today .
Pre@@ fer the heat than the cold any day .
When this is all over , why don &apos;t you do it ?
Still , you can make it work .
he plays games , people get hurt .
But if he can &apos;t fix it , it might be time
Ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re out of order .
They &apos;re going to pull our plug !
R@@ alp@@ h probably fell as@@ le@@ ep
You &apos;re not from here , are you ?
I &apos;m just doing some work here .
Some routine cand@@ y tree tri@@ mm@@ ing .
In fact , this whole area
Cand@@ y tree department .
Ah , it &apos;s just me today .
Y@@ ep . That &apos;s right .
No . I &apos;m not a ho@@ bo , but I am busy .
What &apos;s that ? Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t hear you .
Listen , I tried to be nice .
S@@ our Bill , that gli@@ t@@ ch cannot be allowed to race !
Gu@@ ys ! She took ...
Or@@ -@@ e-@@ oh
Mil@@ k my du@@ ds ! It &apos;s W@@ re@@ ck-@@ It R@@ alp@@ h ?
Please . No . I &apos;m King Cand@@ y !
Sal@@ mon . Sal@@ mon , that &apos;s obviously ...
Just get me out of this c@@ up@@ cake ,
Well , this one did .
You gam@@ e-@@ j@@ ump@@ ed ?
What ? No , no .
It &apos;s not my fault one of your children
The G@@ lit@@ ch !
That was your medal ?
Well , I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t help you . It &apos;s gone , you know .
It will stay that way until someone wins the cup
Is that a threat I smell ?
If I ever see you here again , W@@ re@@ ck-@@ It R@@ alp@@ h ,
Fun dun@@ geon , you know ? It &apos;s a play on words .
Never mind ! I &apos;ve got a gli@@ t@@ ch to deal with , thanks to you .
This thing is hard as a rock .
Check her out .
But you have to back out of the race . Ye@@ ah .
So , y@@ e@@ ah , I &apos;m definitely racing .
Stop it ! Stop ! You &apos;re breaking it !
I just want to race like you guys .
And that &apos;s all you &apos;ll ever be !
Let &apos;s get out of here !
Before I throw you in the mud !
You &apos;re welcome , you rot@@ ten little th@@ ief .
I was going to give it back to you as soon as I won the race .
Just go back to your own d@@ umb game and win another one .
I won it in Her@@ o &apos;s Dut@@ y .
You &apos;re never going to break ..
Enjoy your little tan@@ trum , di@@ aper baby ?
Look , you want that medal , right ? And I want to race .
You help me get a new cart .. A real cart ...
You want me to help you ?
Come on . What do you say , friend ?
Oh , come on , p@@ al . You son of a gun .
R@@ alp@@ h , my man . My main man .
My arm &apos;s getting tired . Do we have a deal or not ?
Well , I &apos;ll say this much ,
Is he in there ?
Otherwise I would have sl@@ apped his cor@@ p@@ se .
G@@ ot to find it before it la@@ ys its fil@@ thy eggs .
Can &apos;t get a read on it .
Why did he go AW@@ O@@ L ?
Go@@ ing on about cake and med@@ als ...
&quot; Go Turbo &apos; &quot; ?
Well , back when the ar@@ cade first opened ,
I probably can &apos;t have children .
She just had her car@@ pet ste@@ am-@@ cleaned .
Mo@@ ve away . I &apos;m Asian and a man .
Well , H@@ an , actually , it &apos;s pretty dangerous .
Let him save the day .
My neck !
And that was my best feature .
You would &apos;ve burned your vag@@ ina .
Carol@@ ine , I know this might not be a good time .
But what did S@@ ophie say ?
She &apos;s seeing other men .
She &apos;s cl@@ assy .
She went to the island without me ?
O@@ leg :
Sa@@ ys the man who coo@@ ks the food .
U@@ h , it &apos;s our clos@@ et , why ?
I &apos;m always looking for places
I thought I sm@@ elled him .
O@@ leg &apos;s in the clos@@ et .
Re@@ ally , lu@@ is , O@@ leg is straight .
No , no , no , no , no , no , I work for a din@@ er .
Don &apos;t bring me into your drama .
It &apos;s my mother . She &apos;s on death watch .
M@@ ami , com@@ o est@@ a su lo@@ u geh@@ rig &apos;s ?
That &apos;s not what I was gon@@ na say .
We can qu@@ it after we learn how to work this dam@@ n machine .
Press here for an o@@ unce of grounds .
I didn &apos;t get that , did you ?
So you t@@ amp , pack , turn the kno@@ b ,
So what you &apos;re saying is it &apos;s easier to make met@@ h ?
You ever work with one of these ?
Well , I went to Harvard .
Small scra@@ p , ni@@ pp@@ le sla@@ p , half half .
T@@ all cap tri@@ ple@@ -@@ shot half ca@@ f ?
You should work at St@@ arb@@ u@@ cks .
This thing h@@ ates women so much ,
Or , to be honest , most of America .
U@@ h , what &apos;s your name ?
Can you two explain what this is ?
That &apos;s a penis wearing a hat .
Because it &apos;s bald and a little in@@ secure .
That state department agent wants to meet
Thank you .
I use when I come .
Come , it &apos;s in the boat .
Who are you working for , really ?
Never thought I &apos;d see this face again .
Why ?
And it &apos;s a mistake to lie to me .
I have a contact at the N@@ SA and she gave me proof .
I promised you I would never do that .
I knew I was being set up .
At least , that &apos;s what he thought .
You &apos;re not .
We got it , Su@@ c@@ re . Get to crete .
not unless he susp@@ ects you know who he really is .
You know him better than I do .
So , what do I do ?
As soon as you get a chance to get away with Mike ,
H@@ mm .
We spoke to our man at the Pent@@ ag@@ on .
Kan@@ iel Ou@@ tis has been located
What &apos;s the Navy gon@@ na do about it ?
So , when I was a teen@@ ager ,
And all of them were named Anthony .
Ah , y@@ e@@ ah .
Prob@@ able internal head trau@@ ma on that side .
Maybe he hit his head on the rocks ?
Prob@@ ably a pist@@ ol but@@ t .
That means he was dead before he hit the water
Or a body d@@ ump .
Ambi@@ ent tem@@ p &apos;s 97 , water &apos;s 107 ,
Well , air unit didn &apos;t see any other cars ,
How &apos;d he get out here ?
How &apos;s it going ?
Blood &apos;s not human .
Well , as soon as they develop
It &apos;s got a right-@@ sl@@ ant loop , a core and a del@@ ta .
I &apos;ve been downlo@@ ading
That &apos;s my go@@ at .
Ye@@ ah , the left horn is damaged , just like the one I found .
H@@ ey , did you get l@@ atitude and long@@ itu@@ de within the met@@ ad@@ ata ?
I was getting a little excited !
That &apos;s right down the road from Walter Bur@@ ns &apos; property .
And the nine millimeter
I &apos;ll ask him when I get there .
All right .
I checked out the owner of this place , Bill Gi@@ b@@ son .
His work card &apos;s on file .
It &apos;s not exactly a thri@@ ving enterprise .
What do you got , Nick ?
But he could &apos;ve fixed it by now .
Oh , and now you fol@@ ks
You want to understand ?
I don &apos;t see any evidence of
W@@ as@@ n &apos;t there a river in Ohio a long time ago
You know , I had a c@@ ousin who lived there .
Gi@@ b@@ son and Bur@@ ns tried to do something about it .
L@@ ots of sick people in Cable Springs .
Ye@@ ah .
Which is coming out when ?
And I &apos;m still missing one crucial piece of the puzzle .
So@@ unds like a sci@@ -@@ fi exp@@ le@@ tive .
And then give me a call .
I &apos;m not gon@@ na touch anything .
Those the results from the water samples ?
Hand &apos; em over .
The sli@@ des confirm Walter Bur@@ ns
Because maybe .. they were drinking bad water .
You see , it &apos;s the same tox@@ ins ,
If these chemicals are in the water supply in Cable Springs ,
And tell them what ?
I found it .
They drill until they hit gas@@ -@@ bearing sh@@ ale .
This creates mini@@ ature earthqu@@ akes
What happens to all the chemicals they put down the hole ?
Well , have a look at this .
Almost never happens without human intervention .
S@@ low le@@ ak . T@@ ire goes down .
And that takes care of Con@@ serv@@ o &apos;s only loose end .
Fir@@ ing one .
That &apos;s some blood on the lan@@ yard ring .
It &apos;s the same color as Walter Bur@@ ns &apos; hair .
So Bur@@ ns h@@ opp@@ ed the f@@ ence at Con@@ serv@@ o Solutions ,
He dro@@ w@@ ned in that pool ,
Which we confirmed by the blood we found in Co@@ dy &apos;s truck .
a Con@@ serv@@ o Solutions tru@@ cker with no pri@@ ors
He then takes a hit for the home team ?
Thank you , gentlemen .
What ? Seri@@ ously ?
No . They &apos;re not telling you . I &apos;m telling you .
Justice has been served .
For what ?
You don &apos;t need a sample ,
But this has nothing to do with that show ,
They know us better than anyone .
We must be missing something .
think it &apos;s a mar@@ ital aid , do you ?
A@@ my , how is this big glass shaft going to aid our marriage ?
H@@ mm . Hav@@ en &apos;t really thought about it before .
Rel@@ ax , H@@ an .
In fact , they &apos;re more likely to die
You think you &apos;re too good for the din@@ er ?
I think sour@@ d@@ ough bread is too good for this din@@ er .
H@@ mm , let &apos;s see . C@@ up@@ cakes ?
Don &apos;t go there , H@@ an .
Why so m@@ oo@@ dy . H@@ an ?
You know we have to bury those mit@@ ts now .
Prob@@ ably a 7-@@ 10 split .
It &apos;s like when you go to the zo@@ o ,
Your ball came into our yard again .
U@@ h , we &apos;re ro@@ le-@@ playing .
H@@ ey . J@@ ay Z ?
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah , baby .
He bought the Brooklyn N@@ ets .
I &apos;m not surprised that you &apos;re J@@ ay Z and Be@@ y@@ once ,
Oh , well , I &apos;ll tell you what I told him .
So that &apos;s basically our ball at this point .
Cra@@ zy in love ?
I wouldn &apos;t say that &apos;s all we are .
We also share a CV@@ S points reward card .
Can &apos;t you two ever do it over at O@@ leg &apos;s apartment ?
I have no idea where he lives .
No , with my busy work schedule ,
It &apos;s more than just the place
I don &apos;t have access to the p@@ ills I need
Well , let &apos;s see . We are kind of like a family here ,
And in my family ,
You know , what used to be known as good par@@ enting .
Come over tomorrow .
We can get@@ -@@ st@@ oned and watch a movie .
Well , those wig@@ gle shows do get crazy .
Ye@@ ah , and where is my hom@@ ey ?
I can smell the AX@@ E body spray .
I brought Sh@@ re@@ k , Sh@@ re@@ k 2 ,
What are you guys doing here ?
You said she was going to be at O@@ leg &apos;s .
You guys live with O@@ leg ?
As a wise person once told me ,
I don &apos;t understand .
Oh , I already did .
He fired me for missing 20 minutes of work .
Let it go , H@@ an .
I didn &apos;t fire you because you were late .
All right , well , apparently ,
Ok@@ ay , this is bad .
Well , maybe we can get a replacement p@@ ig .
I started hanging out at cir@@ cus bars until we met .
He was older , always in command of a room ,
He transformed me
No good@@ b@@ ye . No note .
I know it &apos;s st@@ up@@ id .
She &apos;s a fantastic mother .
He could never do better than that for a mother .
I think it &apos;s time for them to travel .
That &apos;s where my disappear bag was hanging !
You have to come back right now .
What ?
Until then , just act normal
That &apos;s going to attract attention .
Me , obviously .
Besides , you &apos;re about to start your new life soon .
That &apos;s something you like .
I &apos;d hire a n@@ anny , sell the house , down@@ size to a con@@ do .
S@@ ure , it &apos;ll take me a bit longer to finish college ,
I &apos;m not let@@ ting any@@ body else raise him .
Am I the only one un@@ settled
Oh , we forgot to put the apple the new p@@ ig &apos;s mouth .
Now that &apos;s your answer to everything , isn &apos;t it ?
I was a f@@ ool to think I could get through this
I just had to protect myself .
pure , raw potential .
The innocent way your shirt cu@@ ffs
We haven &apos;t heard from him since .
A reliable source told me where I can find him .
I &apos;m not going to call you .
Get Ru@@ iz out of there
You know me , I have a gentle touch .
What &apos;s up with the Cam@@ az@@ ot@@ z cra@@ p , hu@@ h ?
I miss you , man .
Come on , bud@@ dy , let &apos;s go .
Ok@@ ay .
What &apos;s with the get@@ -up , hu@@ h ?
To kill you !
You look good in pur@@ ple .
It &apos;s been a lot of fun .
What did they do to you ?
You &apos;re a good agent !
You mean , we don &apos;t all just des@@ erve a little gentle horn s@@ have
You always have been .
I think it &apos;s a beautiful face .
I don &apos;t know . Those were Ru@@ iz &apos;s last words .
Does it ring any b@@ ells ?
Mis@@ sed one .
You &apos;ll have to eat around the bur@@ nt bits .
If it weren &apos;t for the dead , I never would &apos;ve found you .
We &apos;re the line in the sand .
Gu@@ ys !
You know , maybe if humans weren &apos;t so ke@@ en
There &apos;s got@@ ta be another way .
There &apos;s got@@ ta be a world where mon@@ sters
That is not what I want .
I want the forgotten people out of the dark !
That is what I want . Give me an army like that
Now , please tell me where the fu@@ ck they are !
The infection rate is much higher than initially ...
Where &apos;s G@@ and@@ al@@ f ?
He said it was the only way to kill the Blood Queen .
I didn &apos;t take the sword .
Mr. Lincoln , you are full of sur@@ prises .
Dear Abraham .
Be careful , it can quickly disappear .
M@@ om , is it ok@@ ay , if Michael comes to the yard sale ? &quot;
I do like him .
Yes , when Michael took me to pro@@ m ,
