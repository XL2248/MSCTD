what are you ? some thief ?
if you bring z@@ aya back .
fo mortal could rob set 's vault .
but the journey through the nine gates
there may be a way .
no one may leave the after@@ life once entered .
no father could be more proud .
you are my children of iron and blood .

then , when i asked you to marry me , why did you say yes ?
it didn 't all sting .
nothing can fulfill me .
no one will know , until it 's too late .
that 's why ra was wise to ensure you would never have a child .
what ra gave , he took back .
why ?
what ra gave , he took back .

i think that 's wise .
you 're right . you 're right . i guess i just got so upset because ..

murphy 's law doesn 't mean that something bad will happen .
let 's lay her down right there at the edge of the reservoir .
nicely done .
get in .
we lost it . no , we didn 't
how long you think it 's been up there ?
so for ten years ?
why did it come down so low ?
i don 't know .
but only one to measure my son 's future ?
okay , well , right now we don 't need more engineers .
if we had any of those left , the doctors would 've been able to find
then she 'd have been the one listening to this instead of me ...
it felt like they made something new every day . some
well , we used to look up in the sky and wonder ...
which would have been a good thing , because she was always ..
and every last one of them trying to have it all .
at our place in the stars .
well , we used to look up in the sky and wonder ...
explain to me how you found this facility .
you didn 't expect this dirt that was giving you this food ..
we learned these coordinates from an anomaly .
you 're sitting in the best-@@ kept secret in the world .
what sort of anomaly ?
nobody stum@@ bles in here . nobody stum@@ bles out .
cooper , please . cooperate with these people .
you 're going to have to be specific , mr. cooper . right now
now , i 'm real happy that you 're excited about gravity , bud
you know my father , professor brand .
when they realized that killing other people was
in secret .
when they realized that killing other people was

our final expedition .
get out there and save them .
who 's " they " ?
the last components of our one versatile ship in orbit , the endurance .

my crash . something tri@@ pped my fl@@ y-@@ by-@@ wire .
and it leads where ?
and whoever they are , they appear to be looking out for us .
they 've put potentially habit@@ able worlds right within our reach .
someone placed it there .
you sent probes into that ?

data transmission back through the wor@@ m@@ hole is rudi@@ mentary .
hence the bravery .

there 's a plan a and a plan b
the first gravitational anomalies changed everything
both . fl@@ an a. " how do you get it off the ground ?
both . fl@@ an a. " how do you get it off the ground ?
but you haven 't solved it yet .
the problem is gravity . how to get a viable amount of human life off the planet
after that , with surro@@ g@@ acy , the growth becomes exponential .
this takes care of that .
this takes care of that .
but what about the people here ? you just ..
i will have solved the problem of gravity .
go ! if you 're leaving , just go .
mankind was born on earth , it was never meant to die here .
this world was never enough for you , was it , co@@ op ?
mankind was born on earth , it was never meant to die here .
i need to fix this before i go .
the why of the thing , that 's the foundation .
then i 'll keep it broken so you have to stay .
mur@@ ph , look at me .
then i 'll keep it broken so you have to stay .
that 's right , mur@@ ph .

it 's a perfect planet , and we won 't find another one like her .
no . no attachments . my father insisted .
adri@@ ft
she 's pretty upset with him for leaving .
he sent you a message .
she 's already making fools of her teachers .
so maybe she should come and make a fool out of you .

the next time you hear from cooper , they 'll be coming up on saturn .
so where are they ?
heading for mars .
you all right , rom ?
i 'll try again next time .
you all right , rom ?
no , it 's just that all the illustrations i 've ever seen , they ...
say it , don 't spray it , rom . it 's a sphere .
what was that
so they say you want to go from here to there .
how ?
how ?
transmitter failure ?
miller 's site has kept p@@ inging thum@@ bs up , as has dr. mann 's .
it 's what we 're calling the black hole .
maybe . he was sending the thum@@ bs up right until it went dark .
the gravity on that planet will slow our clock compared to earth 's drastically .
how bad ?
landing there takes us dangerously close .
how bad ?
how bad ?
plan a does not work if the people on earth are dead by the time we pull it off .
you can 't just think about your family . now you have to think bigger than that .
plan a does not work if the people on earth are dead by the time we pull it off .
yeah , do@@ yle , we have a mission , and our mission plan a is ..
no . it doesn 't . that 's why there 's a plan b .
that would be spent trying to get back here .
you don 't find that every day . no , you don 't .
that would be spent trying to get back here .
all right , which is here , just outside of miller 's planet .
here 's gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ a . here 's miller 's planet .
then we take the ran@@ ger down , we get miller , we get her samples .
okay .
instead of taking the endurance into orbit around miller 's planet ..
a literal heart of darkness .
then let 's succeed
nothing escapes that horizon .
it only has to work once , mur@@ ph .
we 've done wel for the world here
i want to talk to my daughter .
can we take this point up at another time ?
and i don 't understand why .
it suc@@ ks in asteroids and comets , other events which would otherwise reach you .
murphy 's law . whatever can happen will happen .
we need to go further a@@ field .
and yet ... yet here he is .
but maybe we 've spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory .
you 're a scientist , brand
when i say that love isn 't something we invented . it 's ..

we might have something for that . hey , co@@ op .
unless you 're punishing me for scre@@ wing up on miller 's planet .
the dust .
your fuel calculations are based on a return journey .
if you 're wrong , you will have a very personal decision to make .
starting a colony could save us from extinction .
we were trying to reach you .
ust how good it can be to see another face .
i hadn 't a lot of hope to begin with , but
i let you all down .
the last time i went to sleep , i didn 't even set a waking date .
hey , co@@ op ?
i have a suggestion for your return journey .

all right . let 's take it slow , sir .
the rangers found you with only minutes left in your oxygen supply
we brought ourselves .
so .. when i made my suggestion to miss cooper ..
it was just constant . just that steady blow of dirt .
i was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect .

not a red di@@ me or word of my work to a single one of them , you included .
so yes , the person must have known the contents of the will .
well , vo@@ ila !
i submit har@@ lan told you everything .
har@@ lan told him that i could beat him at go .

it 's like kissing someone who 's drunk .
unless ...
you 're not gonna give up the money .
this one is designed to blind ,
a second bomb .

i mean , it 's everybody 's job to keep you alive .
i mean , it 's everybody 's job to keep you alive .
feel free to take any of this personally .
you 're also a little hard to swallow .
you should have been the moc@@ king@@ jay nobody has to tell you what to say .
showing them that you 're alive .
it 's just stuff my family brought .
the last the rebels saw me i was lying on the ground .
we will shoot more pro@@ pos right here in 13 .
when we win this war we 'll fly you in for the surrender .
i 'll do whatever you need me to do .
put her in the rotation .
why would coin do this ?
especially with all this going on@@ .it 's going to set him off .
they promised a free election .
we 'll keep him contained .
but you 'll throw support to someone would it be her ?
than these pro@@ pos can be done without you .
that look
only one thing you could do now to add more fire to this rebellion .
i 'm planning for you to have a long life
i never wanted to kill you .

i doubt all 3 of us are going to make it out of this .
interim ?
interim ?
sun 's coming up .
exactly how long is that interim ?
but , it 's clear that people are far too emotional
hundreds of his accomplices also await their deaths .
a symbolic vote .
