at least i can do is .
perhaps not a doctor .
i don 't know any of them .
a bunch of scenergy .
bastards .
and to fund his operations ,
what the hell is someone gonna do with a giant worm ?
what can 't you do with it ?
i wouldn 't bother .
sounds like a duck hunt to me .
a decoy . a diversion .
why would they want just this one when they 've got the keys
and we are the cause .
but like all living organisms ,
they are part of the earth 's natural defense system .
but if governments are allowed to contain them , destroy them ,
unless we restore balance .
a dead , charred world , overrun by monsters ?
moscow , london , washington , d.c .
on every continent , the titans are triggering
their behavior has become random .
no . signal 's too weak .
how many nukes do you have ?
we could help him .
is where king ghidorah is nesting .
so this plan is what you would call a " long shot , " right ?
you ain 't hear ' em , griffin ?
we 'll be out of range while you 're down there ,
all citizens to report to the nearest evacuation center
massive storms and other disasters
the grim search continues , as people around the world
cities around the globe have fallen
the creatures just think it 's another apex predator .
i mean , we are a bunch of horny murderous carnivores .
we track it , we find it , and we get my daughter back .
godzilla will bring balance .
we got about 12 minutes before he goes thermonuclear .
i 'm saying in about 12 minutes ,
it 's hard to find them .
i guess the danger would be failing god 's operation .
check this out .
yeah .
i 'm sure you 're gonna come back here , cam .
welcome .
i need you to dress and leave .
this is a good movie .
you know what 's gonna happen .
i don 't know what to do .
i really don 't know what 's gonna happen .
i didn 't have a choice .
i 'm not proud of god to change my help ,
i 'll change that .
and then i knew that would be single ,
you will not be approved to god 's plane .
steve , what is it like to be ?
it 's like mirror realm to have a raven in lunit .
