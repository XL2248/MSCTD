a decoy . a diversion .
why would they want just this one when they 've got the keys
and we are the cause .
but like all living organisms ,
they are part of the earth 's natural defense system .
but if governments are allowed to contain them , destroy them ,
unless we restore balance .
a dead , charred world , overrun by monsters ?
moscow , london , washington , d.c .
on every continent , the titans are triggering
their behavior has become random .

all citizens to report to the nearest evacuation center
massive storms and other disasters
the grim search continues , as people around the world
cities around the globe have fallen
the creatures just think it 's another apex predator .
i mean , we are a bunch of horny murderous carnivores .
we track it , we find it , and we get my daughter back .
godzilla will bring balance .
we got about 12 minutes before he goes thermonuclear .
i 'm saying in about 12 minutes ,
it 's too hard i couldn 't find a way ..
i guess the danger would be perfect , you know ?

i need you to put on some clothes and leave .
that 's a weird movie ,
you know what 's going to happen next .
" i don 't know what to do . "
i really don 't know what 's gonna happen .
i didn 't have a choice .
i can 't prague god to me ,
i would change that .
and then i knew that in the sins ,
you don 't get god 's approval from you .
