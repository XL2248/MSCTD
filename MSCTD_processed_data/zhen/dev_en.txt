apparently they have a thing like how you and your sister
phil , look , i really appreciate this . i do .

second of all , there is a picture of you .
i 've got a meeting .
margaret , you 're gonna take alex .
phil , honey ,

this whole c@@ live thing wasn 't even necessary .
romance strong as ever .
i 've got too much going on to even think about it .
you know , he 's a rich musician ,
... this has been fun , but we should , uh ...
oh , my god . is that rain@@ er ?
that sounds che@@ at-@@ y .
why ? what do you need them for ?
you keep them in here ?

so , i heard there was going to be this big ice-@@ skating party .
despite our failure in russia ,
he 's a french national who 's been trading illegal arms
for years , he 's worked hand in hand with his brother , david .
david didn 't want his brother
oh , that poor lady . does anyone know if she 's ok ?
if mar@@ quez finds those plans and sells them to az@@ ar ... boom !

yes ! love berlin .
we also have intel from mi@@ 6 .

well played .
i 'm here to make sure your dinner party
i 'm thinking ...
i 'm thinking you need a te@@ sto@@ sterone patch .
you know , cock@@ tails ,
hate to miss that .
oh , leonard .
one , two , three , four , five ,
they made me reveal confidential information
i can 't tell you that .
well , come on , we won 't tell anyone .
it 's bad luck for the pun@@ ters that they lose their money .
ru@@ uck !
i 'm alright . i 've just ... . just got a flat .
nah , all good . i got it .
do you know that you 're the la ..
why don 't you and your dead@@ beat husband
i can 't just stand by and watch this happen .
have you made that call ?
once you start , there is no going back .
she knew the consequences and she did it anyway .
you want my money or not ?
quarter of a million dollars .
we didn 't have to kill her , did we ?
we could have used that money to pay bruce .
very convenient .
hey .
i want more .
i 'm off
your business is your own .
you got some proof for me ?
what , you don 't trust me anymore ?
answer to all your problems .
too much .
nobody makes a fool out of me .
i don 't i@@ ke the sound of that .
you wouldn 't be playing games with me , would you , jack ?
ad me worried for a moment .
jet 's make it 200 .
you wouldn 't know of any good bars in the area , would you ?
hi , bruce .
oh , she hasn 't showed up for work yet .
you know anything about a crash ?
no . should t
this thing has insurance job written all over it .
well , that 's the easy part .
hot a chance .
i 'll keep the memory card
isn 't that over your wife 's dead body ?
you 've got a bad attitude .
of course , she 's fat@@ ter than my elephant
" life is nasty , bru@@ tish and short , " as the man said .
i 'd have got on rather well with hob@@ bes .
they 're a wealthy pittsburgh family .
now , the thing is , there 's a young woman staying with them ,
what a pesti@@ l@@ ence they are .
telling them what they want to hear . precisely .
exactly right . and , of course , she 's a pretty young thing
b@@ rice cat@@ ledge 's sister caroline
doesn 't he know that scientists are among the easiest to fool ?
i mean , i watched every move , and lord knows ,
but you hate holidays .
and besides , you 've always loved the south of france ,
the usual headaches , resistance in the room .
you 've always had the measure of me , oli@@ via .
yes , you were very impressive .
of all my nep@@ he@@ ws and ni@@ ec@@ es , you 're the only one , stanley ,
if only you had a slightly mil@@ der disposition ,
yes , he means he can tolerate me .
oh , hello . stanley .
george . char@@ med .
they 're a great deal less gul@@ li@@ ble
have you heard of her or ...
and i omitted to mention she 's here with her mother .
she held my brother 's hand , and she actually made the table rise .
i thought maybe , wrist lifts , but they weren 't there .
as i was saying , your mother and your brother
oh , not very . i have business elsewhere .
ah , now , is this the girl that can read minds and such ?
it 's hard to explain . she gets these mental vibr@@ ations .
drink ? thank you .
now , sophie looked into my eyes
good heavens . you think she can do it with me ?
she can predict the future . in short , she 's a visionary .
she 's a visionary and a vision .
pretty young thing with a stage mother who handles the promotion ,
well , i mean , she 's not even a good actress .
well , i thought that was quite good ,
and yet , she 's a fraud , howard .
there are five senses , and no spirit world .
and now , you 're refres@@ hed .
i 've had my share .
you have the far east on the brain .
good evening .
i was receiving some mental impressions . excuse me .
i had an uncle who drowned many years ago .
there 's absolutely no way she could know that unless
there was nothing supporting this candle , no threads , no wires ,
" apparent , " i think , is the key word .
i mean , i grabbed the candle and found absolutely nothing supporting it .
what you see out there is what you get .
good morning .
i 'm going bir@@ d-@@ watching with b@@ rice .
i can 't think of a more in@@ ane activity ,
where ?
we could have lunch . chat ?
you think you 'll trick me into showing you how i deceive people .
i 'm sure b@@ rice cat@@ ledge can live
i could just as easily ask you ,
even if their hopes are false ,
i wonder if you get your cy@@ nic@@ ism from your grandfather ,
why are you staring at me ?
you 'd be happier if i was a fraud ,
if you knew how much i don 't want you to be a fake .
how could you know about jenny ?
a wonderful laugh .
but who wants a pessimistic bore
lots of money .
we 're talking half a billion dollars .
not a good position you find yourself in , is it ?
you 're just caught in the middle , aren 't you ?
that 's what i thought .
absolutely .
i feel like i can get through to him .
i imagine he needs it in there .
michael suffered from a couple of things .
sorry . i 'm not familiar with the term .
but where we just process the image of a lamp ,
their brains are more open to incoming stimuli in the surrounding environment .
we have to do it in order to keep our san@@ ity .
do you think michael 's a genius ?
the loss of both parents very often does that to a child .
he became very att@@ un@@ ed to all the suffering around him .
he became a rescu@@ er ,
if 's in my nature to want to help .
you did a lot of good things before you were in here .
what happened ?
all right .
who ? a@@ very ? no .
maybe .
okay , fine . your work 's suffering so bad ,
maybe next time , you keep it to yourself .
in a marriage ? yes . you keep your mouth shut .
she has what , uh , if you squ@@ int real hard ,
yeah , she had that incident with the hole in the gloves .
i didn 't know how much it fre@@ aked her out .
she 'll be p@@ iss@@ y , but she 'll get over it .
she 's on her service .
i need to put a gastro@@ -@@ j on the schedule .
that means i have to work late .
and to the people who count on you for support .
thank you .
did she ?
and you 're gonna be invited ... plus one .
no , bri@@ des are weird . go think about something else .
okay .
well , if yang can get her act together .
please .
we 're not talking about me . we 're talking about him .
he has a very nice father .
this is a baby .
i mean , he 's a baby .
do you think that because i have kids ,
now you want me to shut down my entire study ,
you don 't have to actually date the woman she chooses .
that 's why she 's doing this , stan .
you need to tell her yourself .
because she list@@ ens to you .
besides , this is not such a terrible idea .
a bunch of women she scared up on the internet ?
it 's taking her mind off what 's actually happening .
she thinks she can find someone to replace her ?
nobody can possibly replace .. her .
why is this happening ?
i can 't . i don 't have a conduit to put in him .
i don 't know if he 's gonna last that long .
okay , let 's put him on an oscill@@ ator .
as they were incorrectly slic@@ ed ,
the supermarket was out of my regular fabric sof@@ ten@@ er .
that 's thinking ahead .
that 's just remembering .
amy 's changed .
oh , no . why ?
but recent events indicate that
no , it 's chil@@ ly outside . didn 't bring my jacket .
what kind of super@@ hero needs a jacket ?
di@@ bs on the red ti@@ ghts ! "
you got a number for a cab ?
bet i got you beat .
there 's no way you could beat this one .
happy birthday !
you know , food for the worms ?
20-@@ something years ago ?
there is no river 's ed
unless you like old wives ' tales .
don 't sho@@ vel that shit to these kids , lucky .
if you believe stories for idi@@ ots and mor@@ ons .
it 's a long shot , but we mapped something a few days
see this path through the forest ?
stop right there .
look , don 't get the wrong idea .
what the hell is that ?
the deed you have to this house is
they shouldn 't be here , nick .
you said you 'd been sw@@ inging a hammer in here for years .
i 've been trying to tear it down .
you tell you friend to run as fast and as
and you run with him , and never come back .
you come back here , it 'll be the ast thing you 'll ever
what the hell are these guys ?
ryan ?
what ?
he didn 't say anything !
get the fuck off of him .

yeah , well , they know how to throw a fucking axe .
or he 's just some hill@@ billy lun@@ atic who thinks the state 's
oh , shit !
trust me , no one .
forest , ra@@ vine , car ?
come on , we 'd never make it by dark .
well , i would rather go into the woods than stay inside
we don 't need to broadcast ourselves .
hey , hey , hey , hey , hey .

it 's so good to see you with your eyes open .
30 minutes ?
uh , he and l@@ ill@@ ith went to the van .

you said you never wanted to touch him ' cause you never

i think you 're looking at a door
wanna give this a try ?
they 're all over the place .
they 're all over out there , just looking
where the fuck do we go ?
we only have the cellar .

come on .
where the hell are we going ?
you mean , if you hope it 's still there .
like se@@ th knew his real name .
we gotta find the girls .
what are you doing ?
come on , we gotta find the girls .
it 's a poison angel .
come on .
we can find .... we can cover more ground .
there 's a glossary of demons .
she is the queen of hell .
they can feel stress , remember ?
that 's all it is .
he 's just fre@@ aking out ' cause i am .
it 's me , evi@@ e .
don 't make any noise , ok ?
we have to go to the house .

i saw the two of you in the courtyard this morning .
he started with me .
not me .
who wanted him dead besides you ?
how many times have i had you at gun@@ point ?
hell
we only been out here a minute .
the sooner whist@@ ler dies ,
what difference does it make ?
no more surprises , lincoln .
can you get any more pictures of sara ?
you didn 't tell him .
can we get pictures or not ?
he seems a little sensitive to me .
leave my son .
is that what this is ?
yeah , i 'm sure it was really hard
i was looking forward to seeing you
made up your mind yet , alex ?
once the special
what about a special prosecutor ?
it 's a form@@ ality .
this is just a form@@ ality ?
but the justice department
you 've made a lot of mistakes in your career .
i 've got eight files in my office att@@ esting to that .
i know who killed that man .
lec@@ hero
convenient
escaping together , but properly this time .
well , well .
where were you these past few days , huh ?
nothing .

that doesn 't look too bad
he 's gone south a long way from here . i 'll take you to him , i promise .
get up . we 're leaving
i was gonna do that anyway and you would 've heard me
you wanna know so bad
it 's starting to hurt .
let 's put that band@@ age back on .

what 's wrong with australian money ?
it 's paper . it 's worthless .
it 's a piece of fucking paper !
how much you need , man ?
yeah
thank you kindly .
you act like they 're doing you a favor to let you work there ,
i know everything , jerry .

on friday night . i 'll pick you up after work .
or just meet there , then ?
there 's a show
this is exactly who you are
what do you think ? david lost it .
i don 't believe you .
i told him you were leaving ..
because you wouldn 't have .
what , she didn 't come to pick you up ?
hey , i 'm here as a friend . nothing else .
move over .
but funny ,
why would you keep that a secret ?
i was ashamed , okay ?
and i hated what i did .
so that 's it ? you 're just gonna walk away ?
but i 'm not gonna spend my entire life proving that i am .
you don 't fight for love .
no . i 'm just missing home .
it 's slow and it 's painful , but it works .
going out with other people , seeing friends .
anne , please .
uh , no , i didn 't .
it 's why i called helen and she said she never got my letter .
how could you have fallen this far ?
two tickets .
this isn 't over , t@@ ade
and i don 't think you have either .
do you love him like you love me ?
no , it must have been keith .
when the cd player blew , we had to bring all the records downstairs .
what are you doing in here ?
oh , look at this . you scrat@@ ched it .
dad , they 're just records .
he 's not here to ask , is he ?
tried to warn you .
i know it 's not your fault .
isn 't that always the way ?
in a gospel band .
me and my gib@@ son and jesus were gonna rock the world .
those were the days , though .
what 's with the clothes ?
i meant why are they folded ?
o@@ oh , what 's this ?
o@@ oh , i have an idea .
oh , that would be so much fun .
o@@ oh , and get our hair done , and slow-@@ dance .
you went to seven pro@@ ms ?
uh , four " under the seas , " two " enchan@@ ted evenings , "
she and amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing .
ever since i saw pretty in pink ,
but then i saw never been kissed ,
ber@@ nie 's really excited .
you know , if you 're not gonna learn how to do this ,
bruce wayne doesn 't make his roommate tie it for him .
there , perfect .
it 's my first prom , i want to do it correctly .
i was , but penny didn 't want to .
bern@@ ade@@ tte , amy ,
was that a fl@@ ask ?
i 've decided to embrace all of the traditions
oh , no , this is pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate juice .
so , anything else planned for tonight ?
getting our picture taken , slow-@@ dancing ,
it 's gonna be off the hook .
why would you say that ?
because a lot of people lose their virg@@ inity on prom night .
is this true ?
you don 't have hormones .
try not to touch it when you 're dancing .
where are you going ?
you 're making me worry .
what 's going on is we 're about to go to a prom .
what pressure ?
can you please open the door ?
leonard and penny also made comments about it .
even i looked twice when i saw my posterior
she passed me the man@@ is@@ che@@ witz ,
so , my mother 's okay with this ?
because they have a weird , inappropriate relationship .
if you pull this off , you can come up to my room later ..
just make sure we get paid .
now , we 've been negotiating this for months .
i 've agreed to meet you here .
be right back .
let me give you a little bit of advice .
watch your step with that thing .
don 't i know it .
planning the invasion of nor@@ mandy .
on a strip of beach ..
what i 'm getting at , g@@ ret@@ chen ..
as the moving parts on the ground executing it .
michael
so where 's your new best friend ?
but whist@@ ler 's not who you think he is .
you 're the first that 's ever done that . gr@@ aci@@ as .
you could choose not to .
michael sco@@ field left me for dead ...
what is spanish for " little angel " ?
who worked for the company for about ten years .
do you know what sc@@ yl@@ la is ?
so he was going to make a copy of it and give it to me .
you 're looking at major time .
so how would you like to walk away from it al ..
if you help me find her ..
i 'm sorry , she 's not my department , sc@@ yl@@ la is .
it seems to me ..
of course .
only a few people in government will know of the operation .
or people 's lives will be in danger , mine included .
i 'm going to get you help .
yeah , but maybe you can .
fernando su@@ cre , and brad bel@@ lick were arrested .
and alexander mah@@ one is in a colorado jail cell .
and you 'll have me .
whist@@ ler also said something about a second step ,
but it 's encrypted .
so , we 've got a data card , which could be anywhere .
the location of which has yet to be determined .
he heard from contacts that i could be trusted .
why now ?
okay ? when whist@@ ler was killed yesterday ...
but , uh ..
so this is like job security for you ?
you can collect your pension .
okay , some people still care about their job .
maybe you 've been a little too distracted ..
if we take this deal , we 'll both be dead ...
you guys must have some big@@ -time friends .
somebody just posted ...
you can 't hide .
how high is your threshold for pain ?
we 're gonna go into the night .
lighter somehow .
i don 't even know who they are .
no more updates .
welcome to los angles .
you need to keep your heads down and your ears open .
all the basic necessities to get you up and running .
on a cop 's salary or pulling weekend gi@@ gs as a driver .
he 's highly paid .
and taking six figures from a private security company ..
and then i can pick the guy out from there .
mexican desert , 60 miles south of us border .
oh , i don 't want to die out here .
why don 't we rest here for a while , huh ?
si , that sounds good .
to san diego .
what does that mean ?
what if we don 't have to be in the house ?
maybe the guy is carrying it on him .
heavy hit@@ ter like that 's gonna have security 24-@@ 7 .
without anyone knowing it 's gone , right ?
you don 't steal the card .
oh , now you 're interested in what i gotta say , right ?
not only do you have to steal it .
only if you don 't got me , hom@@ bre .
this is the reason i got bu@@ sted .
i 'm looking at federal time cause i stole a cell phone , seriously ?
it looks like a cell phone but it 's really like ...
wireless hard drive that sw@@ allows up any electronic data ...
like what ?
of anyone at star@@ bucks with a lat@@ te and a laptop .
i can walk out of here and get the identities .
on a slow day , with one hand on my junk .
if we can get close enough ...
i shame you in front of your co@@ workers here .
could be anywhere , i don 't know .
right ?
you know , if you go down this road .
then i better not get caught , right ?
i don 't know what i 'm gonna do .
we just got to keep talking . san@@ cho .
our empty bel@@ lies and our dry mouths , okay ?
let 's start with , uh , your@@ -@@ your favorite color .
why should the both of us die out here .
you don 't want to do this . please .
san@@ cho .
it must be in there , right ?
in that house without being seen .
well , if the card 's in there , how we gonna copy it ?
she 's gonna do it for us .
" there is no fighting her . "
i 'm a teacher , and i have books and grading materials and ...
in a wagon one of these days .
it has so many pockets .
oh , no .
ah , thank god , thank god .
yeah , my damn truck blew a gas@@ ket a few miles back .
we 've been receiving some , uh ..
we 'd like you to check the windows , please .
all the windows ?
every room in the house .
does she still have the bag ?
she 's got it .
i need to know who .
former aid to governor frank tan@@ cred@@ i .
we looked everywhere .
like i said , i can 't read the content ..
doesn 't matter if we got it if we can 't find it .
it 's still inside the house .
she must have found it .
and then she left it behind .
you know how many months ...
what , you just think i can whip up another one in a couple seconds ?
if they find it , that 's the problem .
what do you mean , done ? what does that mean ?
are they gonna kill us ?
if we had a few days , we 'll figure out a way to pull this off .
yeah , you gather right .
you gotta throw us a bone .
what you 're asking for requires involving additional people .
i cannot do .
no , what i 'm asking for is competence , okay ?
in the hands of a damn maid .
that 's it , michael , that 's ball game .
about the company , what ..
you know , uh , the one thing i remember most ..
always walking out the front door .
mom , us , himself .
was his belief that the company needed to be taken down .
then this is our fight , not theirs .
these guys chose to be here .
they got a choice .
where the brothers were allegedly sent .
and no one has been released during that time .
i 'm just trying to find out who .
i know you b@@ ailed them out .
how 's that ?
because you 're gonna say you 're fine , that you can handle it .
i 'll just leave it at this .
whenever you want to talk , i 'm here .
you were gonna blame yourself .
and , i can 't bear the thought of that .
and just wipe the slate clean and no guilt and no responsibility ?
i don 't want it to be out of a sense of obligation .
because of what we 've been through .
start over .
our flight time to atlanta is approximately 52 minutes .
so what did you do last night ?
all right , here we go .
we need to get a move on .
i am sw@@ amped . i can 't just leave .
we don 't work at the salon .
u@@ h-@@ huh . i 'm sorry .
did you say i act like my job is life and death ?
yeah , that 's right .
which reminds me , i have a customer waiting .
no , i 'll call you later .
david , you 're zoning out again .
so let me get this straight .
dead men don 't sweat , do they , doctor ?
have a trace of blood , as well .
what 'd you find in his pockets ?
this old notebook ,
see how far you get .
maybe you ought to keep that to yourself .
yeah . yeah , it 's worth a shot .
half the people that work up there are the walking dead anyway .
uh , i got the dna results .
ho@@ dges has a proposal :
he also wants you to know
that 's all you have for us ?
but not without one big , fat scandal .
at least until one of his students
so the government didn 't want to step on the toes
there 's got to be a connection .
he still receives a government pension check .
hello , doctor .
dr. aden ?
you got the wrong guy .
we found something of yours .
ban@@ ished me from university property .
it 's phil@@ o far@@ ns@@ worth all over again !
in the pocket of , uh , this young man .
u@@ h-@@ uh .. he 's dead ?
actually , the young man in question ...
the la@@ zar@@ us myth made real ?
it 's , uh ...
in your , um , re-@@ animation experiments , doctor ,
could almost reach out and touch it .
the ma@@ el@@ stro@@ m .
except the third person looks like a woman .
what have they done ?
dr. aden , slow down .
no need to add baggage to your trip .
it 's going to be an adventure .
see you on re-entry .
max 's friends kur@@ t and alice .
see who his co-@@ pilots were .
you know , in the movie altered states ,
you wouldn 't want to go ven@@ turing ，
i noticed some faint bru@@ ising that started to develop
hand marks . he was held down .
so drowning is cod ?
yeah , great for a hit@@ ter , bad for pronoun@@ cing death .
what are you looking for , doc ?
the way you 've got it set , it wouldn 't pick up my heart@@ beat .
you 're lucky you 're not ben@@ ched .
why do you ask ?
well , i would have to know more about
i want you to look at something .
tonight , we free ourselves from the physical plane .
she 's got some academic honors awards ,
doesn 't take a detective .
o@@ oh , another one of dr. aden 's note@@ books .
dr. aden said this was going to end badly .
le@@ t-@@ s hope there 's still time for alice .
it is a dat@@ e-@@ tag match to a formula
right .
so how did alice get it ?
he and alice were e-mail bud@@ dies .
when her mother died .
alice saw an anonymous commen@@ ter
so she e-mails ,
so , here . kur@@ t 's just wandering campus .
some kind of interference .
i 'm working on isol@@ ating the competing image ,
are we looking through alice 's camera ?
where is she , and what 's she doing ?
what , a car stopped for her ?
wi@@ pers , off .
ap@@ u fire protection test button , check .
climb to 3,900 meters , sichuan 86@@ 33
this toy is for you .
please sit tight and fasten your seat belt .
it 's 12@@ 3.7 . goodbye , sichuan 86@@ 33 .
check .
continue to climb to 9,200 meters .
returning to chengdu .
be careful of the turbulence .
please fasten your seat belts .
we will make an announcement when there is more information .
we still need confirmation on this .
years later ,
and that is how people learned that fel@@ icia till@@ man ,
i like anything that 's not orange .
your settlement check came in .
after all these years in prison ,
what ? to your old neighborhood ?
none of your neighbors supported you during the trial .
oh , i don 't hate them ...
and so my husband returned to wi@@ ster@@ ia lane .
they hadn 't thought about paul young in years .
and he was going to make sure
the letter that arrives by special courier ..
yes , there are all sorts of ways
why do i have to tell them ?
trustees of the hospital feel
" great block party .
again , very sorry .
he is gonna be so angry !
you 'll never guess who 's back !
how is paul even out of jail ?
hello , ladies .
i 'll tell you the story .
it 's a good one .
why are you so surprised ?
oh , wait . that 's right .
i told myself i 'd explain how i was framed
innocent or not , that guy still gives me the cre@@ eps .
and he 's using my shower .
you here for your 9 iron ? damn , i thought if i sha@@ ved ,
you look a little pa , buddy . something wrong ?
jack , what 's going on here , man ?
let 's just go inside , hmm ?
then we 're not telling ga@@ by ,
she has to be told .
but i don 't know how .
n@@ ope . i was wrong . pre@@ ston ,
when rene@@ e pulls up to this house ,
it 's so ... co@@ zy and intimate and ...
you 're learning a lot of new words for " small . "
sometimes weeks go by without me
ly@@ net@@ te , why so mean ?
drive slower next time .
it 's all right . we 're just old friends re@@ connecting .
they work from their own homes .
that sounds like a dream job .
you said you had money problems .
unto martha for selling her dignity
look for yourself ! she 's on camera three !
just some family photos .
so are you gonna be okay ?
i lost my business , and i 'm sitting here
i 'm sorry .
it 's for the best .
well , whatever you do ..
good-@@ bye , b@@ ree .
i 've been thinking about our conversation last night .
i 'm fine .
i found myself a project .
i wanted to spit in your face .
that 's right . you 're not used to prison .
you 're giving me a lot of reasons
i 've become a bit of an expert thanks to you .
it never hurts to tip the guard does your cavity search .
whichever is easier .
they always record the conversations ,
that 's a crazy , groundless accusation .
i have things to do like shopping
uh , absolutely fear@@ less .
yes , rene@@ e was always the one with the fashion sense .
i 'd never even heard of gu@@ cci or pra@@ da .... .
or ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia .
and .. somebody got hunt .
oh , it 's not about the money .
you were adventu@@ rous .
it 's just hard for me to reconcile
why would she do this ?
two guys , huh ?
i mean , isn 't her life perfect enough ?
so was it one rugby guy and then the other ,
you know , i have shiel@@ ded you
she doesn 't get to be disappointed in my life .
yeah . you 're right . you 're right .
pork ch@@ ops for dinner .
something wrong ?
without that money , i can 't hire any help .
we 'll never get out@@ ta here like that .
the wine tasting ?
as you may have gle@@ aned ,
no , no , of course not .
hold , please .
we knew they 'd shoot that down .
they have the luxury of being unreasonable right now .
their witness line@@ up is better , and they know it .
we 're here .
we 'll see you in court .
hi , sofia !
i 'm so sorry about this .
i 'm thinking pan@@ cakes for breakfast .
let me have a look there .
getting fluid in her abdomen .
this baby 's barely viable outside that womb .
you can repair it , can 't you ?
throw in a plasma patch , hope for the best .
then a patch is the way to go .
now you 're confident in a plasma patch ?
ke@@ p@@ ner ?
stay in your lane , dr. kare@@ v .
i 'll update the mom .
well , she 's still in surgery but doing great .
and the baby ?
it 's too little to be born , right ?
i-i need you to sign one more form
morning ! come on in !
i 'm sorry . it 's been a really rough morning .
cal@@ lie and i swap all the time .
could you please tell the court the tally at the bottom ?
we know she was out with you at least 25 times .
now , let 's just pause and think about this for a minute .
150 out of 180 .
sustained .
so , cal@@ lie 's okay slu@@ t-@@ sha@@ ming me now ?
they 're making it sound like a working mom is a bad mom .
all you gotta do is come and get it .
god damn it , be careful with that !
that cost a lot of money ,
no one 's got a fuc@@ kin ' name like os@@ good .
i try to behave like a gentleman , dor@@ is .
you think less of me , don 't you ? for walking out
i say that ' cause i think it 's the truth .
i lec@@ tured on economics at yale .
i was the national golden gloves champion three years in a row .
jesus !
i lie alo@@ t .
shall we say 7 : 00 ?
it fuc@@ kin ' worked ! it really worked .
you said i was a co@@ ward and my breath was bad .
what was that , man ?
he@@ h , women , they like honesty .
all right , fresh from the bank ..
what 'd i miss ? the special specimen .
okay , she 's dead , but she won 't lie down .
i could get a key to a $ 1,000 suite .
give me something i can cherish to remember .
okay . thank you . come on .
discs , tapes .
even if he denies it , it 's something .
it 's a bit late for that .
then you 'll be sub@@ po@@ en@@ a@@ ed and forced to repeat this whole story .
then i 'll give them this .
aren 't you , frank ?
don 't look so shocked . what did you expect ?
except you 're not working for lang anymore .
you know all this is poin@@ tless , don 't you ?
good evening , sir . ha@@ ther@@ ton welcomes you aboard .
it 's my first time in a private jet .
hi , man .
yes , sir .
leave it off for now .
mike would never have believed such cra@@ p . he was too clever . too loyal .
how do you know that ?
do you mind if i don 't think about that ?
i 'm not jealous .
but at least i know she 'll be having a long day at work .
i 'd like to see you get back under 145 .
pu@@ ke .
somewhat ironic .
can you lift your shirt ? so i can examine your stomach ?
these scars are still pink .
you did this in mexico so your parents wouldn 't know ?
and you noticed her foot twit@@ ching ?
my foot .
about three months ago ?
we took her to county hospital , and she got the c.@@ t. scan ,
a lot worse . they don 't have the proper equipment back home
right away .
yeah , and thanks for it .
i didn 't give it to you . it 's all over the hospital .
disease , diagnosis , and prescription from one man .
this is not gonna make me go home .
but i feel fine .
what ? are you trying to get her in trouble ?
george , this program will make or break our careers , okay ?
and that decision depends entirely
he 's the attending . he should know better .
it didn 't exactly sound like
i think so , dr. shepherd .
here you go , doc .
we 're gonna put this on your arm , okay ?
here , we 're gonna put that onto you , like that .
this is a butterfly .
m@@ mm , there we go . blanket for the butterfly . good . nicely done .
hey , you like spac@@ es@@ hips ?
you do ? okay , should we take captain o '@@ mal@@ ley ,
it 'll be safer to wait until your lunch di@@ ge@@ sts
where did you get the idea to do this ?
honey , there is a healthy way to lose weight .
what are you eating ?
most of the time , when people hit their target weight ,
it 's ... stressful .
i could focus more on my studies .
life doesn 't work that way , claire .
what ? you want to argue this ?
left untreated , the disease is gonna kill her .
too soon .
the treatment requires the dise@@ ased portion
her brain 's not fully developed ,
there are risks to any surgery ,
look , i know this is a lot to digest .
thank you .
yes ? what
are you in , or not ?
good .
we 're gonna cut out half a girl 's brain
almost makes it hard to hate him .
oh , no reason .
you know ?
she knows .
we need to free the bo@@ wel from the adhe@@ sions caused from the ab@@ sc@@ ess .
what was she thinking ?
she wanted to please her .
great .
she gets good grades .
she 's smart .
come on , taylor , she 's waking up .
uh , he 's asleep !
dr. taylor !
my bad , sh@@ ep .
aw , i nodded off . come on .
ste@@ ph , get me some coffee .
i 'll be fine . it won 't happen again .
uh , ste@@ ph , call dr. penn@@ ington .
get out of here and get it together .
does that mean you believe he 's innocent ?
whether it 's just or not
and we will be here with you throughout the night .
how long until ..
are his lawyers making any progress ?
there 's only one person who can really stop this execution .
just to tal@@ k.@@ for five minutes .
ok ..
i 'm told that you have to wait until final vis@@ itation .
believe me my father knows where i stand on the death penalty
this is ..
just talk to lincoln 's attorneys
and if i 'm the one asking for cle@@ men@@ cy for your brother
yeah but a secret infor@@ mant claims that stead@@ man is still alive ?
you 're his clerk just get us on the doc@@ ket .
if he grants it he can order a stay until the tests come in .
no way .
we studied for the bar day and night in that c@@ rap@@ py little apartment of yours
come on ly@@ le everyone knows you run that courtroom .
the infor@@ mant that was killed yesterday i was there .
all we 're asking is to be heard .
thank you .
he knows you tried .
so yes .
enough man all right .
back up or i 'll beat your skin@@ ny ass into the ground .
all right ladies re@@ c time is over . back on the block !
and i will collect .
thanks .
let me worry about my problems .
once about 10 years ago
and it may sound crazy
so if something happens to the chair
a new death warrant another medical clearance .
yo what scrap@@ es yo ?
i know time is of the essence .
these little bast@@ ards are the bane of my existence i swear to god .
yeah they 're attracted to the heat when they 're cold
not by chewing on the wire alone but if the tail touches metal
so can you change the fuse ?
can you do it now ?
yeah .
make me .
hair gets in the way or something .
i know you did .
remember derek ?
i said make it $ 100 .
she 's supposed to be coming .
i got to get my head straight .
i can 't take it anymore .
i have to see him .
you 'll never make it through the gate .
i had a dream last night@@ .you and me were working on a house
it was so clear . the whole dream .
i know it .
him him ?
what the fuck is he hoping to find with these losers ?
they 're total slu@@ ts here .
no manager . just the girl .
yeah , we 're coming , we 're coming . who 's there ?
at the tim@@ one d '@@ oro ?
sergio needs to finish something for work first .
two details that will soon be resolved , fab@@ ri@@ z@@ io !
and you 'll go back to tar@@ an@@ to dirt poor .
it 's so old-fashioned ! i haven 't touched coke for a good ten years .
no , i understand .
nothing . you weren 't talking .
... sergio mor@@ ra .
you do everything you can to get yourself noticed .
well , i like to keep busy .
but they 're not enough anymore .
darling , could you look after the boy a moment ?
lu@@ ig@@ ino , why don 't you drive around over there ?
i 'm saying that we lost
all those broken promises ..
his collabor@@ ator sentenced to nine years for ties to the mafia .
he goes abroad and says ,
isn 't that true ?
he 's 70 years old , cup@@ a .
i know where you 're headed ,
fuck you , san@@ tino .
what the fuck ?
i 've never cheated on sergio .
you 're a piece of shit !
because i 'll tell them everything , san@@ tino ,
do you have any wishes , sergio ?
yes , i know , i know .
where the hell are they going to go with that pathetic majority ?
are you bored , love ?
shall we do something after the bag@@ ag@@ lin@@ o show , darling ?
yeah , ger@@ i was delighted .
this cost me 300 euros and it looks like shit .
if only all you needed was a top to make the difference , love !
let 's hope this shit doesn 't go on too long . oh , god , here we go !
how did you know , sil@@ vio ?
an inde@@ fati@@ g@@ able lover of my calibre
on one condition .. that you don 't om@@ it her name .
tam@@ ara mor@@ ra . do you know her ?
a good-@@ looking woman .
she urged me to stand as your successor
whoever is not with me is against me .
two things . the salesman is a lonely man .
so put that aside , but don 't forget it ,
augus@@ to pal@@ lo@@ tta , head of sales at pal@@ lo@@ tta real estate ltd .
yes , ma 'am ,
neither do i , ma 'am . if i 'm calling you now ,
yes , ma 'am , everyone dreams of owning a home .
not because the weal@@ thi@@ est man in italy ,
so if all these in@@ ferences of yours are not the reason ,
the problem is that , while i waited for you , i remembered something .
what the writer javier mari@@ as said about you .
he said that when you attend international summits ,
i studied whist@@ ling technique in dubai .
and i brought her here because she 's dying to meet you .
dear ver@@ onica ,
i have a favourite writer as well .
i don 't give a shit . round them up . you 're drowning in debt , fab@@ ri@@ z@@ io .
you 'll help me ?
i can understand that .
it seems that a sort of handbook has been drawn up ,
i do as i please .
at least your jokes , sil@@ vio . could you at least avoid telling jokes ?
what about churchill , then ?
was that less mel@@ o@@ dramatic ?
" you were good , dear , just a shame i couldn 't hear anything ! "
fine , but remember that this b@@ im@@ bo
maybe that 's why i felt the need for compan@@ ion@@ ship .
fine , sil@@ vio , fine .
we 've had enough of it . and you want to know something else ?
it 's not true you 're as skil@@ ful as you say you are .
you are so naive !
do you think they 're all blessed with righteousness except for me ?
they 're all like me .
but i did it better than the rest of them , because i am the best .
but i have a duty to be completely honest with you .
if i come back later , it 's because i won .
why won 't they let me govern ?
instead the lef@@ tist judges tor@@ ment me with trials ,
what did you expect ?
yes , that 's exactly what i expected .
or maybe i never got on it .
a few days ago , in some magazine ,
they all look like ver@@ onica .
one day there was a girl here .
i approached her and she said to me ..
" anchor . "
i believe i can do that for your viewers
i studied journalism at the university of texas .

you 'll decide for yourself what you believe .
let 's see then . where to begin ?
don 't let the stories and pretty lies fool you , boys .
my dear apa believed himself part of the new india .
he used to lie in bed w@@ rac@@ ked with pain ,
religion was the only tin@@ k she had to her past .
ur religion was the only link she h
challenge . i give you two ru@@ pe@@ es .
you must be thirsty
why would he send his own son
but we can understand god 's son ,
but god wasn 't finished with me yet .
and so it was he introduced him to me again ,
but the sound and feel of the words brought me closer to god .
who gave you the permission to come back here ?
i-i just wanted to say hello to him .
he 's an animal , not a play@@ mate !
when you look into his eyes ,
you stupid . say " i 'm sorry . "
i am sorry .
this is between a father and his sons .
scare them ? that boy almost lost his arm .
he will be a man sooner than you think .
come inside and have some din@@ er .

it 's my bed .
don 't you see the island was carni@@ vorous ?
yes . the whole island .
but at night , some chemical process
i couldn ' leave without him , of course
i knew he wouldn 't be ate
and you won 't read about those trees in any nature book .
and if i hadn 't discovered that tooth ,
even when he seemed indifferent to my suffering , he was watching .
and gave me a sign to continue my journey .
my strength was gone , i was so weak .
i struggled to shore , and fei upon the sand .
and somewhere , two eyes were smiling , that having me there .
the cook ... was a dis@@ gus@@ ting man .
we had food enough for weeks ,
but he was resource@@ ful
" ni@@ pol@@ a ! "
couldn 't look away ...
he threw her body over@@ board ,
e didn i even fight back , he knew he 'd gone too far
i 'm not making anything else !
i 'd play your dragons or whatever if you asked me to .
you 're serious ?
i don 't know , i 'm just saying that i 'd play if you asked .
can you hang on a second .
it wouldn 't kill you to wash a dish either .
my brother is a s@@ nar@@ ling ball of anger and my sister is ..
good times .
she just wants to play with you .
dave , u 're on that thing all the time .

but then you 'd be old .

i like to own the things i use .
yeah , i 'll see you back home .

so , you guys have done what you needed to ?
well , you just said you 've done what you needed to do .
i 'm not exactly sure , you know . i just got here at 4 : 00 .

trucks 14 through 23 are on the road .
nick , the gas@@ ket 's good . you should get over there and get going
but also know that i have never taken anything from anyone .
we 're on the same side here .
pretending like the elephant per@@ ched on the corner of my desk isn 't there .
but we believe that you and your company have broken the law
it 's a little awkward , obviously ...
you know , out of respect .
but know that you 're wrong .
abel !

she was playing with it .
it was a fucking go@@ on with a loaded gun looking in our window .

how far back are they going
one other thing . the bank .
i want you both there . just be up front . be honest .
god knows they 've given money to bigger cro@@ o@@ ks than us .
it 's not like when we was driving
he feels very strongly about it .
i don 't think he fully understands .
well , first of all , it 's illegal .
my responsibility is to provide ..
we cannot stay like this any longer .
we 're so weak right now .
because i 've got my entire savings at risk on this deposit .
i mean .. this . why do you want it ?
yes , i 've thought about it . i 've thought about it every day for the last five years .
i 'm not talking about that place .
i have no idea what you mean .
here you go .
i understand and i apologize . i do .
let me check something .
i 'm gonna fucking kill this guy .
abel . he 's saying it 's a bad time .
anna morales .
i understand you and your men have a job to do here .
excuse me ?
we 're not who you think we are .
good for you .
not even close .
i would start treating us with a little more respect .
he will make it his mission in life to ruin you .
and you 're not gonna find a fucking thing .
six , what are you doing back here ?
you come out under the bridge . it 's a park .
you 're welcome .
it 's still up on the bridge
it 's 16 . someone shot up his truck on the 59th street bridge .
seven months . six and a half
because you said that you would be there .
one with 16 counts of misconduct .
and then today , in the middle of our meeting
for your assistance in attempting to bring in the driver .
yeah , well , the officers there didn 't set it up very well on their end either .
miss lan@@ ge .
that it might be beneficial on your end
so we have prepared an offer for you to review .
it 's good , andrew
of course you do .
but i need more time .
after a very frank conversation ..
as you know , there are plenty of other smaller providers in the area ..
peter , thank you .
i guess i kind of knew what i was doing
that 's great .
i told them that their dad was out there
and that there was no man
of course .
you 've grown .
i know . i know . but you have .
i don 't know how you get any work done around here .
your far rock@@ away facility bought a load of fuel .
that 's not possible .
just thinking about the co@@ wards that have done this ..
do you have any receipts over the last year ...
so i 'm gu@@ essing there 's at least , what
i said . 2@@ 13,000 .
okay .
i ... i-i only bought a couple loads .
this may ruin me .
but if you 're this fucking desperate
all right , well , when you find out who else did it
or you 're gonna have the fe@@ ds at your door@@ step by noon .
we are not nice people to borrow three quarters of a million dollars from .
you know , i 'm ... i 'm gonna think about this .
can you believe it ?
let 's go .
why don 't we just spend the night here ?
i know .
that 's not true .
you want me to put anything in for you ? !
oh , good ! i got that new stain stick to try out !
okay , i see what you 're getting at :
because there we also have a hometown buffet .
yes , quite the ker@@ fu@@ ffle .
walked right out the door .
enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price .
right next to it !
why 's that ?
you 're just repeating what i said .
trust me , call her .
i was this close .
you 'll appreciate this .
tell him you 're not mad at me .
enter wes@@ ley crus@@ her , played by my buddy ...
boy , if these walls could talk .
i can 't believe i 'm not going to live here anymore .
right here is where my mom used to mark my height .
seventh grade .
ninth grade .
when did you figure out you were allergic to nuts ?
okay .
yeah , i guess .
go on ahead .
we 're not standing outside by the u-@@ haul
what brings you in ?
are you finally getting fu@@ z@@ z in weird places ?
it 's cal@@ med the pants off me a couple of times .
so , the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble ?
someday , scientists will discover
look , just apologize .
the core problem is that amy and wi@@ l do not like each other .
and i like them ,
not true .
and let me tell you , that was a hard row to hoe .
boy , that is a treat that 's hard to beat .
you might want to pace yourself .
i think i know what i 'm doing .
i have a card for emergencies that i pay for myself .
that 's a pengu@@ in i sponsor .
what is pink cheeks ?
maybe you should find someone
no , absolutely not .
that is a foolish expense , and i forbid it .
you 're talking about me . very funny .
wait , wait , who 's gonna break it to the pengu@@ in ?
yeah , i 'm putting you in charge of my finances .
very well .
you can 't buy one .
i should hope so .
there 's got to be other ways you can make a quick buck .
o@@ oh , maybe i could sell my blood and sperm .
here , let me help you .
my mother in korea is working
uh , max , do you wanna move in ?
stand up to her . you 're a 5@@ 3-@@ year-old man .
what ?
what do you got , a case of the benjamin buttons ?
what ?
yes , what makes you think i 'm older ?
that car just exploded in front of those two girls ,
i don 't know . i mean , it 's kind of a big deal .
well , i 've apologized about it twice .
yeah , i could have died ,
it 's violence against women .
talk about violence against women .
at least she won 't make me feel guilty .
well , at least your f@@ anny pack
hair flip and go .
now , look who 's walk , walk , walking with purpose
really ? ' cause i went to movie jail with han .
we have a mu@@ g shot .
that 's right , han@@ -@@ nie and cl@@ y@@ de ,
an un@@ obstructed view of my sweet , sweet ass ?
what a selfish thing to say .
i was pretty bum@@ med to be paired with a fresh@@ man .
i 'm going to be your spirit guide .
no problem .
i like your sweater .
congratulations .
i 'm happy you decided to join us , son .
yeah .
um , i would love to , but i think if i want to be employed
very easy . point and shoot .
no , i 'm fine . this will be comfortable .
i 'm setting the alarm for 5 : 00 a.m. , okay ?
i have $ 20 set aside for breakfast ,
i 'm a little bit more of a visual learner .
let me just pull it up really quick .
in the back .
wh@@ oa , wh@@ oa , easy .
i 'm jar@@ rod . so where you headed ?
can i come ?
anywhere you want . this isn 't ap@@ ple@@ bee 's .
if you 're gonna shoot your shot ,
can i get the sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti and me@@ at@@ balls please ?
we don 't really have a side salad .
okay , just the burger then is fine .
thank you .
that was nice .
could you drive us to the closest bus station ?
i mean , closest stop is probably amar@@ illo .
that 's true . hop on in .
um , i don 't know if we have time for that .
let 's do this !
here we go !
looks like 23 's losing control !
into the wall . 23 is out for the count .
there go your ride right there .
yeah , we 're trying to get to the bus station in amar@@ illo ,
oh , thank you , wow .
do you have any more of those sprink@@ les ?
is it for someone special ?

for the rest of her life ?
oh , he@@ y. do we still have that tram@@ pol@@ ine in the garage ?
i would be up in my room , reading ,
hi@@ . hey , mike .
no , no , no . slow down .
i already have .
oh , god .
oh , my god . oh , my god ! it 's from him .
hu@@ gs and kisses .
i 'm going to call him .
um .. what else didn 't she tell us ?
did she tell you she can hold her hand over an open flame without crying ?
but it 's not all her fault .
i 'm back . who 's ready for dessert :
i 'm chann@@ eling my anger into cleaning .
you do realize that scar@@ ing those people off doesn 't change anything .
you can 't imagine how many people want this baby .
i 'm sorry . it 's my grand@@ child .
matt , drink for my friend here .
whis@@ key , straight up .
jerry .
not much of a tal@@ ker , huh ?
what do you do for a living , jerry ?
if 's like she doesn 't realize this whole thing is killing me , too .
that 's why she won 't stay out of it .
when it comes to her kids ,
and if you son@@ t through all the times in your life that she drove you nuts ,
i know .
that 's a pretty good one .
well , some people at school think that 's inappropriate to do on the playground .
no , no , no , no kissing ryan anywhere .
first , kissing , then get married , then he buys me presents .
honey ...
all right , guys . no more junior var@@ sity bull@@ shit .
something billy won 't see coming
how are we going to do that ?
vic@@ ki , are you crying ?
if it makes you feel better ,
hey , max , if i 'm going to die tonight ,
and i missed you . i missed our friendship .
and so , i did some really bad things
tina .
look , man , i got this , all right ?
billy murphy was a kid who went to camp here years ago .
he was always picked on for being different , ugly .
and then one summer , the hottest one on record ,
legend has it billy still lives in these woods
i wouldn 't count on it . let 's move .
speak for yourself , girl .
you 've had like 15 of those in the last 30 minutes
let me eat my feelings in peace .
do you hear the words in your head first ?
my shift 's almost over .
and what beautiful rounds they are .
honey@@ . they don 't find mud . mud finds them .
eh , a few days .
realizing how big it is , how quiet it is ..
now .. you tried destroying the neighborhood .
i don 't know what i wanna do .
no , no . phase two is about the future , not the past .
oh , my god ! look behind you !
oh . hey , fel@@ icia .
and here i was concentrating all my pity on the dead people .
yeah , we understand beth gave you a kidney ,
but that kidney gave me a second chance in life ,
to us , our decor@@ ating firm ,
tomorrow , not walking in on mr. del@@ an@@ ey
well , $ 290 after this champagne .
why is the glass always half empty with you ?
i just got my budget .
that would be huge for our company .
this might be a good way to sne@@ ak in
this may be the dog sham@@ poo talking ,
hey , room@@ ie !
those are beautiful .
they felt terrible about breaking your mirror .
oh , you haven 't been upstairs yet .
but look how beautiful .
well , i needed to get your attention .
oh , don 't try to make this my fault .
yes , but breaking into my car is criminal .
i 'd love to get a policeman 's opinion on that .
oh , my . you are a policeman .
girls , get back here !
and i will not give up .
neither will they .
good to see being married to the boss gave us the leg up .
sorry about the wait .
closed a deal worth $ 10 million . phy@@ ll@@ is ?
the overall look we 're going for is very warm and inviting .
that sounds great , but i already know what i want .
this is donald trump 's office .
then i remembered that p@@ ant of her was still alive somewhere .
smells good .
right . you said you were cooking for him .
well , just trying to be a good friend .
you do ?
i know what you 're thinking .
and now i just want things back to normal .
i wouldn 't begin to know how to make a pot pie .
but don 't tell paul , okay ?
i know how to keep a secret .
" initial symptoms include nausea and vomiting .
as if he had one .
death . "
it just goes to show ...
but we 're still one hec@@ k of a team .
i don 't get it . he just keeps getting worse and worse .
you 're a good friend .
hey , swee@@ tie .
no , i have to get this done .
mrs. van de kam@@ p says those are for after dinner .

i 've got two dragon lamps in my car .
i 'm sor@@ ry@@ . but trust me ,
tom said what he thinks he wants .
and you have to admit ,
what ?
i guess you found someone to loan you that gun .
i spoke with the girls . they 're pretty sure
why would they say such a thing ?
ga@@ by ? what 's with the pan@@ icked ph@@ o calls ?
the girls got all fre@@ aked out and called the police .
i think i know what this is .
they must have gotten confused .
it 's hard on kids when their parents are apart .
i mean , not " funny " funny , but sad ... funny .
hey , girls ...
let 's go pack your stuff . i 'm taking you home .
i 'd have felt pretty dumb
when i heard the address , i said , " i 'll take it . "
your neighbor , mrs. till@@ man . here 's my card .
okay .
i 'm a detective . i find clues . i don 't give them .
good night , detective .
i can 't believe you told them .
i told her the truth .
we have to face it , ga@@ by .
so what am i gonna do ?
i feel guilty enough about carlos losing his mother .
no , that 's not cool .
if you don 't eat , i can do it today .
no , i ... did not .
it just seems like it 's a lot to do all at once .
it 's an all-@@ or-@@ nothing approach .
some will be a snap , but there are a few tricky ones ,
we 'll get it .
um , it 's sort of like trying to get past level six .
we will eat all those dots and kill all those ghosts .
oh , i switched with kno@@ x .
uh , i don 't know if we met before i left .
i got you that pizza stone .
yeah , i got you , a , uh , a circular clay stone
the crust that always stick to the edges never get burned .

10 blade .
ready with tumor number one .
already going great . one down ..
he was diagnosed already stage iv .
he ignored his symptoms ,
well , you 're right . he is a typical teenager ,
what ?
that way we 'll be able to reach tumor number two .
it 's a plastic bl@@ ob@@ .i 'm starving .
when will the model be done ?
that long ?
if you want it faster , page god .
like an actual vascular graft ?
in japan , they 're 3-@@ d making condu@@ its
why can 't we do that ?
he wouldn 't need surgery after surgery
we fix the hole .
it 's just a routine complication .
everything 's under control . we 're good .

those are things mark slo@@ an used to say
you know , i convinced him to start teaching you .
hand them the keys .
i know . it 's just so fun .
right sm@@ ack in the middle of the liver .
skip it ? why would we do that ?
no , we planned this surgery in an order .
alex , if we remove the other ones first ,
it 's the hardest one .
but you 're seeing other people , obviously .
i 'm so sorry . that was way too personal .
i 'm just not used to it .
well , then , come work here .
we 'll isolate the vessels ,
i don 't know if you can , mer .
nice work , you guys .
do we need both ?
if there 's a breakdown somewhere in the an@@ ast@@ om@@ osis ,

so , uh , wilson , as i inject air into the n.@@ g. tube .
i 've been stuck in this bed ,
ready to get back to my feet and ...
i lost myself there for a while . ke@@ p@@ ner .
there won 't be enough functioning liver to support this kid .
you print one damn fork , and now you think
and i need this conversation to be over !
is that how the decision 's made ?
what ?
no , no , between you and me .
listen , the whole fucking game has changed .
fuck that ! i fuc@@ kin ' love this place .
what are you gonna do with the rest of that ?
no , buddy , you got to drink every drop of that . you know why ?
it 's true . go on . put it away .
so ...
oh , i remember . something did happen .
tim@@ my . he 's the kid who 's always trying to trip me .
so i pun@@ ched him in the face .
jimmy .
is that why you think you got in trouble ?
you got to learn from these things , right ?
get in trouble because you pun@@ ched this sne@@ ak@@ y br@@ at in the face . not at all .
jimmy ?
no , that 's absolutely what i should be tel@@ lin ' him , ba@@ be .
it 's not what you do , it 's when and where you do it ,
yes , i follow .
that 's exactly right .
it didn 't happen .

i 'm sure the officer didn 't stop us by accident .
in fact , i am .

i couldn 't have said it any better .
and no one 's gonna raise an eye@@ brow
you can 't kill anybody , jimmy .
no , i didn 't know .
we fuc@@ kin ' buried rats , especially our own .
i knew he had his sources .
but obviously , he had a plan .
hey , steve . hang on a minute .
can i trust you , ste@@ vie ?
good .
what can i tell you , billy boy ?
would you say winter hill was thriving ?
which meant we had to pay off a lot of people ,
we were throwing money around like crazy .
yeah , " fuck me " and fuck you is right .
jesus , john .
in five fucking years of
fuck that . this , on the other hand
jimmy always had a plan .
now , that was a smart play ...
off our backs .
situation down there was changing , and not for the better .
thank you , alan .
john cal@@ la@@ han has us poised for great success .
well , they fucking love it , ste@@ vie .
but who knows for how much longer with wheel@@ er moving in ?
but at least we still got this .

no dragon can resist the alpha 's command
witness true strength .
in the face of it ,
but , please , o great dragon master ,
it wasn 't your fault , bud .
why do you ask ?
oh , my god , that 's so generous !
well , our friend ra@@ i moved into my old room ,
bever@@ ly , you know i hold you in high esteem .
very well , but , uh , if you don 't mind ,
you 've recently moved in with dr. fow@@ ler , yes ?
clearly , your old room represents an escape hatch ,
and don 't start thinking about it now !
she said defen@@ sively .
this is about rai@@ esh moving in with leonard and penny .
they 've found a need to take yet another roommate .
i had no idea
that is the word on the street , dear .
i haven 't been here one day , i 'm already causing problems .
that 'd make a nice need@@ le@@ point pillow .
that 'll do it .
look , could you please put your dog on a le@@ ash ?
well , then at least hold her still
thank you . i appreciate that .
what are you talking about ? we 're fine .
it used to be me .
anyway , i 'm sorry for everything .
we don 't have marital problems !
look , just because we took our friend in does not mean
shel@@ don mentioned you tried to get your brother
do you agree with that ?
are you kidding me ?
now you 're taking her side ?
that 's for your parade of room@@ mates to do .
it 's me ! it 's just me !

i don 't have the card ,

i came in in ' 94 .
always freelance .
i like to finish a job and then move on .
do you always leave your name behind
well , we 're considering modifications and ..
you know what happens ?
you don 't own it anymore .
then , somehow you stayed out of trouble .
look , i can handle this .
i 'm just kicking myself .
this thing has gotten way out of hand .
you don 't trust me , fernando ?
because we all want the same thing : sc@@ yl@@ la .
or would you like me to call the bomb squad ?
if that thing blows while i 'm pulling the pin ,
i 'm known for my steady hand .
keep your weight even .
oh , no , i can 't ... i can 't , i can 't do it .
i got a key .
baker gave you this ? no .
all right , well , this makes more sense .
they 're micro@@ phones .
this is a line of j@@ z@@ 33 land mines
it 'll cut the power long enough for you
i found david baker .
you can do it . you only have
michael and i figured it out .
but by next spring , she will be a trained alpha ,
learn to keep the peace .
but . but ..

you wolves are making us look bad . come on , the cari@@ bo@@ u are laughing at us .
western hunt group , get back to the den .

they can always eat
berries are really nutritious .
the eastern wolves ruined kate 's hunt .

i 've never seen her look that good .
i 'll be right back .

you 're not allowed to ho@@ wl with her . she 's an alpha .
but we can 't , you know , ho@@ wl together .

w@@ ow@@ . it 's a big crowd .
so i heard you and gar@@ th spent some time together .
sorry .

excuse me . a fle@@ a .
thank you .
good-@@ bye ?
and maybe i 'll visit our friends the bears .
i 'll tell them you said hi .
yeah . you know , it 's alone wolf thing .
so i 'll be a fun@@ -@@ loving lone wolf .
i saw this coming a few years back .
thought i was dreaming .
and i needed you .
that trum@@ ps what you need . it 's too late , buddy .
you know what i need ? i need a shave .
even dis@@ assembled , i wanted to please him .
where would we go once his plan was complete ?
" to the garden . "
when than@@ os snapped his fingers ...
no one 's ever seen anything like it .
on this planet .
the quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe .
hope . she 's my , um .
she was supposed to pull me out .
sorry , buddy , we got a problem .
well , what are we gonna do now ?
i just got hit in the head with the hul@@ k .
this was our shot .
it was six stones or nothing .
you 're repeating yourself . you 're repeating yourself .
no . you never wanted a time he@@ ist .
i dropped the ball .
is that what i did ?
there 's no do-@@ over@@ s .
each .
b@@ ye@@ -@@ bye , you 're not going home .
then no one else is going home , either .
i said bring them in .
oh , for the love of ..
it 's not lightning strikes we 're looking at .
that is a long-@@ hor@@ ned bee@@ tle .
hair . maybe he got a piece of his attacker .
yeah , okay .
yeah , same thing over here .
stop , please stop !
do you see these abra@@ sions and cuts here in the chest ?
the place was completely tr@@ ashed .
i was the one who wanted to get married at the convention .
all of our friends were going to be here , anyway .
let 's go back to
vam@@ pires , an@@ d. unfortunately were@@ wolves .
may i see your hand , please ?
we found the same scar
and .. no returns .
how many of these have you sold ?
um , out of curiosity ...
really none of your business .
it 's a terrible thing to wake up to every day .
your wolf 's in the system .
hmm , how original .
wolves don 't normally attack humans .
who 's the owner ?
yeah , someone drank michael wilson 's blood
no . it did not come back to kur@@ t francis .
if we accept the mythology , were@@ wolves don 't drink blood ,
don 't they hate each other ?
i understand why the were@@ wolves
maybe michael lost faith .
you wanted her all to yourself , didn 't you ?
the yellow contact lens
but without the murder weapon , we can 't prove
the clothes should prove it .
you know , there should be a lot more blood than this .
well , at the least , they were there .
he was hit with an axe at least 18 times ,
or another vampire .
there 's just one draw@@ back ..
what did you find , david ?
we didn 't find any of this stuff at the crime scene .
we know that michael was running from his attackers .
where did it begin ?
your beloved used to be a were@@ wolf .
said he knew we were destined to be together .
love built on a lie isn 't love .
he wasn 't one of us .
did it ?
that was really intense .
oh , good . you 're here . i need your assistance .
what happened ?
been there .
amy 's mad at me , and i 'm not clear why .
yes .
what 'd you say to her ?
and that made her angry ?
it was . i asked her
i 'm gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment
if i 'm in , i 'm in for the whole run ,
i shouldn 't have asked so many questions .
yeah , maybe it 's good you got us talking about this stuff .
even when i 'm causing problems , i make the world a better place .
uh , shel@@ don , i think we 're good for now .
so does this mean you 'll finally pick a wedding date ?
why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date ?
a ceremony isn 't gonna change anything .
it 's his wh@@ ining , isn 't it ?
look , all she 's saying is we are in love
yeah , but we 'll be old and gross together .
towards the end , it was like watching cheese melt .
are you saying you want to get married ?
i 'm in . let 's do it .
i 'm really happy for the two of you .
ber@@ nie , stuart just pulled up .
show no weakness .
good luck .
never should have told you my middle name .
hey , you got a minute ?
i felt bad for finishing your yogurt , so i bought more .
crunch berries .
i want you all to realize that the only thing
and you can feel it when you go into a room ,
and ...
how many do you have ?
i want you to write again .
i 'm having dinner with my husband tonight .
it 's for you .
that means she moved him to a safe house .
bal@@ der 's program had a fre@@ ak encryption .
that means these guys are going after him next .
she doesn 't have the monopoly on guilt .
what makes you think i 'm not ?
yeah ?
he has a tat@@ too like yours .
no , worse .
that guy , he 's part of this group .
there were two key stories
i think you are scared
lis@@ beth . i haven 't heard of the spiders .
it 's the answer to " the snow comes early this year . "
father said he made his program based on how i think .
no , i don 't .
passenger need@@ ham , please proceed to gate 45 immediately .
north end of the terminal . person@@ n@@ el-@@ only door .
for now .
and make sure that he 's safe .
what i have is a responsibility to my country .
i understand how to open that door .
freeze ! wh@@ oa , wh@@ oa , wh@@ oa !
please get her a glass of water .
would you please talk some sense into him ?
i made these just for him .
it will not kill him ,
there 's a lot of pressure .
well , then you better find a sit@@ ter .
ye@@ p . i got a hot date .
right away .
no , it 's not a mi@@ gra@@ ine .
i have been off of
sir , you 're at seattle grace mercy west hospital .
