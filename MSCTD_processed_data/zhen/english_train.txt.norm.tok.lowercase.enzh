i want it sorted .

do you mean it ?
well , amy , looks like the elevator
uh , he 's working with bert .

it might be a head cold .
it do we ? do we really know them ?
they 're rule breakers , amy .

well , how can i help you ?
interesting question .
but , on the other hand , socrates says that
well , for me , it ends at 5 : 00 .
he 's going to have to remove it .
well , i don 't know if i 'd call you the good guys .
but i am pretty good at it .
okay .
what 's the story ?
i meant what 's the story medically ?
he is one of us and he 's hurt
the room key ?
i gave you the room key before we left the freakin ' room .

you did this last week
i 'm sorry . i 'm so sorry .
i lost the key to our room .
it 's been a very long day .

that 's good .
you 've met her .
you 're gonna need to explain stuart .
got us on a group health plan ,
thought it was funny .
she got him one of these ...
if he was gonna die , she wanted him to at least see it .
doesn 't look like he 's gonna get on a bike again .
pickup .
the lawyer sent over the divorce papers .
let 's just ...
i 'm done thinking about it , cristina .
we should never have gotten married in the first place .
and for the last two years , all we have done
that ends .
we don 't hurt each other anymore .
that is what a great night in the e.r. looks like .
let 's just get stupid drunk
i-i hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me .
you know what ? it 's probably fine .
penny ..
i 'm your son .
sure .
leonard , would it make you feel better to hear that
yeah . well , you should work on that .
yeah , the scientist .
i mean , he works with lasers and atomic magnets .
no , we did not set a date .
of course .
i 'm not .
actually , this is about where she and i are going to live .
well .. well , we might want to live together .
i 'm willing to let penny live with us
that 's very sweet .
i see .
well , yeah .
they just don 't appreciate you .
here , i made you some strawberry quik .
what happened ?
i also mentioned that he and i could live together
i 'm sure he 's fine . he probably just
so , what are you guys doing ?
anyway , as i was saying ,
right you are .
so , moe , tell us a little bit about yourself .
ah , yes , she 's married to my father .
does this count for points ?
it 's like that .
then why did she even go out with you ?
and , you know ,
okay , so the reason that might sound crazy ...
look , howard , you 're in a relationship .
yes , but my compromises are about which bedspread to buy
we both get our parents off our backs ,
i might never find another one who does .
i can 't believe your attitude .
yes , to other gay people !
oh , i don 't want a broken toy .
what ?
that was weird .
i cannot believe you guys aren 't gonna play with these .
relax . i 'm just looking at the box .
what is your problem ? !
which you probably did by shaking it !
leonard , i bought you this
you know , you 're right .
she comes home every day from school .
yes , brilliantly .
she has no friends .
then one day , she spotted a young fisherman
now at first , this angered jurate ,
until , one day ,
i heard you were gonna be in my class .
look . my name is patrick .
okay , nothing .
he wasn 't saying the impersonation to be mean or anything .
nothing , why don 't you read first ?
surviving your fascist shop teacher ,
thank you , sir .
don 't worry , mr. anderson . i 'm okay .
i would happily not take shop ...
i have 1384 days to go .
if my parents ask me about it ,
i just hope i make a friend soon .
charlie , come on .
it 's an endless nightmare .
so , do you like football ?
maybe you know my brother , then .
you guys seem really happy together .
he 's not my boyfriend . he 's my step-brother .
but she 's not bitter or anything . make no mistake .
you saw it . he 's never hit me before .
like aunt helen 's boyfriends ?
i can handle him .
please , don 't tell mom and dad .
holy shit . holy shit . they are ! they 're playing good music .
it 's not a sport , we all know it .
mary elizabeth , i think
bob , did you get him stoned ?
how do you feel , charlie ?
sam ,
okay , charlie . let me make the milkshake .
it 's like when you say
no . no , no , no .
so , he hated all that stuff .
where is michael tonight ?
i didn 't think anyone noticed me .
so , come on , everyone .
welcome to the island of misfit toys .
eight ? i have no idea .
i feel infinite .
for example , i am trying to participate
i completely agree .
amd istud wimg ex tra books outside of class .
my favorite time , though , is lunch
it 's called punk rocky .
when he was a junior
because brad had to get drunk every time they fooled around .
when they finally did it ,
and saying that he was going to hell .
i asked patrick if he felt sad
you 'll be surprised to know
well , all the great writers used to wear great suits .
of course i did .
i don 't know what to say .
no , that 's okay .
i 'm in such a great mood ,
you are .
when i met you ,
you 're like a sexy english school boy .
he was my .
you know charlie
and even if i do , i can just shut it off .
and maybe if it does get bad again
especially sam .
i 'm gonna ask her out at new years .
how long does this take to work ?
did your older friends pressure you ?
i would never do drugs . never .
then if anything grows while you pose
i could put in a good word for you .
yeah .
the one where the girl asks the guy .
i mean it 's like , " hey , thanks for the crumb . "
you wanna go with me ?
please come in .
a little closer together . that looks nice .
there you go . nice .
not really . how about you ?
it 's my first date , i don 't know what to compare it to .
i 'm sorry craig couldn 't come .
can 't say i blame him , really .
thanks , charlie .
like billie holiday and foreign films .
yeah . my dad collects wine , but he doesn 't drink .
i guess .
mary elizabeth ,
sam ! sam !
what the hell is wrong with you ?
no , charlie . trust me . you don 't want to go back there .
i didn 't mean to do anything .
other guys .
but it 's best if you stay away for a while .
how long do you think ?
i am starting to get bad again .
we 're going to be late for easter mass .
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven .
and forgive us our trespasses
mary elizabeth ,
i just get so messed up inside like i 'm not there or something
we 've all become such good friends ..
yeah . i mean i just don 't want to
stop embarrassing yourself .
are you gonna say something ?
you know why .
do you want your friends to know
where ? schenley park ?
i don 't know what kind of sick shit you 're trying to pull .
nothing .
say hi to your dad for me .
what did you just call me ?
hey , craig . sam will be down soon .
yeah , i 'll go put some pep in her step .
sure , patrick .
i 've been spending a lot of time with patrick .
he always says he feels free ,
then , sam got her letter from fpenn state .
patrick is going to the university of washington ,
it all feels very exciting .
especially because ever since i blacked out in the cafeteria ,
and i know it 's the last day ,
guys , guys , thank you for such a great year .
and i hope you have a great time this summer on your vacations .
charlie , very good .
last day .
so , i know it 's none of my business ,
well , my wife and i like it here .
you know , charlie , i was thinking that

sam and patrick left ,
she died getting my birthday present ,
she keeps driving away and dying over and over .
and i can 't stop her . i 'm crazy again
what ghar le cnan le !
uh , what if the wizard casts

stuart , settle an argument for us .
if i tell you that ,
mm ... make it two .
i 'll ring it up .
hey , can i talk to you about something ?
i know what this is about .
yes .
i 'm too small for twister .
and sitting with my feet on the floor .
hey , you know , my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me ,
guys , something happened .
i think a boy likes me .
" we met at the comic book store .
" it 's okay if you say no .
just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester .
doesn 't he know you have a boyfriend ?
so do you like stuart ?
he 's nice .
okay , look , sweetie , we all love sheldon ,
well , yeah , i guess they 're not engaged like me and howie .
lot of options out there .
out .
the deluxe limited edition " wild west and witches "
we just bought the regular pack .
yeah , it 's also a wand .
hey , do you see this ?
you got to be kidding me .
stuart , please . you 're being rude .
i believe i would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship .
with the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever ,
they 're gorgeous .
oh , look , the 's the future mrs. wolowitz .
with her head in the lap of .
yeah , and they can all move in with you and your mother .
i trusted you with my email address ,
don 't worry . they only stay on your record for a year .
come on , i touched one onion ring .
oh , honey , the buses don 't go where you live , do they ?
one of us , one of us .
you 're sitting in my spot .
leonard , she 's in my spot .
after you leave , i still have to live with him .
ooh , strike three .
what the hell kind of crap is that ?
party with the pretty girls , dude !
you 're not going to party with them .
that 's what they said to neil armstrong about the moon .
the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure
and a large number of people will believe it never happened .
and for our suddenly " back on the hindu wagon " rai ,
you forgot my barbecue bacon cheeseburger ,
you 're banished from the cheesecake factory .
well , you have three strikes .
and three : i don 't like your attitude .
not only is it a violation of california state law ,
i bet we could sell that sign all over pasadena .
well , here 's the thing .
really ? well , that 's great .
well ?
no , no , no , no , no . it is on .
oh , penny , you don 't want to get into it with sheldon .
apologize . never .
look , wait , sheldon , this has gotten out of hand , okay ?
how about we just call it even and move on with our lives ?
look , you 've got to meet me halfway here .
i 'm willing to concede that you 've done stupid things .
that 's how dad does it .
guys , you need to grow up , learn to be independent ,
i just ruined my shirt
oh , crap !
do you know why i pulled you over ?
no . you didn 't come to a complete stop
i 'm sorry . i guess i was just really distracted .
i 'm gonna be late for my dialysis appointment ,
and it explains why i look a lot more bloated than i do on my license .
confronting him will give you closure .
can 't i just confront him from the comfort of my own home ,
but i really wish you would .
why are you bringing evening wear ?
there 's gonna be a party .
you can 't make me go .
okay . i will .
that is my son .
i 'm not proud of what i did , but i didn 't want to lose you .
oh , keith .
he 's a wonderful little boy .
my whole childhood , my dad was in the army .
i always swore that i would never do that to my kid .
keith , you are not your father .
and you know what it really meant ?
i mean , it 's the only perk to come out of this whole thing .
i spend six hours a day , three times a week
i think i just saw two cockroaches throwing up .
didn 't they all die young of heart disease ?
sounds great , only make it a scoop of cottage cheese
i run the school you used to attend .
no , no , forget it . forget the whole thing .
i just keep waiting for an answer to appear ,
look , you have to understand ,
that 's healing for me .
it 's enough for me , carlos .
hello ?
absolutely . i 'm all set .
yes .
oh , my god . you still don 't believe me .
i couldn 't tell my mother or anyone in my family .
look , i know i have been hard on you guys ,
well , maybe you should have a party .
i can wait all day .
it is true . that hate was always a part of me ,
that was the drugs making you think that way .
how about a movie ?
he 's your son .
no . that was a bad idea .
that 's true .
face it . one of these relationships
that 's because you 're young .
please ...
hi there . we 'd like a table , please .
um , do you think that you could squeeze us in ?
oh . um , it 's just ... we 're so slammed .
let me see what i can do .
why is she getting a table before us ?
sir , she 's lost both of her kidneys .
well , i 'm a diabetic , and my wife has rheumatoid arthritis .
mint jay-leps are all the rage .
it 's just a fun thing .
yeah .
oh , i wouldn 't worry about it .
the guy 's a joke machine !
who ?
let 's get it moved !
very soon , my love .
the governor needs to pass .
how shall we picture the kingdom of god ?
he 's paralyzed .
did you hear that ?
i thought only god could do that .
he knows . it is blasphemy .
well , answer me
thomas , jesus has not come for the good ,
we should too .
blessed are the meek ,
fray to him , and he will listen .
ike this .
your kingdom come , your will be done ,
the law commands us to stone such a woman
to the first man who tells me
this cannot continue
he is leading us to something greater .
this is a dangerous man .
he has a big following in galilee .
galilee ?
nicodemus , don 't worry . nothing important ever came from galilee .
take the rope . lock it off .
it 's tesus !
they 've come a long way . they 're hungry .
but how ? we have nothing
thank you , father , for what you bring us .
how much more will he give to you ?
put god first , and everything else will follow .
you can lead us like an army . we 're strong enough to beat the romans .
messiah ! messiah !
it has been revealed to you by god .
tomorrow i will meet you on the other shore .
surely a messiah wouldn 't leave us like this .
so tell me what the way of the messiah is .
the son of god
malchus .
it 's another protest , high friest .
get the master back to his residence quick as you can .
the people are furious that the romans used the temple funds to build it .
on a donkey .
and riding on a donkey . "
e must not interfere with passover .
he 's going into the temple .
change your money here !
exchange here ! don 't like the look of this .
there will be no passover .
i will crush any rebellion .
what are you preparing , mary ?
just to talk
judas , you are his friend .
they say you can perform miracles ,
but you must be born again .
but i will always be with you .
that one of you here ..
father , take this from me .
lord , i know you are pleased with me ..
come on , mary .
keep him moving
you cannot go through with this . it is not legal
pilate will close the temple .
but what if he really is who they say he is ?
god demands we obey the law .
anyone who shows contempt for the judge or for the priest
brothers .
you know i would not have asked you ...
what has happened ? where is my son ?
arrested ?
they want to keep it secret .
are you the son of god ?
and you will see me coming ..
this is repulsive !
so ? execute him .
this is a tense time .
he claims to be our king .
well , babies do that .
it seems they couldn 't handle some constructive criticism .
actually . i 've been looking forward to staying with you .
because he 's her son ?
no knock ? what 's the fracas ?
ask any guy in high school .
check ' yes ' or ' no . "
really ?
well , you tell him i said , " who are you ? "
don 't worry , we 're cool .
i get it . you have high standards .
well , we 'll just have to come up with an excuse .
it 'll work . i 've used this to get out of eight jobs ,
she 's so sick , she can 't even stand up .
we have to go right to the emergency room .
it might be super gonorrhea . bye .
and on the night they were finally gonna do it .
and the coffee 's already working ,
give me that . let 's see if i can do math too .
16 times 12 .
you enjoy , i 'll preheat the oven .
there , that 's the coffee talking .
this is why they tell teen turtles
well , we 're mostly just sending pictures
and what 's this ?
he 's the one who broke up with me .
maybe you two are like chris brown and rihanna ,
i thought you guys were good together .
but then he kind of got fed up
he felt like he had to pull away for his own well-being .
but i 'm chris brown .
how 's that stove ?
'cause i needed help making 1,000 cupcakes in four hours .
one might .
and , andy ,
now , get the cupcakes out before they burn .
ah , there 's the girl i broke up with .
i 've had my hands in more boxes tonight
how come i never get a new dryer ?
that is not an f-word i have heard him use .
shouldn 't you be playing " words with friends "
of course he is . that 's not sad . what ?
it 's for soccer .
right .
say , listen , your dad and i were just talking
whatever you want because we love you very much .
what does " syzygy " even mean ?
hey , everybody , you remember my sister , pam .
okay , i heard that one .
oh , look who 's a cheater .
i have trouble smelling lemons .
but i 'll tell you what i can hear loud and clear .
oh , come on , dad ,
she 's the self-appointed sensitivity expert .
i will not let it go .
no sugar-coating .
claire , you have the floor .
okay , well , why don 't you give me an example
all right
okay . the singer or pepper 's dog ?
and when i was leaving ,
i 'm glad you had that experience ?
i love that song .
well , this was fun . who 's hungry ?
okay , anyone else ?
you 're the boy who cried " divine . "
you know , and half the people around here
okay ? and , yeah . about mine ?
are you showering like we discussed ?
uh-huh .
i 'm sorry for ruining your friday night .
i 'm telling you right now , i 've been to homebrew .
i 'm not one of those people .
steve , could you do me a favor , could you just please
you know if we 're gonna do this thing
that 's interesting .
you think that 's the first stop that we made ?
oh , well , then you already have a retailer .
look , paul . my middle name 's paul
i think we 're kindred spirits here .
and my gut tells me to give you this opportunity .
$ 400 for a hundred units , a third up front .
okay . i 'll pay $ 450 per machine . $ 450 .
but it 's a big payoff if you deliver .
all right . you got 90 days .
no , no . i 'm glad you asked .
maybe get you boys a fan when it gets hot .
what do you think ?
yes . it is . this is perfect .
oh , this is my friend daniel kottke .
kottke ? kottke from india ,
we 'll be launching the apple ll in about a month .
gentlemen , is there some place we can talk ?
look , steve . i 'm willing to take the risk .
but risk disguised as promise .
tells me you 're on to something big .
i think we should start with around 90 grand
i 'm sorry .
oh , whoa , whoa . wait . steve , one second .
oh , no , no .
i just don 't think it gets it done for you .
it 's social currency .
and if we want to stay there , we gotta risk everything
on the command bar ?
there 's over 20 different functions
we got to make the small things just unforgettable
you get a drop-down menu , and then there 's preferences ,
now , which tab do i click on to get different font styles ?
that 's actually something that i wanted to talk to you about , steve , is .
but everything we 're talking about is conceptual .
it 's not my job to be nice to people .
they don 't deserve it .
do you know how this company works ?
i 'd be happy to teach you , if you want to know .
why i left the safety of hp for this ?
i left because this was my thing
and of all the guys i knew , you were the coolest .
and this was my chance to do what i loved .
thai 's all , that 's all i ever wanted
no . no , you 're not .
on wall street the tech titan apple
it was the most over .
yeah . yeah . oh , terrific .
hey , pal .
business as usual , guys .
thank you . i had some fun ideas .
i 'm gonna get out of here .
hi . could you please tell mr. markkula we 're here . thank you .
gentlemen .
there 's something we need to talk about ,
he 's hemorrhaging the company 's dollar
mike , i love everything steve represents . you know that .
yeah . but , it 's his candy store .
mike , it 's a problem .
" congratulations on your first personal computer . "
then do something about it !
three years ago ibm had no interest in the personal computer
and i 'm sorry , but the board is unanimous .
for 18 months now you 've offered nothing but support
but you have to try to look at it
he 's great . yeah , he 's great .
they 're looking at losses in the millions
that 's right . the shareholders don 't see past their own shadows .
the way your employees see you .
it 's mine .
you 're letting them take it away from me .
now that doesn 't make any sense .
i 'd rather have a judge give me the works than have to do it myself .
so what ?
you can 't get away with it .
team ? i don 't .
well , obviously ease of use is a big feature here .
but , we 're kind of struggling with the interface , and , to be frank .
shit . yeah .
we 're gonna run the 68000 .
that 's correct . dude .
done
chris , it has been a .
you 're working on the macintosh ? yeah .
the macintosh is not even a toy . it 's a joke .
and so should we .
gentlemen , i believe it 's time to reconsider
what would you have me say , arthur ?
don 't put that on me .
you over-hyped the mac .
and as a result we lost two years of sales .
well , it sure as shit is somebody 's fault .
you 're stripping me of my resources ,
because it sells .
you guys must be pretty desperate .
how are things going with the newton ?
it 's not as bad as you think .
apple stock just set another record low .
i 'd say that 's pretty bad .
steve , what do you need ?
come on , i 'll show you around .
we 're not gonna ask for permission .
and while i commend his actions , and his initiatives ,
we need to 90 back to who we are , and what we do best ,
we 're gonna build a new line of computers
and we 're gonna kill every other project
we 're also gonna double down on the advertising budget .
just like back in the old days .
but i will not be able to move forward
apple is like a ship with a hole in the bottom ,
so why don 't you let me do my job ?
those in favor ?
who 's that woman ?
oh . is everything all right ?
i think we should check out hudson 's market .
we need cilantro , don 't we ? come on .
well , i wanted to get you a t-shirt that said ,
when i go home , and i 'm in tears and carlos asks me why ,
carlos gave $ 50,000 to one of your neighbors .
a mike delfino .
oh , my god . mike 's wife is one of my closest friends ,
there was just something so odd about that .. encounter .
mavbe that 's because i 'm not his friend .
my manager said i could take a break early .
i politely declined his offer .
not until a few months ago ,
well , it 's just , my cupboards are cluttered ,
thanks .
i want to show you something .
i mean , didn 't mike just have his truck repossessed ?
he got a big cash infusion .
he loves me .
so eddie attacked our son ?
he comes from an abusive home .
so i have to wonder if he 's gonna punch me
how about therapy ? that might help .
okay , here 's a thought .
we 'll try the therapy .
i guess my instincts about sam were right , wouldn 't you say ?
something . i wasn 't listening .
okay , i 'll stop . i know you 're upset .
when sam first showed up ,
but this has forced me to remember
i had to sit in a trailer and do my homework with mittens on
i 'm ....
do me a favor . don 't let on that you know how much it cost .
he thinks it 's ostentatious , and he 's a little embarrassed .
hey , guys . sorry i 'm late .
we 're gonna check on dinner .
oh , god , don 't worry about it . we didn 't buy it .
wow . without even blinking .
oh , carlos will do it .
i think carlos is having an affair .
because he 's been acting really secretive lately .
well , i 'm sure there 's a good explanation .
it 's just .. why are you calling over here all the time ?
susan , say something .
confess what ? !
you son of a bitch !
all i did was help a friend who screwed me over
that happened to you ?
they drew it so the testicles were my eyes .
so go apologize .
you started it , we just piled on .
zack , i 'm sorry you 're stupid .
come on . we 're trying to win a contest here .
penny , there 's no " i " in " justice league . "
kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends .
i changed my mind . i 'm not going .
it 's best you learn that now before you get the wrong idea . okay ?
we couldn 't save one donut ? not one donut ?
don 't you dare . don 't you fucking dare !
come on , man ! for the love of shit !
you know what ? last weekend , i grabbed kathy murch 's thigh .
okay , number one , i don 't even know what that means .
man , stop judging people .
i kind of do .
can i come with you ? we can take my dad 's kia .
shut up . milan pinache ? that 's huge .
yeah , you better jimmy up .
how ? i fired the dead weight and brought in cheap zombie labor .
out of the 25 boys seated here today
i 'm going to my room .
why do you think he left the room ? it 's because he doesn 't want to talk .
ned , listen , i know that at times it seems like it 's awkward between you and i .
you don 't mean that .
yeah . i do . i really do .
look , right now i need you down at the lot .
what about my dreams ?
uh , well , for starters , i want to be an engineer someday .
you gotta stop living in the clouds and get real .
i 'm sorry . you know , everything 's in order . so ...
we just wanted to talk about it .
okay . bye , dad .
i 'm about to get so high .
petra , is that you ?
i actually don 't need that magazine . that 's fine , thanks .

before it could send me to the right place .

we give the alien what they came for .
why would they pick dillford ? what 's the one thing our town 's known for ?
hey , hey . everybody !
mr. zimmerman , your daughter , she 's a vampire , right ? and you love her ?
mrs. franklin , your son is a zombie .
all the aliens want
only 30 reals .
good morning .
nothing , thank you . do you have a room free ?
very well .
won 't you have something meanwhile ?
and the txakoli is very good .
may i ask what brings you to our town ?
patxi ? the blacksmith ?
he 's an animal . and he 's dangerous . he 's so fierce they call him the hammer .
i just need to go in there to carry out a search .
i 'm sorry , that 's confidential .
i 've come ahead to start work on the investigation .
look , it 's bad enough that they raise our taxes .
but you 're always following after her .
mind your manners .
let us proceed to the eucharist . let us drink the blood of the lord .
there .
don 't be cheeky , matilde . behave like a young lady .
are you crying again ?
come ifow , i didn 't mean that .
what ? are you going to cry ?
shut up !
at times , there are horrible screams , too , that chill your blood .
others say that it 's the devil ,
no , it 's nothing . we were just saying how elegantly you 're dressed .
go in and search the place until you find something suspicious .
'd just be in the way . i 'm no good at field work .
there 's a chain .
okay , like we said . let 's go .
but i want you to know that i 'm always here for you .
suicide is a mortal sin . you know that .
but if that person wasn 't bad , is there no way to come back ?
but ?
i 'll take you to the vatican
yes ! you get me out of here ,
he took her to hell .
what ? now you want to go ?
the other demon took the little girl .
but that 's not my problem .
you owe it to her .
all right ! but you 'll go as my prisoner .
wait . you can 't go with a stupid hand bell .
the carlist gold !
santi , there 's the gold . this is our chance .
you look terrible .
no , no .... a difficult soul .
he doesn 't look so tough .

if i 'm facilitating escapes , we can 't have surprises .
don 't act like you 're suddenly a fan of the status quo , okay ?
that 's why you had to bust your brother out in the first place .
working on a new plan ?
just get tired of looking at empty skin .
but maybe it 's a way to get back to the states real fast .
you actually think i want to help you ?
$ 100k ?
difference is this time , you 're not alone .
what they call ' em again ?
not sure what 's in them .
yo , be happy you 're not eating snails .
do you think they noticed ?
guys .
i got a warehouse in new york . you 're coming to me ?
killing you might be a lot more satisfying .
we can be pretty sure he 's coming back to ithaca .
why would he come back here ..
of course .
he had a life before he worked for me ,
and when he went away , i ended up looking after them .
he wants to kill me .
i 'll be the bait if i have to .
he 's not just gonna stroll in here .
that 's why we got someone even more clever .
guy 's a pencil neck .
so you , in turn , can be the hammer .
he routed the image through a server
encrypted in the arabic , the images are all sorts of stuff .
visiting hours for zoos ,
he 's probably thinking if anyone sees this ,
this is making my head spin .
and that 's what i 'm doing .
because i 've got him so far off his game now ,
" but in return , you must take a life . "

stick it lily . stick it !
get off of my sweater !
are you really not gonna do anything ?
i know that tone . you 're making a point .
well , i guess i 'm just a naive boob
to see the sun dancing off the pacific .
i can 't stand the way everyone 's starting at us .

and i-i-i worry .
and i 'm gonna talk to her .
feel better .
no , no , her vertebral bodies are too large .
let 's move .
i mean , i don 't know what it means .

i 'm saying stop talking to me !
hey , are we ready ?

feng shui is good ' cause it 's important
i told you that before you married him . what a piece of shit !
i thought she was his ex-mistress , but .

that 's for you .
well , that 's why you take it beforehand , so you don 't get sick . it 's prophylactic .
if you could , do it today . no need to read it ... it 's just the usual stuff .
plus , i 'm traveling to miami and the bahamas .
i 'm sorry .
no , you were right about everything . and he 's still lying to me .
mark is flying down this week .
kate , i 'm sorry , but i can 't .

because if you did empty those accounts , you 're the one going down , not me .
think of it as payback . that 's how we framed it with nick .
i 'm tracking .
the only thing you 're gonna feel is my boot in your bum .
this place is gut boring .
and the only thing we 've seen all day is a pack of spotted hyena .

the memory of that moment was ruined the very next day .

i do want to forgive him , dr. goldfine .
really ?
they wrote a note .
they should come over and apologize in person .
you let those boys run wild .
it 's a disgrace .
it has nothing to do with my mother .
it 's a perversion .
what do you want me to say ?
i dreamed about things i wanted , and i got them all .
so this is just a blip on the radar for me .
and if i did it once , i can do it again .
even when it looks like i am .
yeah , i was cleaning my automatic
i know it sounds crazy , i just .
but i heard what you said at the restaurant .
we don 't have to talk about that right now .
i just want to be with you above everything else .
i may be stupid enough to shoot myself ,
yeah .
no . i 'll just wait out here .
you boys want some peanut brittle ?
don 't get any crumbs on my floor . move over .
i 'm sira . who are you ?
what are you doing here ?
i saw a man last night .
i don 't know .
why ever not ?
how do you know there 's only one wish ?
it 's a long way to go to find out .
it 's already been a long way .
oh , it 's just me .
they 're waiting back home with a big surprise party .
no , i told them they could have you tomorrow night .
gesundheit . you okay ?
come on , let 's go home
you know , i am very disappointed

how about darts ?
darts is a bar game .
hey , you 're harold jones , right ?
i loved your piece on the failure of derivative markets .
i look forward to seeing you around .
from me and all the readers .
why not ?
mailroom guys are meant to be seen and not heard .
we 're not on their level . we 're little people .
i am not ! dude , listen . i am just respectful of their workspace .
i 'll let you know as soon as i 've made a decision , nigel .
to explore bermuda and the smaller islands around it .
i 'm a. boat.man .
because i have to be honest , it was hard to find someone to do this .
that 's okay with you , right ?
it 's not a big story , but it 's a start .
everything i need to know is in here ?
and there 's a boat waiting for you .
that 's me !
that was close .
i don 't know about this , hank .
all this bermuda triangle talk is just to sell t-shirts to tourists .
mr. popularity .
i just realized why i felt like your writing came straight ..
sergeant peacock , what 's it doing ?
good .
hey , lemuel ! it 's darcy . i 've totally forgiven you .
great .
for you .
it 's like he had no feelings at all .
what 's with all the smiling ?
that grin .
i didn 't smile .
you did the same thing when you told him his hamster died .
yeah . he probably just needs time to process it .
yeah , honey .
we all manage it differently .
others ..
thank you .
hey , so since i 'm already here ,
yeah
what if i get a chaperone that my parents approve of ?
well , i guess so .
do you mind if he stays here for the party ?
i don 't suppose you 've thought of a chaperone ?
okay , you 're not hearing yourself .
hello ? hey , dad . it 's me .
i 'm sick .
yeah . yeah , 6 : 00 . we 're really looking forward to it .
i don 't know . let me ask .
um , uh , red .
okay . yeah , cam says red .
every time i try to do something nice ,
i 'm gonna chalk this up to jet lag
it 's my partner 's father .
did you know walt had a daughter
can you imagine ?
i told you , i would do everything possible
i wish he would 've said two things .
i bet you guys had some really good times
you know , luke ,
well , i mean , you guys liked to garden .
sweetie , how are you feeling ?
confused ? frustrated ?
before we get to dessert , i 've got some presents here .
love it !
look at this . oh . so elegant , huh ?
i think i might cry .
dad , i really gotta get home .
but you can 't expect me to see a sign that says ,
i just wanted a special day with my daughter ,
i 'm a week past my due date as it is .
just put the tv in the den . let 's get out of here .
it goes right here .
sometimes i 'd wake up in the middle of the night
yeah . that 's ...
is that any better ?
oh ! oh , my god . okay , no , no , no .
oh , hey , doc .
can i get you guys anything else ?
dad , why are you acting like this ?
i want to be eugene cernan .
" apollo 17 " astronaut ,
she was getting on board .
she has to be in day care .
that 's what you do . and then she cries .
mm . what she said .
thank god . it looks boring .
yeah , they 're closing the e.r. and streamlining the place .
you 're crazy . it 's not that bad .
look at this .
the end is coming .
with these new o.r. procedures ,
closing the e.r. should cut down on time .
how 's hunt feel about that ?
oh , it 's happening .
is he gonna leave town ?
when did it make this all about you .
derek has a plan .
he spent the night with kepner .
oh , they ' re gonna be mad about the ted conference .
do we have a reply yet ?
that was the subject line ?
well , would you open an email that said " proposed budget cuts " ?
no . we 're just gonna have to pitch it in person .
it 's hard to say no to someone 's face .
everything will be scanned ...
the last five hospitals whose efficiency she improved
well , i 'm safe because they can 't fire the pregnant lady .
uh , dr. nesbaum , you can take it from here .
good morning , everybody .
you sure the kid didn 't eat her ?
she 's angry . she 's 13 and she had a double hip replacement .
she 's mean .
she 's three days post-op now . okay ?
we just have to make her do it for her own good .
can 't even put a toddler in tights .
that 's how a bad cop does it .
yeah , and i told them to get lost .
the e.r. is open for one more day .
i know you don 't want it to ,
we are on a tight schedule with the renovation .
yeah , well , you 're gonna need to let that go .
i 'd just like to hear you name one thing
not everybody shares that passion .
okay , so you do the talking ,
hunt needs me in the o.r .
no . p-people don 't like me .
you can do this .
a technique i have developed through years
gross .
over the years , i 've developed my own technique
i 'm sure it 's lovely , but the point here
i suppose .
type and cross for six units .
hey , what 's your buddy 's name ?
does he have any allergies that you know of ?
i-i-i don 't know .
we 're doing everything we can .
on it .
oh , god .
okay , stop .
we could use blood .
very funny .
there are protocols in place for people who won 't
joy , get my headlamp ready .
wait a minute . wait a minute .
we 're trying to keep blood loss to a minimum .
so i hear somebody 's nose came off ?
almost . take a look .
and what should 've shaved off half a second
gauze , please .
all right , avery . that 's enough .
i mean , i feel like i 'm working the dinner shift
i mean , that 's essentially what she 's asking us to be .
you can tell dr. pantsuit hasn 't been in one in years .
well ...
so just give me a shout when you 're done .
doctors .
i thought i was gonna be fired .
oh , it 's fine .
my people just care about this place .
i know you 're all upset , especially you ,
so if you need to blame me instead of thank me ,
the muscles around your new hips will atrophy ,
because i 'm your doctor
if you went through all of that training
how badly you want something ,
feel that ?
yes !
okay , all right , people often ask me
oh , there 's redmond .
i saw your little howie today
ah , thanks . yeah , he 's a kick .
yeah , we 're not quite there yet .
oh , because the baby kicked .
jerk
maybe my baby 's kicking because it wants a granola bar .
you want to stop right there
he has eyes .
rich is circling the drain ,
yeah , i know . and they 're praying . awesome .
you think that because you 've been here all of ,
jeff .
save it . your sidekick already made the pitch .
oh , come on .
it 's not about the talks . it 's about the networking .
this is what 's good for the hospital .
the patients especially . mm .
your parking space .
uh , it 's not even an advantage .
i don 't want to swap . i want ' em both .
but this method will no longer be performed
because we 're cogs in an assembly line ,
and how good can that care be
with that kind of volume , who in the hell knows ?
you 're missing the point . the patients don 't matter .
mm . i didn 't ...
to just up and move at my age ..
in a few months , you won 't recognize this street .
what do you mean , it 's gonna change ?
all you need to know is that i 'm helping you .
don 't worry . it 's done .
oh , i promise you 're gonna have a great .. time .
as it happens , i need some good legal advice .
well , yeah . free is good .
you mean carmen .
half of carlos ' family scaled a fence at some point .
i am just saying .
you know ,
please don 't put it on the table .
well , the restaurant is pretty , uh ..
shall we ?
okay .
i thought you were pizza .
i don 't know . let 's see .
bree could see that i 'm a little down .
it 's not like i had anything special planned .
paul can 't open a halfway house on this street
he only gets one vote . no way he gets a majority .
does this seem too easy ? :
hey , what about the gay ?
okay . how about i just refresh everyone 's coffee ?
oh , can you be a love and bring back more of these cookies ?
bob ? roy ?
that 's ridiculous !
fine ! i 'll talk you up .
if we need someone to intimidate paul ,
why ?
you are such a brave little girl .
what are you talking about ?
the men who took daddy ?
mama !
no , mama ! i want to stay with you !
this is lovely , keith .
what is it ? oh , i know .
oh , i 'm sorry . i know we 've been having a lot of dinners
it 's really sweet the way you 've been looking after him .
me , too . mm .
wanna grab me a drink :
oh , yes , of course . would you like the ring delivered
i 'm too nervous to wait for dessert .
we have the jumbo shrimp cocktail .
isn 't that refreshing ?
i think we should cut all funding to the military
so shall we order ?
" shall we order ? "
i admit , she was much nicer when she was fat .
you think that 's what i was crying about ?
yes .
yeah . but we have to be very discreet ,
do we really have to talk about this ?
it was over 20 years ago .
the way he made me feel ..
he was the one ...
listen ...
i mean , mike and i had our share of setbacks .
i never stopped dreaming that maybe one day ...
they do not .
susan wishes mike had your sense of humor .
then why do you sound annoyed by that ?
i 'm the one who can 't wait to get away from her kids
for almost 20 years ,
you know , i 'm the one
and whose heart is so big ,
but now i know why you showed me your booms .
how does sleeping on the couch sound ?
thank you for taking care of mine .
hey , everybody quiet down . this shouldn 't take too long .
that is scheduled to open in the property
all those opposed to the halfway house ?
according to our bylaws ,
yeah , that 'll be 14 to 1 .
you might wanna check your math . i have at least seven votes .
with the acquisition of mr. scully 's place ,
i used the settlement i got from my wrongful incarceration
he was my realtor .
he just hired me . i didn 't know he was evil .
not that much .
you never told us about that .
well , none of this matters .
wow .
see you in show business !
good luck on bloodway , luna !
and i 'm cleo de nile , of the de niles .
you bet
i heard the ptolemys are hosting that gala tomorrow night .
woah !
woah-ho-ho ! boo york is so exciting !
it 's overwhelming . it 's giving me ideas !
i haven 't been able to write new songs .
if you can 't find it in boo york , it doesn 't exist !
do you know how to get to ptolemy tower ? we 're in a hurry .
at this time of day ? eek ! you 're crazy . scooch !
you know a lot about boo york .
my family helped build this crazy maze of a city .
and its power would make the couple 's promise permanent .
do you see all of this ?
it could be ours . it will be ours !
but daddy ! i don 't wanna be with that seth kid .
just think about all the power you will have
what if there were another way ?
cleo is an egyptian princess ,
yeah , you 're right .
then she can move on with her life .
if you love her , you 'll leave her .
the comet will crash into boo york city at midnight !
something about you looks different . no , don 't tell me ... hair cut ?
but hey , technically i am now a working actor in boo york city !
you 're hacking into satellite system to investigate ? very clever !
elle ? elle ! are you okay ? what 's happening ?
i 'm not sure .
comet does not seem to slow down ! ghoulia , what else can we do ?
look ! it 's pharaoh !
okay , everyone , let 's try to stay nice and orderly ...
hi ! i 'm catty noir .
come on !
you 're crazy !
come on ! you can get to anywhere you want in the city from up here .
oh , good , you 're here !
burnt sienna or terrifying haunted forest green ?
casta and the spells ?
where 're we going ?
i can 't remember the last time i got to
no , and my family can 't stand it .
all i hear is city noise .
i hear music !
cleo ! what are you doing ? why aren 't you dressed for the gala ?
you 've found your voice . why would you give that up ?
they offered me fame , money .
think about what i said . goodbye , pharaoh .
i 've waited for this moment forever !
very good . that 's the kind of music we want to hear this evening .
yes , mother .
of course , daddy . i 've got cleo exactly where i want her .
and tonight , she visits us once more .
a mysterious race of beings who live beyond the stars .
a message ? a peace offering ? a warning ?
and so we created the promise ceremony ,
but we have something to remind us
amazing !
on behalf of the ptolemy family ,
and to what i assume
you 're saying deuce just broke up with cleo for no reason ?
something doesn 't seem right ...
what about him ?
but if you haven 't heard , i won 't worry you about it
you 'd be rich . you 'd be powerful .
everybody wants me to do this ?
i mean , you 've already got deuce and .
whatever , forget i said anything ,
i know , it 's not " acting " acting ,
aw . thanks .
pharaoh , had feelings for each other
your attention ! your attention , please .
the promise ceremony will proceed as scheduled .
yes , mother .
get rid of this !
you 're right ! dude , thanks for the talk .
uh-huh . hey , kid , you gonna pay for that haunt dog or what ?
i saw nefera give something to toralei .
their voices must be somehow trapped inside .
no , she has the singing voices of two of the most talented singers ever !
the bright lights of bloodway .
you got it !
you bet she is .
not if she 's starring in my next bloodway hit , the book of gorgon .
back off ! she 's my new client !
can i get your autograph ?
and we found catty 's voice .
then we have to get back to the museum
pick a cab , any cab .
this is a clean house .
there 's no rush .
will you fetch the millers ' luggage ?
absolutely .
how long will it take ?
we do it in three stages .
you see , your immune system produces too many bad immunoglobulin ...
you really know your stuff .
rose and paul , you 'll be on this floor ,
unfortunately , our patients must be in their own rooms for treatment .
see you later , houdini .
you can 't wander this place by yourself .
where did she go ?
dear lord ...
and for this time that we get to spend together as a family .
in jesus ' name , amen .
something on your mind , honey ?
i said i was sorry , but he needs to put that drip back in his hand .
well , you should 've told someone . people thought you were dead .
well , that 's sort of what i wanted them to think .
good.yeah , okay . so give her some room .
yes , they are .
sure .
oh , i so did not need to know that .
down to the jailhouse to talk to mike .
yeah . but somebody 's gotta tell him about his new lawyer .
um , yeah , about that ...
he 's not crazy about me spending time with my ex .
i remember , and i guess that 's enough for him .
well , i , uh , can 't say that i blame him .
if you were home once in a while . you 're the one she listens to .
i know , l know . i know .
i don 't want you to be afraid to take a firm hand with kayla .
you know what that means .
i should treat her as badly as i treat my own children .
sorry . um ..
what 's to explain ?
do you know how many girls never get flowers ?
she locked me in here !
this is totally her fault .
well ... that 's a fresh approach .
it 's the truth .
okay , mrs . mccluskey 's downstairs , and we will be right across the street if you need us .
can you do that for me ?
but i 'm never gonna love her ..
so alma 's alive . big deal .
susan , please . we look stupid enough for suspecting him .
it may be a little late for that .
we have some questions about that jane doe we showed you in the morgue .
well , you were having an affair with her when she died .
susan ?
uh , i 'm happy to answer any questions that you might have .
enjoy the dessert .
you called the police ?
they needed to know that that dead woman was orson 's mistress .
and she was finding it delicious .
we sense their isolation ...
telling ourselves there 's nothing we can do to help ...
but this is spiritual blackmail !
i do what it takes to get the job done .
but we found this orphanage that had lots of older kids .
she 's 10 years old .
well , i talked to reverend sykes yesterday ,
you know , growing ud , i didn 't really have a lot of friends .
but i was never hated .
aw . so , sweetheart ,
well , we 're hoping to find a donor very soon .
i wonder who it 'll be .
i can 't believe this .
of course , she wants to .
morty and i are about to take a cruise ...
mommy 's mad because we played with her doll .
your doll ?
it 's ... a gift for bob and lee .
let me get your discharge papers ,
i will , uh , get your bag .
but if i was and i didn 't check ,
you know ...
and then i see
julie couldn 't wait to hand over one of her kidneys .
i wasn 't a match .
you only had a 15 % chance of being a match .
aren 't we lucky we already know those things ?
yes . i 'll be right down .
i 'll call you later .
yeah . i 'm not driving losers in my car .
here you go , ladies .
well , you have been through so much ,
cheese puff , anyone ?
married to paul young ?
hello .
you 're sure this is okay ? it isn 't gonna be awkward ?
why is it our responsibility to make her feel loved ?
but let 's talk about the last woman
we 're back .
oh . lovely .
we 'll pour you some vino .
well , i-i care what they think .
and i want them to accept me .
no , it 's not that . i just ..
right now
oh , fuck no
i don 't know . uh , you draw a card .
i know . i know . it 's stupid .
why , exactly ?
ah . yes . a totally normal room to have in a house .
okay .
i 'm sure mr. le bail is with us today .
not that he tells us anything these days . champagne ?
my foster parents were great people
i always sort of dreamed of having a ... a family .
i don 't doubt it .
finally have a real , permanent family .
it all began with a very generous benefactor .
you see , originally . great-grandfather was a merchant seaman .
on one of his many excursions abroad
after discovering a mutual passion for games of chance
that box .
mr. le bail proposed a wager .
well .
and since that time
our initiate then has the privilege of drawing the card ,
seriously , what the fuck is old maid ?
my dear , it is your turn .
it says , " hide and seek . "
hide and seek , right , dad ?
those are the rules .
well , it 's your initiation , my dear .
of course .
oh , fuck me .
how long does this usually take ?
of course it does not count . it must be the bride .
well , i don 't know . i 'm .. i 'm thinking .
oh , daniel , could you ?
she 's gonna die , guys .
so , what do we do with her ?
give me the fucking lanterns .
okay .
now ... i had to play along so that i can get you out .
you knew what would happen if i pulled that card .
and if you don 't , you die .
it happened to my great-uncle .
his wife too . same thing happened to my cousin rachel .
you have to play
you wanted to get married .
you 're everything to me
you just need to go straight down this hallway until you get to the service kitchen .
i 'm gonna unlock all the doors . i 'm gonna unlock all the doors .
no , it 's not over
so she 's dead . that 's just a side note
cock ! i forgot my gun .
maybe we 'll find the other one that 's still alive to clean that shit up .
does the help count
we must ...
we must kill the bride by dawn .
calm down . work the problem .
you have no respect for tradition .
don 't you think great-grandfather would ' ve used the security cameras if he had them ?
you pick and choose . pick and choose .
oh , no . that was dad 's idea .
take a minute .
we can 't let her get out . we 've got to guard the doors .
excuse me ?
i knew the girl would draw that card
none of us expected to be doing this tonight .
and , in case you didn 't notice , it wasn 't much of a choice for him .
go wait for stevens . he might need your help .
take the maids to the goat pit .
justin
yeah , you can go fuck yourself , justin !
i don 't know . maybe one night when i was chanting and slicing the throat of a goat
it felt normal .
if your family says it 's okay .
i 'm gonna do it right here .
hey . look at me . oh , my god . hey , hey look at me .
don 't go . don 't go , okay ?
i meant what i said this morning .
but i 'm not gonna let you hurt my family !
you don 't deserve a family .
afternoon , ray .
yeah , right here .
yeah .

they weren 't too happy to see me .
run those plates for me .

now we 're finished talking . you get out the hell out of here !
that 's your decision .

she sends sishop back in time ?
wow !
what might works ?
in the early 70s he was one of the world leading weapons designers .
using their gifts to fuel his own research .
she was like a sister to me .
but only succeeded in driving her away .
she found trask
wasn 't no last .
it only persuaded the government the need for his program .
tortured her and experimented on her .
and less than 50 years
if i can get to her
i can send someone back in couple of weeks .
it will rip you apart . i 'm sorry .
what if someone 's mind has a way of sniping back .
okay spread out .
so i wake up in the my younger body god knows where then what ?
i didn 't have my powers in 1973 .
i was a very difference man then .
patience isn 't my strongest suit .
was followed by the immediate extinction of the their less evolve kin .
we are the neanderthals .
you know when you send our soldiers to vie nam
and by the time you see the need for my program
we 're sorry dr.trask
just here to give my boys to proper send off
attention .
lab reports blood tests . all are getting packed up and send back .
same place as they are .
not just yet .
it 's only make the ride little smoother .
your men are not military .
this gonna be a little tricky because the person who sent me ..
what ?
50 years from now like in the future 50 years from now .
we 've been friends for years .
i know you thought you were going crazy when
i never told that anyone .
alright you 've picked my interest what do you want ?
i need your help .

i lost my fair share hah .
it doesn 't justify what you 've done .
i know that you took the things that mean most to me .
where were you your own people needed you ?
you and fhank pretending you were something you 're not
i never imagined they would use raven 's dna to do it .
the day i left to dallas .
strong
she was
she is out there fighting for our cause .
the girl i knew she was not capable of killing .
she couldn 't stay a little girl forever that 's why she left
but now we know where that choice leads , don 't we ?

sorry to hear about caesar . hope he pulls through .
a new team . retired the old ones .
what kind of guys you looking for ?
i 'm going after stonebanks .

these guys are pussies .
did 18 months for hacking into seattle 's central operating system .
why the hell would he do that ?
always on the damn road going someplace you don 't give a damn about .
yeah , i 've got two ex-wives and three kids who 've lost
i didn 't touch the auto-pilot .
all right , so what are we doing here ?
right there in the red dress , about to chop those guys in half .
i could do that .

took a dive for the money ?
what do you guys want from me ?
you wanna get yourself killed . with those youngsters ?

you 're seriously smoking next to aviation fuel ?
jing-a-ling , jing-a-ling

if you 're looking to go the family route ,
and when my life is on the line ,
is it ?
i 'll open your meat shirt and show you your own heart .
why don 't the two of us just end this ?
either you snapping my spine or me snapping yours .
he thinks i 'm joking . i 'm not joking .
you 'd be very impressed . then very dead .
come on , lay it out . i 'm a good listener .
carve me up around a fire ? very tribal .
and drop what 's left at the hague .
i finally made the big time .
now , being boss is more lucrative .
plus , you 've got that pesky moral conscience .
success , real success
oh , but you are .
shut your mouth !
go on ! it 's what he wants .
that it 's hard to beat an enemy when he 's living inside your own head .
now , when the time comes to kill you ,
jesus , we were brothers .
it 's a gps tracker ! it 's a gps cracker !
the best team member ever .
you wouldn 't believe what this guy was capable to do .
i like traveling

we 're the only ones crazy enough to get you out of it !
galgo , you might wanna get outta that seat . christmas is comin ' .
galgo , get the hell out !

come on , man . come on , come on .
yeah . he pay me more money .
i 'm the guy that just saved your ass .
hey , barney , leaving so soon ?
if you don 't want to meddle then why are you meddling ?
while arranged marriages are no longer the norm ,
you seemed confused .
we have to go .
what ?
up until then , arranged marriages were the norm , and it served society quite well .
i 'm not a big fan of musicals , but i love that show .
of course , it speaks to me culturally .
so what are you wearing ?
uh , so , anyhow , when would you like to meet ?
i 'll call you with a time and place .
ever since i was a little boy ,
i can barely look a woman in the eye !
i 'm not going to let my parents control my future any longer .
somebody give me a computer with a webcam !
okay , calm down .
why don 't you just meet this girl and see what happens ?
i cannot talk to women .
no , no , let 's see how long it takes him .
why don 't you bring her to my restaurant
wait a minute . what 's the plan here ?
what 's he going to do , stay drunk for the rest of his life ?
i can 't believe i 'm sitting here next to little lalita gupta .
well , i 've been trying .
mm , are you aware that dentists have an extremely high suicide rate ?
yay , me .
drinks do not work that way .
it 's about an indian princess who befriends a monkey
i know the reason .
sheldon , what are you getting at ?
you indian .
i can practically smell the lotus blossoms woven into your ebony hair .
i imagine you smell very nice too .
really ? so do i .
if you do not stop hitting on my lady ,
and i am not your lady .
you are my lady .
we are , for all intents and purposes , 100 % hooked up .
the only reason i came tonight was to get my parents off my case .
i won 't be able to look at him .
oh , now you 're a funny man .
dr.and mrs.koothrappali , in all fairness ,
he tripped him , jay . where 's the penalty ?
let 's take it down a notch .
jay 's from the city .
i come from a small village .
can you imagine one of ' em pregnant ? pregnant , no .
you saw that , right ? everybody fawning over lily ,
you are not giving the speech .
you 're right , you 're right . okay . i 'm sorry .
okay . excuse me .
this baby would have grown up in a crowded orphanage
yeah , i guess that works for me . oh !
oh , come on !
no , you 're not quitting .
she is not a girl . she 's a woman .
but i live up here !
manny , you 're with me on this , right ?
oh , for god sakes .
oh . it 's okay for you to take an older lover ?
i wanna go to the mall where she works .
okay . if that 's what you really want to do .
is that us , with wings ?
okay . well , that 's reassuring , right , lily ?
your fathers are floating fairies .
by the way , we need to stop having friends
yeah , i 'm a senior .
hey , phil . sweetie . honey . he is dylan , and he is a senior .
let me meet this " playa . "
oh , god . if cam comes out here with boobs , i 'm leaving .
i hope he didn 't embarrass you , mom .
and phil shot him .
what do you mean , " bad idea " ?
i mean if you two guys are bored , get a dog .
i support you , mitchell , even though you 're not my son .
is that , mitchell , you 're a little uptight .
that 's what you 're saying .
okay , people . let 's all " chillax . "
someone who 's not insulting me notices he 's not here .
you two broke up .
let me introduce myself . i am white boy bobby !
bob ! bobby !
bob ...
attention , all units . there 's been a shootout
most of the armed men are still in the apartment .
now do it again .
here it comes , here it comes .
okay .
i just need you to push really , really hard .
really big push for me .
push . push , carol !
why is there no sound ?
take her out . take her out !
you did such a good job .
charlotte put her career on hold , and went back home care for her mother .
i was thrilled that charlotte reached out to paloma and myself ,
i better catch up .
was it something he ate ?
what 's happening down south ?
passed in the air . real contagion-like stuff .
oh , it can 't be that .
i am out of practice on the binge drinking .
do you want some ibuprofen ?
my head is throbbing .
the pharmacy is open for business .
it 's the best cure .
you really don 't speak any mandarin ?
lizzie , you have to stop it .
they 're fucking inside of you !
help me ! help me , charlotte !
good morning .
i 've come too far for anything else .
loki ,
an ant has no quarrel with a boot .
i come with glad tidings
freedom .
once you accept that , in your heart ,
sir , director fury is stalling .
he means to bury us .
a lot of men still under .
sound a general call .
roger that .
as of right now ,
this is not how i wanted this evening to go .
believe me
well .
it 's for her .
we have an f-22 exactly eight miles out .
we need you to come in .
this takes precedence .
this moron is giving me everything .
look , you can 't pull me out of this right now .
barton 's been compromised .
where is barton now ?
sir , i 'm afraid he 's insisting .
levels are holding steady , i think .
which brings me to my next question .
well , i really wouldn 't know , now would i ?
no , all this came from that .
stark tower is your baby .
my private elevator ...
.... it was teeming with sweaty workmen .
it 's not going to be that subtle .
the next building is gonna say " potts " on the tower .
call your mom . can you bunk over ?
i 'm afraid my protocols are being overridden .
you have reached the life model decoy of tony stark .
is not this simpler ?
it 's the unspoken truth of humanity ,
you were made to be ruled .
not to men like you .
there are always men like you .
let him be an example .
the soldier .
i 'm not the one who 's out of time .
fury didn 't tell me he was calling you in .
where 's this coming from ?
i 'm not overly fond of what follows .
and now there 's that guy .
that guy 's a friend ?
if he frees loki or kills him , the tesseract 's lost .
i have a plan . attack .
i don 't see how i can .
there 's only one god , ma 'am .
you come home .
you need the cube to bring me home .
you listen well , brother .
do not touch me again .
you have no idea what you 're dealing with .
doth mother know you wear-eth her drapes ?
loki will face asgardian justice .
a warm light for all mankind to share .
well , let me know if " real power " wants a magazine or something .
loki 's gonna drag this out .
he means to lead them against your people .
an army
that 's what he needs erik selvig for .
i want to know why loki let us take him .
i don 't think we should be focusing on loki .
you could smell crazy on him .
loki is beyond reason , but he is of asgard .
he killed 80 people in two days .
i think it 's about the mechanics .
it 's a stabilising agent .
i 'll fly you to portland .
it means the portal won 't collapse on itself
also , it means the portal can open as wide
he thought we wouldn 't notice , but we did .
he turns .
the rest of the raw materials ,
something to kick-start the cube .
last night .
am i the only one who did the reading ?
mellow jazz , bongo drums , huge bag of weed ?
funny things are .
no offence , doc .
and they trample everything in their path .
and now , again .
war hasn 't started yet .
i do not know . loki 's mind is far afield .
there 's no pain would prise his need from him .
what are you asking me to do ?
loki is a prisoner .
there 's not many people who can sneak up on me .
after .
pathetic !
you pretend to be separate , to have your own code ,
and they will never go away .
slowly , intimately ,
rogers , we gathered everything related to the tesseract .
i 'm sorry , nick .
i was wrong , director .
did you know about this ?
i was in calcutta . i was pretty well removed .
and you 've been doing what , exactly ?
yes , and i 'm not leaving
i got to get this superconducting coolant system
what does it look like in there ?
well , you 're not wrong .
try to think !
what 's our next move ?
i 'm going to have to get in there and push .
that stator control unit can reverse the polarity
you see that red lever ?
stand by it . wait for my word .
plan b .
then skip the spinning rims . we 're on the clock .
actually , i 'm planning to threaten you .
yeah .
would you like a drink ?
doctor
it 's not your fault .
actually , i think i did .
loki 's sceptre .
and i 'm looking right at it .
jarvis , you ever hear the tale of jonah ?
director fury is no longer in command .
i 'm fine .
yet he cried when they changed the raisin bran box .
after an owl eats , he spits up part of his meal ,
you don 't see too many spherical cakes .
i have a confession to make .
really ?
i had a pet pig when i was a kid .
yeah , we won 't be eating arthur tonight .
too bad . i thought it was florida .
so , um ..
always ..
i thought there 'd be more of a reason why you 're here .
i suppose it has something to do with your recent passing .
oh , no . no .
yeah , i 've-i 've outlived a few of my doctors , too .
yes . you need me .
you do realize this is yemen , don 't you ?
mud huts . there is no map .
you want to trust this guy ?
and i will kill you .
don 't think one bullet is going to get us out of this .
the man who would kill himself before being captured by isil .
hold on .
you bring omar car , but not omar ?
because of the war ?
he told us to bring this stuff for you .
back in the city ...
we will both die out here , american !
he sent this image from yemen . why ?
blue hawaii in portland , maine .
thank you ! thank you , guys .
she fell in love with me !
is that wrong ?
you must really need that potion .
what ?
so , the one thing more powerful than the potion is .. real love ?
that took forever !
you shut me away , and you shut me up !
teaching moment . there are no shortcuts to love .
stuff , take it away .

all right . have a good one , buddy .

we 've been awfully busy lately .
i 'm not sure . do you have any experience ?
yes , i have experience .

beautiful . thank you .
where do you want to go ?
give me a hug . all right .
you , too .
you might not want the company , but i 'm headed home .
it 's a habit i 'm trying to break .
i started in middle school and .... what you got there ?
i think it 's the store owner 's daughter .
yeah , that 's what she said
i always dreamed of going overseas to europe
i had this extra can of primer in the back .
yeah , right . i didn 't even think about that .
katie ... katie .
that means stuff you don 't want , stuff you don 't even need .
no , because when you put it ...
i just don 't want to owe him anything .
ok , right .
i mean , the guy has three little kids and , you know ,
look , no one 's innocent .
t don 't care if he killed her himself
the job is to bring him in , the other guys sort him out .
every year the crowds get bigger
i am not freaking out .

well , what are some of the things they like ?
then my dad said based on their love life .
he said that to her ?
oh , maybe i could make a gift for them .
hey . what 're you working on ?
yeah ... ?
great timing .
leonard , what if you have an allergic reaction
well , then why don 't you wear the rubber gloves
fine . what about epilepsy ?
you don 't , but the surgeon might , hmm ?
sheldon , do you realize that driving is riskier than surgery ?
that is if you make it to the car
although now that i think about it ,
no , but last year , at magic mountain ,
look , there 's an entire section of my dashboard
i 'm odd all the time , everyone knows that .
probably about the same way she treated me .
having $ 10,000 , so she can go to that amazon school
exactly .
we 're really doing her a favour .
what are you doing here ?
you built this city all by yourself " ?
sure did .
i heard that at the wedding .
she 's not seeing anybody yet ?
truth be told , i think she 's still a ... you know .
a virgin ?
and at least just set up a meet and talk to the guy .
she died before they could put the fire out .
they say she 's the one in the family i look the most like .
i don 't think she ever got married , though .
it 's for you .
i was wondering if you could meet us at bob 's muffler .
there 's a pool hall next door , out of business .

jenny , i gotta call you after my shift .
yeah , me , too .

nothing in particular . what do you do ?
i mean , if you 'd like to visit me some time , you 're welcome to .

what a strange girl you are .
flung out of space .
maybe i should stop home and change .
you married a woman like me .
then what ? then it 's over ?
where 's the tape , you son of a bitch .
whatever you want .
but the tape is already on its way to your husband .
my reputation rests on my efficiency , mrs. aird .
you don 't . ma 'am
let 's get out of here .
oh abby , i don 't know how to fix this ...
what are you thinking ? you know how many times a day i ask you that ?
i should have said no to you .

i don 't know what i want .
i took what you gave willingly .
thank you , darling .

i think you 're paranoid . i 'm not paranoid .
it was probably on the way to the mac store and fell off the truck .
i didn 't realize that that 's such a big deal .
yeah , i don 't think the science is there yet .

you want to prove that you 're not like him ?
he 's been waiting for you all day .

let 's go .
i was wrong . i need to figure this out .
one shot , ethan .
we 've got to take control , little brother .
i 'm not going to let you get yourself killed .

i feel cool .
sheldon , when i said i was fine ,
because that 's not what people do .
no . no , you don 't , you really don 't .
well , it certainly would be easier .
what do you think ?
it could help me be a more considerate friend .
it could also help me identify my enemies ,
i like the first one .
i was thinking maybe a library or a gaming room .
i don 't like trains . you like trains .
sheldon , i just heard from the guys at mit
although i 'm not sure how i feel
maybe i could use it
what is wrong with you ?
why would you do that , raj ?
you 're not gonna get information ,
he really worked with the drug enforcement agency ?
hey , leonard , if you 're happy and you know it ,
surprisingly well .

you 're kind of a sad sack .
i 'm just upset .
i mean , you 're the one who doesn 't want my brother to come , so ..
oh , i 'm gonna throw you so hard ,
that 's because we are .
i don 't need an emotion machine !

i need you on pre-ops and post-ops .
yang , you 're with me today .
today ?
congratulations .

he was post-op , he was fine
but , uh , he 'd been getting short of breath ,
that it wasn 't a pe. he was bleeding internally .
god , i will never forget the look on his wife 's face ..
how do you live with it ?
karev , take a hold right at the temple
tenderness around the incision is normal .
uh . megan , will you please go to 20 .
thanks .
uh . i know it seems personal ,
but are they supposed to look like that ?
they 're supposed to be doctors ?
what the heck do we do with them ?
i guess we should just talk to them .
besides , we 'll just waste time .
but my friends are coming after the surgery .
we met in an online chat room for orchid lovers ,
this device is gonna help prevent lung problems
sit up straight .
hole

they 're coming now .
hi , it 's me shayna .

you blew it off ?
i called every favor i had in this hospital
why didn 't you go ?
oh , why don 't you ? i 'm working really hard on this .
i know how violent surgery can be .
they 're gonna slice open my abdomen
derek shepherd is in the freakin woods right now
why did you tell me , then ?
just keep your mouth shut
it took us three years to find the right candidate ,
the ethics board will not allow me
you see that orchid ?
i 'm not accepting it , because i 'm older than you ,
and i know you 're gonna need at least one friend
i 'll be here when you do .
what am i gonna say
she took me back .
from anything .
you turn on each other now ,
pierce get an ice pack
and , megan , you should go to o.b .
that was very bailey .
wait . i 'm sorry .
now i haven 't asked for much .
i want to go on a tour of russia with my friends next year .
said that was why i was off the program ,
he 'll never bully you again .
no . no , you are nothing like him , ender .
i thought you had a game .
we must conquer or die .
why ? you 'd rather not know what 's going on in the world ?
speak your name .
don 't freeze your balls , kid .
at ease
ask me a legitimate question
when the enemy first invaded , we were not ready .
we threw everything we had at the invaders .
sergeant , explain the game .
you will train to compete as a team against other teams .
but , if either side gets one cadet
sir , yes , sir !
" and no one ever adequately explains
" everyone here is very different .
" always very little sleep .
" are you getting my e-mails ? i miss you "
i 'm pleased to see that most of you are performing well .
some in the higher ranks have failed to meet our standards
look to your left .
these are not your friends .
keep up the hard work .
drop and give me 20 !
no , sir .
yes , you will , sergeant .
get up !
a useless , skinny , untrained snot !
let me be clear .
my army is undefeated in the last 21 battles .
what are you doing here ? bonzo will kill you .
well , then get in the game . we 're losing .
put your feet to mine . redirect me .
don 't draw your weapon till you know you have a shot .
in three , two , one ...
where 'd you learn all this ?
come on . let 's go again .
keep ' em to yourself .
how did his psycho brother end up in the game ?
of course he 's feeling pressure , anderson !
the game is a thought relationship
then change the story !
i can 't change that !
erase the game .
top test scores in class .
but you have a habit of upsetting your commander .
puts you in a difficult position , doesn 't it ?
you don 't like taking orders from bonzo .
no , coward .
come out and fight ! come on !
i could break your arm !
we 're gonna send him home . back to earth .
i want to go with him .
you 've come so far
i make it impossible for them to ever hurt me again .
i told them i won 't cooperate .
i think you 're hiding because you 're afraid .
afraid you might lose .
you can 't hide here forever .
i 'll miss you .
i need to know that you will not block my e-mails again .
initiating final approach .
this was a forward staging post
if they 're on their home planet ,
the purpose of this war is to prevent all future wars .
yes , sir .
ic 's breathable , but thin
who are you ?
you wanna fight me ? is that the test ?
i 'll just sit this one out .
since when do you tell the enemy when he has won ?
why didn 't you destroy me immediately after ?
there is no teacher but the enemy .
once our battle fleet is detected
crust we have chosen our commander wel
absolutely .
we 'll be with you soon .
" dear valentine . . so this is command school .
" that i might not measure up .
" and i promise you
harvesting water .
too risky . let 's not reveal our best weapon
" the pressure to win , day after day ,
great work , bean !
ender , watch our right flank !
i see it ! bernard , you flank them !
alai , peel right !
war isn 't a game where you get to reboot and start over !
nobody 's saying not to take risks .
you focus on the big picture .
sleep deprivation is part of your training !
tf i 'd been smarter ,

i could 've got you a great discounted room rate , say , 11 years ago .
ahead of time what i 'm getting into ?
i just wind up tossing them anyway .
mr. parmitt ? daniel ?
that is so kind , but i 'm afraid i have other plans .
okay .
all right , let 's get it while it 's hot .
we have to lay low .
i don 't understand what the big deal is to go out and get two pizzas .
i 'm getting cheese .
oh , my god !
yeah , dogs like me .
do i need to get you towels ? oh , my god .
do you wash it ? do you not wash it ?
do we put pressure on it ? what do we do ?
leslie , listen to me !
a pay phone , and call this number .
might not be an answer but maybe .
in a word , triumphant .
oh , yes , you should have seen those young people .
i may have changed a few lives today .
i don 't know , i kind of promised howard .
actually , we should all share the moment .
oh , tweets about my lecture .
that 's downright cruel .
yeah , i 'm not familiar with the acronym " kmn " "
i know the feeling .
it-it happened to a friend of mine .
leonard and i are fine ,
he 's such a cutie .
hi . can i help you ?
yogurt ?
you do ?
all right .
it says " camarillo state mental hospital . "
it 's the only explanation i can come up with
let 's just try a different improv . uh ..
you bet .
i was gonna be famous .
you have any frozen yogurt ?
i took the liberty
why don 't we leave that for future generations to decide ?
it 's the story of a young boy who is transported
she 's probably hungry .
come here , baby . come here , little baby .
chupo .
see ? we 'll figure it out .
it 's been a month , abena . you ready to go home ?
that 's just crazy , right ?
i 'm in the middle of my contract ,
cancer ? he might have cancer ?
he died .
i 'm sorry . i-i said " rule out cancer . "
okay . so that 's , uh ... update the patient .
you are organized .
okay . well , mr. aranda here needs to
oh , actually , no .
um , how did her baby get tangled up in her intestines ?
the baby survived a full term outside of the uterus ?
her tubes are scarred , so the fertilized egg
well , why didn 't it show up on the ultrasound ?
but she still sees me as a patient ,
hey , um , what 's this ?
hey . hunt . uh , my knee replacement got canceled ,
well , it 's my first day back , and i left my baby
it doesn 't have to be big .
okay .
they all sound like her .
what ? what are you doing here ?
no , it 's not .
well , how about you , karev ?
you .
the job at namboze clinic has never been filled .
there 's a med school loan forgiveness grant attached to it .
i mean , they know you . you 're kind of perfect .
you 'd be great . i could take care of it with one call .
sir .
and it will kill you .
we saw it today . you 're not built for this job .
so just ... just be a surgeon .
are you done ?
thank you for your time .
but what 's wrong with the furniture we have ?
and there was no place for company .
according to the roommate agreement ,
i put you there after you forwarded me
okay , what does all this have to do with the elevator ?
it 's one against one .
but i said no to that .
and i settle all ties .
why ?
so , i get the draft ?
fine .
a sickness had begun to grow within him .
and where sickness thrives .
the first they heard was a noise like a hurricane coming down from the north .
and that means good food , a warm hearth ..
thank you .
that is private . keep your sticky paws off .
not ready for what ?
what on earth are these ?
ah . good gracious . is it today ?
do you think he 'll come ?
gandalf .
he 'll give us quite a show , you 'll see .
beg your pardon ?
i 'm sorry , do i know you ?
i 'm gandalf .
old took used to have them on midsummer 's eve . heh , heh . ahem .
and where else should i be ?
well , i 'm pleased to find you remember something about me ..
yes . well , that 's decided .
and most amusing for me .
inform the who ? what ? no . no . no .. wait .
i suggest you try over the hill or across the water .
it 's nice , this place .
did you do it yourself ?
that 's my mother 's glory box . can you please not do that ?
mr. dwalin . ha , ha .
" everyone " ? how many more are there ?
there 's far too many dwarves in my dining room as it is .
... i can only say it is in very poor taste .
gandalf .
not the jam , please . excuse me . excuse me .
" cheese knife " ? he eats it by the block . ugh .
i cannot hear what you 're saying . it 's an antique . not for sitting on .
excuse me , mr. gandalf ?
may i tempt you with a cup of chamomile ?
whoop ! mind out .
uh , fili , kili . uh ...
he is late , is all . he traveled north to a meeting of our kin . he will come .
it 's got a fruity bouquet .
bombur 's on his second leg of lamb already .
wanna bet ?
i 'll help you with that .
what 's the matter ? i 'm surrounded by dwarves .
oh , they 're quite a merry gathering once you get used to them .
look at the state of my kitchen . there 's mud trod into the carpet .
airborne fire-breather .
extremely fond of precious metals .
i 'm not afraid . i 'm up for it .
sit down .
.. but we number just 13 .
gandalf will have killed hundreds of dragons in his time .
how many , then ?
well , how many dragons have you killed ?
excuse me . please .
the dragon , smaug , has not been seen for 60 years .
... wondering , weighing the risk .
do we sit back while others claim what is rightfully ours ?
there is no way into the mountain .
how came you by this ?
by train . for safekeeping .
if there is a key ..
these runes speak of a hidden passage to the lower halls .
well , if we can find it , but dwarf doors are invisible when closed .
and i do not have the skill to find it .
the task i have in mind will require a great deal of stealth ...
i cannot guarantee his safety .
nor will i be responsible for his fate .
one-fourteenth of total profit , if any . "
but not limited to lacerations .
.. than to find out what was beyond the borders of the shire .
it 's out there .
i am a baggins of bag-end .
yes .
in the battle of green fields , he charged the goblin ranks .
there are a few warriors amongst us .
i would take each and every one of these dwarves ..
for when i called upon them , they answered .
a willing heart .
you don 't have to do this .
you 've done honorably by our people .
a life of peace and plenty .
far over the misty mountains cold
can 't stop , i 'm already late !
i 'm going on an adventure !
that 's true enough .
wait !
everything appears to be in order .
to the company of thorin oakenshield .
no , no , that won 't be necessary .
i 've done my fair share of walking holidays , you know ?
orcs ?
the lone-lands are crawling with them .
quick and quiet , no screams . just lots of blood .
you think a night raid by orcs is a joke ?
no , you didn 't .
here , mr. gandalf , can 't you do something about this deluge ?
and it will continue to rain until the rain is done .
are there any ? what ?
the greatest of our order is saruman the white .
do you know , i 've quite forgotten their names .
i think it would be wiser to move on .
i have told you already ...
why not ? the elves could help us .
i do not need their advice .
help ?
what help came from the elves ?
everything tastes like chicken .
what tastes like fish !
oh . " thank you very much , bert . lovely stew , bert . "
ooh . that is beautifully balanced , that is .
good , isn 't it ?
i was looking for you , gandalf .
something 's terribly wrong .
just give me a minute .
it was right there on the tip of my tongue .
it 's a silly old ...
to seek refuge with our enemy .
the only ill will to be found in this valley is that which you bring yourself .
they will try to stop us .
if we are to be successful , this will need to be handled with tact .
and no small degree of charm .
stay sharp .
my lord elrond is not here .
where is he ?
gandalf . lord elrond
that may have been us .
i do not believe we have met .
i knew thror when he ruled under the mountain .
what is he saying ?
try it . just a mouthful .
where 's the meat ?
kind of you to invite us .
well , you never are .
i 'm not actually sure it is a sword .
how did you come by these ?
and what were you doing on the great east road ?
for goodness sake , thorin , show him the map .
it is mine to protect , as are its secrets .
your pride will be your downfall .
who can read that map . show it to lord elrond .
it 's mainly academic .
you still read ancient dwarvish , do you not ?
of course .
well , in this case , that is true .
.. of the same shape and season as the day on which they were written .
these runes were written on a midsummer 's eve .
.. a dragon could be used to terrible effect .
gandalf , the enemy is defeated .
gandalf , for 400 years we have lived in peace ...
trolls have come down from the mountains .
orcs have attacked us on the road
.. looking for trouble where none exists .
well , he 's odd , i grant you . he lives a solitary life .
they 've addled his brain and yellowed his teeth .
caves in the mountain are seldom unoccupied .
right , then . let 's get a fire started .
get some sleep .
we were to wait in the mountains until gandalf joined us .
plans change .
back to rivendell .
you 're part of the company . you 're one of us .
thorin said i should never have come and he was right .
well , well , well .
thorin , son of thrain , son of thror ..
oh , but i 'm forgetting . you don 't have a mountain .
.. which makes you nobody , really .
just a head .
perhaps you know of whom i speak .
now , now , keep your distance !
i don 't want any trouble , do you understand ?
why ? is it lost ?
that 'll do it .
you 've got to be joking !
there 's too many . we can 't fight them .
come on ! here ! on your feet .
my precious . wait !
it 's weird again .
and what you said is true .
so i had no right to do what i did .
i hope you can forgive me .
a couple years , but i just put a few bucks aside
my god , leonard , do you know
what good is it if you don 't use it ?
i have money i love ,
sid . acute lymphoblastic leukemia .
i 'm patrick . testicular .
basically , they found it in his nuts ...
we 're here for you , hazel .
christ is our friend and he 'll be there till the end
you can let go , sweetie .
that should have been the end .
but then something strange happened . the antibiotics kicked in
it didn 't work in over 70 % of the patients ..
so , they called it " the miracle . "
so , are you back in school ?
whoa ! a college girl !
oh ! careful !
okay , what 's it about ?
it 's about cancer ?
he 's the only person i 've ever come across in my life .
but , b , hasn 't actually died .
i will read this horrible book with this very boring title .
i know that these are not important literary questions ...
" and , of course , if you ever do decide to write anything else ..
" frankly , i 'd read your grocery lists .
you think ?
is it really 1 : 00 am ?
yeah , i guess it is .
okay .
oh , my god .
you did mot use , your last dying wish ..
to e0 to disney world .
it was actually a really fun trip !
okay , i 'm not seeking political asylum . it 's a few days . it 's a vacation !
what if you get sick
i mean , it 's really just the sky . the sky is making me sad .
that my dad built for me when i was a kid and .
well , i demand to see this swing set of tears .
this is one sad swing set .
me in no way lessens my affection for you .
but everything . an oncologist is set there .
i love you .
okay , hazell grace ?
what 's in your nose ? jackie !
it 's called a " cannula . " and it helps me breathe .
the young fans with whom you 've been corresponding
please , come in .
to never have to encounter americans .
the tortoise has a ten-yard head start .
the tortoise has moved maybe one yard , and so on , forever .
you can only decrease his lead .
as long as you don 't contemplate the mechanics involved .
that no one really solved it ..
hazel , i 'm sorry . i have no idea what 's going on .
has the cancer found its way into your brain ?
please ?
because she dies , or that she becomes too sick to continue ...
i said i 'm not interested .
nothing happens ! they 're fiction !
but they can 't !
i do not want your pity !
like all sick kids , your existence depends on it .
peter !
a child who believes there is a life after a novel ends .
so , we pay for your treatments , your oxygen machines .
you are a side-effect to an evolutionary process ..
you are a failed experiment in mutation .
be better than any piece of shit that dirunk guy could write .
you 'll love it .
no , you did not spend it on him . you spent it on us .
i 'm very sorry .
i thought meeting you would help him ...
but .. i 'm very sorry .
you see , we may not look like much ..
and two-and-a-half working pairs of lungs .
so if i were you , i would go back inside .
i mean , i was supposed to be special .
yeah , i know . but
you know this obsession you have with being remembered ?
i am mad .
you think that the only way to lead a meaningful life ..
i 'm sorry . you 're right .
hey .
it 's not over yet , you know .
when the pain is , just for a minute , bearable .
that your last good day is your last good day .
hello , augustus .
i decided to plan this pre-funeral .
augustus waters was a cocky son of a bitch .
not because of his superhuman good looks ..
18 years , buddy .
i 'm assuming you have a little more time , you interrupting bastard .
but when the scientists from the future ...
i 'm gonna tell those scientists to piss off , because ..
i don 't .
then , having made my point , i 'll probably put the robot eyes on ...
and i don 't know ... um ..
godspeed .
hazel , can i get a hand here ?
yeah , and turn around . sit down . there you go .
my name is hazel grace lancaster ..
ours was an epic love story ...
like all real love stories
i 'm not gonna talk about our love story , because i can 't .
i am not a mathematician , but i do know this .
there 's point-one , point-one-two , and point-one-one-two , and ...
of course , there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between zero and two ..
for our little infinity .
you gave me a forever ..
and for that , i am ..
i love you so much .
augustus waters died eight days later in the icu .
stopped his heart , which was also made of him
every second , worse than the last .
is to rate your pain on a scale from one to ten .
and i remember once ..
though i couldn 't speak , i held up nine fingers .
oh . so , you read your fan mail now ?
he detested me .
and tell you what became of anna and her mother ..
i don 't want to read anything . can you just get out of my car ?
can i come in ?
yeah .
to love him ?
there 's a friend here to see you .
gus really loved you , you know ?
he wouldn 't shut up about it .
i didn 't find it that annoying .
did you get that letter from your author friend ?
how do you know about that ?
and he said he came all this way to give that letter to you .
i have no interest in reading another word of that asshole 's again .
what ?
mr. van houten , i 'm a good person , but a shitty writer .
i think we 'd make a good team .
let 's go !
outstanding performance !

sarah
better to have two loaded guns when needed .
or of the law-breaking kind .
it 's been such a long time since we 've had a horse here .
probably because we can 't keep ' em alive .
you see there 's some men around here who would like to see this land taken from us .
it was his men you saw here this morning .
they 'll do anything to try and run us off .
mow you 're really tempting me to ask what it is you do for a living .
you come to see my father .
haunted like
afraid of possible repercussions from his actions .
he feared that somehow we 'd be caught up in whatever was coming for him .
she hated it , and she died shortly after we came here .
but there 's good in him , i seen it .
i 'm dying , and my daughter has to watch it .
if i was to oblige you , it would involve a noose .
i 'm no sneak , sir .
that is murderous .
jesus christ , you use murder as a business .
if i hang you , it is by decree of the courts .
pardon the intrusion
no man should endure such pain .
no amount of money or pride or honor is worth all of this .
i do not know how to be still , sarah .

and i have a horrible feeling
so i 'm gonna put the bomb in the trunk ,
i don 't know how this is gonna play out ,
come on .
okay , okay . i gotta push again .
you said it was the only way you 'd take me back .
really ?
andrew ran over carlos ' mother and told no one .
andrew was a child at the time .
orson , please .
i 'm just curious why
i never should have asked you to make that sacrifice .
i respected you for demanding better of me .
you insisted i live up to your standards ,
from the moment you told me what andrew had done
what ?
for god sakes , orson .
we always have a choice ,
you think you can keep patrick occupied for ten minutes ?
oh , man .
yeah : just a little light-headed .
you 're gonna have so much fun in new york .
and you can finally stop running .
right ? i mean , patrick is dead .
is there anything i can do ?
you can give me your permission to do something
what if we don 't say anything ?
the priest knows .
just a suggestion .
this could ruin the hospital .
i know one of these families .
oh , you know what ? i don 't know .
you know who would make a fortune ?
i 'm bored .
cry me a river .
i-i 'm not loving this attitude .
so she 's out all day ?
it 's off .
pilar , i brought you a coffee .
jay , you devil .
it 's beautiful , no ?
all the men in our family wear this .
oh , tradition . oh , it 's so important .
that has been in my family for three generations .
hen .
i 'm just being honest with you .
that 's good . i should be more honest with you sometimes .
i don 't like you , jay .
i knew the answer to that question .
i started by going to see my buddy stavros the florist .
yes ?
oh , thank you .
how good is lamb , huh ?
oh ! gotcha .
i 'm so sorry .
oh , no . no . i ...
so i decided i 'd prove it to them
but , you know , since you 're one of the cool kids ,
hey , lee , it 's phil dunphy from down the street .
listen , we 'd love to have you and the missus over for a glass of wine ,
well , look whose teeth got so nice and straight .
are you kidding ?
i mean , i 'm the last one who should be complaining
let 's just get ready for church .
i get it . just don 't beat yourself up .
really ? you 're taking zero of the responsibility , or ..
maybe just a little .
look , cam , if you 're looking for me to be the bad guy ;
oh , well , maybe i 'll just start today .
i think i already do .
but when he stops trying so hard ,
i 'd like to tell you the story
so it 's morning . my car 's getting waxed .
i hear this adorable accent .
i send over a piece of pie .
couple of minutes later ,
she sits down , we start talking ,
yes !
that 's where she gets it from !
i said i wasn 't gonna cry ,
okay ! that 's it !
fine . everyone just abandon me .
not even this guy .
but you 're an attractive woman with a lot to offer .
i don 't even think i knew what happiness was till i was 60 .
sonia , we 're gonna help you get your own place ,
no , um ..
well , there can be some margin of error ,
that explains it
run !
l just saw owenmajor owen hunt
well , yeah , he was and now he 's here
so .. so we kissed.i mean he kissed me .
but you don 't think he thinks it was a stupid nothing .
what 's he doing back ?
coast clear ?
uh , yes , i did .
thank you , sir
i want you to be the best and if you 're gonna succeed me
with the 24 removable organs
oh , that 's not fair .
dr. yang , what exactly happens in a skills lab ?
damn it .
impossible .
don 't get emotional . bailey .
still ... i 'd like you on my team .
it must have been awful .
get it together three
karev , are you a doctor ?
are you capable of assessing a patient 's injuries ?
like i said , we got it covered .
why don 't you let us just dive in ?
three other hospitals have already sent them away
we can try and cut around the stomach .
so why don 't we take out the stomach and the kidneys ?
we 're talking about
who are those people ?
any luck ?
look , i know you want to be number one richard ,
it 's your call , dr. bailey
what if we just took out each of the organs
even if you take them out one by one
dr. bailey let 's throw some stuff up on the board .
yes ?
what ?
you haven 't been able to look at me all day .
but , hey if you say so .
so instead of worrying
ready
he wants to talk to you about his daughter .
i already told him that .
chiet , you need to go talk to them .
what i hell ?
is that glue ? you used skin glue ?
yeah , well , because dr. hunt didn 't have you
well , he says the e.r is like being in the field .
is it too late for a transplant ?
and a gold star for grey .
oh , put even more synthetic material in her ?
nice work on the valve .
are you done beating me up for the day ?
that attitude that 's from before .
we don 't have to torture live creatures .
you don 't know that you don 't know that .
you don 't know how scared they were .
and then i got discharged .
i knew your name in the before .
you didn 't have anyone .
you 're a living reminder of every failure in my life .
and if i thought i 'm sorry
some end in an uneasy truce .
i know i 'm supposed to but .
don 't let them suffer .
afraid not .
i guess i 'll , uh see you around .
nowhere . he was just downstairs .
we should go to bed , yeah ? it 's getting so late .
all right , i think that 's gonna hold it .
sure .
they didn 't give a shit ,
we can never do that to brandon .
he will .
oh , you picked a good night to start filming .
this is gonna be fun .
he said to hurry over , so we got out of bed and came in .
look . i 've still got my slippers on .
today is the day . today is my transplant day .
gonna get me some arms !
several months ago , a gunman roamed these hse halls ,
we have installed a number of new , uh , security measures .
so what
great . thank you .
i 've been here two hours .
lily , i told you already ,
how have i changed since the shooting ?
uh , i got this .
yes , and yes ,
did you get the parking ticket ?
i haven 't been back to the hospital since that day .
it 's okay . it 's all right .
not too loud , okay ?
some of these kids are in here for weeks .
but i mean , we try to help out .
but a lot of these kids spend a lot of time alone .
doesn 't mean they 're bad parents .
i found out last night that he .
just before the phone rang , i had this ...
motorcycles ...
i know sam would want to donate whatever he could ,
absolutely . i have no problem with that .
what if we try a bypass instead ?
we grew up together , went to med school together .
he 's kinda like my better half .
so when i heard he got shot ..
we tell them their loved ones are hurt
and for the first time in my life ,
no , no , you 're thinking like a nerve guy .
goes blood supply , then nerves .
um , hello , what about the bones ?
to isolate different areas of the hospital in case of an emergency .
even with the kinks , i think people feel safer ,
which is when sam said , " okay , "
after that , every time ...
i 'd catch a glimpse of that tattoo ,
he loves me .
i don 't even like kids .
pediatric surgery
or you 're gonna mess up the test .
lily , you can 't have this in the machine , okay ?
hey , look , guys ,
can we cut ?
things are always evolving around here ..
always for the better .
uh , yeah , i mean , he already has some feeling
you 're the one who 's gonna lose her driving privileges .
all we have to do is keep it from mom
listen to you .
ugh . you sound like mom .
it was a supportive " wah-wah . "
well , i was just trying to salvage that story , okay ?
it did not die . it 's a thinker .
so how long have i been embarrassing you with my stories ?
i love your stories , okay ?
see ? those are funny . you have so many great ones .
rain or shine , there 's always a bumper crop of stories .
phil , why didn 't you just put the extra leaves in the table ?
one long table , honey .
i 'm having second thoughts about this centerpiece .
hear him out .
that 's the plan .
except maybe my sadness will inspire me
you did this . you know that .
so ..
oh , several times .
with cody and the friends ?
but the question is , who here thinks i made that up ?
and here we have the dreamers , the artists , the visionaries .
so we 're supposed to believe that
let 's go to the football field .
yeah ! let 's settle this !
bravo ! bravo ! when i say " punkin , " you say " chunkin " !
i win their hearts and minds ,
some may need more convincing than others .
i know how to deal with a dr. webber .
chief .
thank you , really , but i don 't do caffeine .
noted .
let 's make it a good morning , everyone .
the baby 's coming , but you 're not fully dilated .
pelvic fracture along with bilateral hip dislocations .
the pelvis is broken , trapping the baby 's head .
mindy , we 're gonna take you for some ct scans .
cheers .
nobody ? somebody has to know something .
was that meredith ? she can 't find alex ?
well , i was there last night ,
okay , so we need to do a c-section
okay , murphy ,
any pain when i press down here ?
yeah , we 're gonna take a look at that , too .
i was driving like a bat out of hell .
is she gonna be able to have her baby ?
you probably can 't tell me anything , anyway .
i 'm not her family , just a taxi driver .
just kind of got invested .
almost .
and ...
gonna order a head ct .
you 'll take my lead .
dr. minnick , hi .
that would be amazing .
and , apparently , we need to hire a new peds surgery chief .
murphy , um , can you go make sure
i 'm not actually asking . it 's my job .
it 's my patient .
that seems like a very distasteful way
and richard webber , he 's a friend of mine ,
nothing .
i can 't tell if this is
shouldn 't take long .
barely missed his eye .
we 'll see more once we get in there .
dr. minnick . first day ?
this the hockey kid that got the worst of it ?
he took a stick to the neck
then when will he learn ?
not on this one .
i 'll have mitchell assist .
why isn 't she crying ?
right angle . robbins , pass me the vessel loop .
bryan ,
i could 've told you exactly how that would play out .
i didn 't think you could make it any worse for that poor guy ...
debakey pickups .
scissors ?
i haven 't heard anything about your pregnant lady yet .
damn it !
can i get a nurse over here ? !
and set up for intubation !
is the baby on ecmo ? did you get help ?
in the o.r. i 'll join you .
i was hired here to do a job , and i think it 's time ...
what ?
this rib punctured the lung .
are you kidding ?
you got to shake up the other team ...
garth is the enforcer .
upset the other team .
fights can be strategic , too .
it also rallies the team against a common enemy .
and i thought i was just gonna learn about surgery .
isn 't that why you allowed me into an o.r. ?
you said fighting is the good part , right ?
hey , how goes the battle for hearts and minds ?
well , that sounds like someone who 's won no hearts or minds .
they push back . eventually , everyone gets on the same page .
i 'll call a meeting .
this is not a fight you should be having , dr. minnick .
you do this a lot ?
major surgery on a newborn right here ?
and the mom might already be ..
let 's do this .
i was in path . i was getting a culture .
it 's fine , ' cause i covered for you , but .. talk to someone .
what do you need , warren ?
very simple . if i can 't be a partner ,
where are you ? abby ?
i will call you later .
she won 't listen to her parents !
oh , christ .
i will never understand this crazy country .
coming soon to a theater near you .
just add some graphics over the shot that say , " no one will hear this scream . "
it 's so weird .
let 's have a drink
but then , i needed more .
and so began misha 's career as a marketer-spy .
and because of you and your incredible work ..
okay , so look , abby .
why do you think ?
as a result , restaurant chain dim song
you tell him that now is the time to open and advertise his restaurants .
and tell him that i would suggest not limiting his campaign to russia alone .
following the government 's ban
whether this newfound love of all things vegetable will stick ,
abby , it 's me . everything 's changed now .
i know it sounded crazy when i told you
believe me , i do .
but , perhaps ...
wait , what were you gonna say ?
oh , oh , and , um , i also really like that idea
cedric 's friend is having this
no ... yeah .
well , it kind of depends on the cake situation .
and he 's not the brightest but he 's pretty ,
i am going backwards !
he moved on , so what , so can you .
no drinks , no dinner , just a hook-id .
sure. are you thinking a bar ?
172 classon ave . apartment 2 . brooklyn ny .
sure
oh man , i was .. i was just so sure that i was gonna see
wow , you are really pretty .
uh , anyway , so this is me .
as you can see , it 's a magical wonderland .
um , yes , i think so .
that is awesome .
that will be a very nice thing to happen , megan .
okay .
there 's nothing we can do .
this could be every day .
helicopter me out of here or something ?
this is what i deserve , it 's penance .
um , so you really think god made this blizzard
right , that makes sense .
it didn 't happen .
no , that 's like trying to get
i have seen your penis .
those are big things .
uh , no , no , i did not .
you can 't just ...
i think you underestimate us .
it just keeps coming .
no , i mean the punishments from the universe .
where the fuck is your plunger ?
ah , shit , i let my buddy borrow my plunger , dammit .
yeah , me neither , that was just a test .
yep , i 'm going to do it , i 'm gonna get high .
your apartment .
my buddy made it .
i try to encourage his creativity .
didn 't you make the profile like two days ago ?
what is this , like an interrogation ?
no , i just
home run , twins win the world series !
whoops .
easier than you would think .
work at a bank
i 'm an assistant manager .
kinda 2ross , but .
all of my friends ' parents were divorced , you know ?
i think it kinda messed me up .
good for them . whac ?
oh , no .
i am an epic dancer , but you see .
so you have to stay here .
okay , um ..
and with that in mind
practice on my hand a lot
well , yeah , let 's talk about this .
yeah , what did i do wrong ?
you know , how they fit together .
do you think we did ?
you don 't know what to say ,
it 's not like that changes after the first time .
you can never talk about it openly
wow .
or maybe it 's just me .
you go and you have to do this activity with a partner
what camp did you go to ? holy shit
it 's a pretty good opportunity right now .
yeah .
that 's the international thing .
and that is not a fantasy of yours ?
do you remember what it was that i said ?
and then after i said that ,
um , i mean , honestly ,
i thought i was doing something like that .
okay .
oh , and you went like way too fast ,
oh , okay , all right .
it 's not like we 're competing on some
so next time , just hold the girl ,
i just got off the phone with the governor 's office
i can 't say that , okay .
i can 't take any more critiques .
tried again .
for .
yeah , i think it would be really helpful for me .
okay , get over here .
they should label it or something , right ?
that 's good , yeah , where were we ?
ah , a fan of the bed push .
there 's never a good time for it so , you know ..
good compromise .
i 'm like the un of doing it .
yeah , that 's good
right back at you .
mm-mm .
it wouldn 't even make sense to you .
it 's the burden of being a genius .
it 's not that i stopped wanting to be a doctor .
no , i meant i didn 't change my mind .
whatever it is that you think that you need
i have this .. i got the desk . "
you 're kicking and screaming
like you 're dead .
thank you for staying with me on that
so what happened with that guy ?
so you 've really never had a one-night stand before ?
you look thirsty too .
can i pull a classic girl move
yeah , one sec .
see ? you just did
you have the place to yourself , and , boy ...
when does she get back ?
i heard about that .
it 's not a party , it 's a bunch of people
and i did something stupid , and i 'm sorry .
and what if they 're not ?
okay , so what now ?
he owes me for a plunger .
let me know when you 're out .
can i ask you something ?
megan , right ?
actually they 're asking for you specifically
why ?

he is setting this whole thing up !
he is so crazy that he is forcing me to sound crazy .

oh , no .
maintain the room . wait for two rings , then exit .
i , uh ..
i heard you , i just don 't remember the address , okay ?
you are breaking protocol , cornerback .
i just need the address .
then leave quickly and quietly .
then , go to staraya square , the steps .
grabbed it out of somebody 's yard .
what did he do ? she .
somebody who just
the dollar should be going down , but it 's up .
i think they 're propping us up .
i think there 's a coordinated plot within russia
your room should be clean by now . we 'll put a watch on it .
in about that much water
you 're operational now .
you will avenge our family .
everyone is in place , sir , in america and in moscow .
hi . jack ryan to see mr. cherevin .
how was your flight ?
and the jet lag ?
i survived .
so , you know your history .
routine audit .
not when you 're concealing accounts from us .
but i wonder if perhaps you are just rude .
nothing here is concealed . only secured .
i ordered the companies which concerned you , quite unnecessarily , i might add ,
the funds were transferred this morning ,
i see
dimitri lemkov , our head of security .
i 'm sorry you had to come all this way for nothing , mr. ryan .
but you 've got another problem , jack .
you know , i wanted to make this grand gesture .
so , i 'm here .
i don 't know . but you have to talk to me .
and he already has a job at the auto plant .
a real mother would
he has torn down the strongholds
and its princes down to the ground in dishonor .
to him , something will be off
you got to get her out of here . send her home .
these are dangerous people , cathy . you cannot be here .
i took an oath
no , of course not .
i think you actually enjoyed it .
no , you can 't .
this is geopolitics , it 's not couples therapy .
there 's a very real scenario here where we don 't get out of this alive .
now , we had about eight minutes to discuss this litt
you plug this into any 220 outlet that shares the same wall with him .
how much time will he need to run the program ?
so the answer to your question , yes .
all right .
huh ? what do you think ?
i won 't allow it .
please , sit down .
that 's a rather personal question .
i 'd rather talk than make chit-chat , wouldn 't you ?
trust
i had a misspent sophomore year .
mmm .
desperate , yes . and insatiable .
you don 't understand . aging isn 't the problem .
not if you 've lived a life without regret .
you 're stage three , aren 't you ?
excuse me .
we clean the premises and get the hell out of there .
we are tracking them .
vodka ,
once we break it down .
hat ? the sell order .
tokyo , london , shanghai , a dozen other exchanges .
do you think jack will get to you ?
you think this is game , jack ?
cathy !
you think i will let myself die for nothing ?
you can catch him at the corner . run straight ahead .
now , i have my hand beneath your bitch chin !
so , i will say it once more ,
come on ! let 's go !
the attack is going to happen , ryan !
jack , we need to get out of here .
i got her ! she 's in ! she 's in ! she 's in !
they 're the same kid .
and then he went black ?
by now , he could be anywhere .
he would dump it , right ? he 'd dump it .
bear with me .
there 's a way into him , i know it .
all right , drive safe .
cherevin couldn 't do this alone .
the attending physician , mikhail yureyovich ,
oh , tesus .
get me harper .
discarded tags , auto paint , paint thinner .
tell ebi we can be at the site in ten minutes .
an agent will stay with you .
they murdered the teachers and abducted 17 of the students at gunpoint .
oldest , 13 .
some of my ex-colleagues at the cia feel differently .
that means they 're moving them soon .
has to be done quickly ...
you can name your price .
peace be with you .
are we too late ?
probably biblically .
he 's got nicky and joe .
i 've got to go .
i am truly honored to meet you .
what they are yet , i know not ,
when dr. avery was here ,
richard , this thing is a monster .
i d be operating by the seat of my pants .
a tumor like this calls for a methodical analysis of the scans ,
i didn 't see that coming .
let 's not make this personal .
and you 're right .
" well , my back kinda hurts , but the breathing ....
what :
come on . now try it .
i 've never breathed like that in my life .
i 've never breathed like that in mv life .
what ?
he 's not dead .
dude , you 're lucky you have a famous last name .
my having .. trouble doing that .
when he was 9 , they removed his right lung .
there she is .. by your kidney .
that 's why it was hard to hear your heartbeat .
molly . molly .
do you like to breathe ?
we 're just ..
the risks with the surgery are very high .
would kill me .
uh , so asking you out tonight ...
y-you think ?
cool .
exactly . why not have a little fun ?
eat it and forget about it . right ?
this might be the best idea i 've ever had .
yep , that or kick you off the case .
i 've been doing this a long time , dr. yang .
now ...
if you would like to realign your allegiances .
you mess with him , he might stab me with a scalpel .
what ?
no , it 's not a bad idea . it 's happy and easy .
you know . i-i am telling you , ending it
yeah , let 's go .
i 'm about to do a consult .
uh , lunchtime .
i do things at lunchtime .
i 've done this 300 times , and it 's still not working .
she held up two postage stamps
i am a woman ,
fine . i 'm not putting a gun to your head .
damn it . this is not supposed to be liquid .
you know , what if i 'm no longer .. patient enough
you can do this .
this cyst was massive .
audrey ...
it is a long time .
you are gambling away my daughter 's wedding .
condoms .
they have them in the clinic .
miranda .
okay . anyhow , i would 've pegged you for the diaphragm type .
maybe if owen , uh , agreed to
hunt was more than halfway done
waste .
it 's exactly what my grandfather had in mind
this message was brought to you
you know , we 're not a team .
i watched you today. watch teddy and mark .
you were jealous .
and she 's finally happy .
that 's a team .
mm , tried it . they said it won 't work .
no , they 're just not invested in it like i am .
it 's not liquid .
oh , my god .
i , uh , i don 't know . i don 't know .
i thought i wasn 't seeing you until the weekend .
just didn 't seem right .
that 's a bold move , letting the second years
tell me which one deserves it .
i put it on every year and call it a day .
halloween was ... kind of my family 's thing ,
i 'll figure out what to put on it .
how is this guy stable ?
cops shot him before he ate that other guy 's whole face off .
barely slowed him down .
no . well , we had some candy last night during the movie ,
all right , she has some guarding and a fever ,
i still get to trick-or-treat , right ?
you go around with these huge pillowcases .
he didn 't die .
i thought he was just crazy .
then why didn 't he die ? !
i need you to calm it down , okay ?
it 's just sore .
oh , my god .
uh , walker . marge walker .
mom ? uh , sorry . she 's a little afraid of hospitals .
uh , it says you hurt your leg ?
she 's been popping ibuprofen like it 's candy .
it 's fine . philip , take me home .
just try to relax , okay ?
at first , they were a little bit blurry
i 'm fine .
but i wanna be helpful .
yeah . yeah , fine .
so ... you made all his costumes from scratch , huh ?
i know you think he 's an ass , but he 's not .
don 't even
i 've been doing that . it 's not working .
you 'll be here the whole time , meredith ?
okay . yes .
okay .
she just has to look like a butterfly .
how 'd you swing the time off ?
halloween was always my favorite night as a kid ,
i don 't have the time .
i 'm sorry for saying that you were the wrong choice
because i 've remembered what it is to live for .
so i 'm sorry .
what is that , a fan ?
now if i can get the fan to go in through a burr hole
how have i never thought of this yet ?
it 's only been a week , but , uh , no .
you didn 't think you should put that in her chart ?
thanks for your help , and i 'm sorry
she was just here .
i need an i.v. hydrocortisone and a central line kit .
and get her to the e.r .
this doesn 't look like a hospital .
and philip is bringing some more of your things from home .
do you want me to stay ?
you gotta enjoy it while you can .
yeah , and you can make it to your party .
i am . you know , i 'll show up .
good .
" if you 're coming to the party , could you bring cupcakes ?
um ... it 's no problem if i don 't go ,
or will someone else bring them ?
and when i went to put his into the hazardous waste , i ...
and it jammed right into my palm .
and i had never felt fear like that in my whole life .
enlarge the incision with a dissecting instrument
faster .. but take your time .
he doesn 't want me to tell anyone ,
and you know him better than i do .
i can 't ?
if he told you , he trusted you .
i mean , of course he 's gonna to push you away
well , um , we took a look at your previous incision
there 's a surprise around every corner .
good for you .
what 's wrong ? you still blind ?
also , no hepatitis .
i 've rigged the ceiling with three sunmax ultraviolet lights ...
.... as the sun at high noon .
... i suggest you stand and show yourselves .
i 'm a vampire .
i 'm sure we can handle it .
yes .
we 've gone into nests like this before : seattle , new orleans .
this one might be different though .
whatever it is , i 'm certain she 's brought backup .
yeah . what if she disappears ?
use the daylight as usual .
if it 's daylight , what about you ?
right .
you think this was my fault !
well , fuck you . everything was fine until you showed up .
fuck .
are they still out there ?
.. by evening time as another front moves in from the south .
temperatures cooling down .
so , what do you do when all this is done ?
once we got it done , if i survived ...
... put on my robe .
.. sit on my porch .
... drink it while the sun come up .
but i don 't think like that anymore .
like i wanna put this all behind me .
they won 't come out if we 're near the light .
yeah , well , it won 't be dark for long .
shit .
hold still .
you gotta be quiet now .
can you try to remember ?
i think so .
i saw army boats .
dane !
wait , wait , wait . we cannot be stuck on this ship .
we don 't have a choice .
were blending in with his clients memories
now it seems , senator rockford is betting his political career on mindscape ..
john is here .
i 'm great .
no , i 'm done with all that .
i 'm not there yet .
you should move on from what happened to your wife .
i 'm so sorry . don 't worry about it .
here .. sit down ! sorry .
oh , yeah , yeah . peter lundgren is already working on the case .
c 'mon ! i was better than him on my worst day !
and lundgrens ' success nowadays is close to 100 percent .
as it happens , i , uh ..
her name is anna .
she used to be my patient when she was little .
she 's a teenager now , but i don 't think a ... . a doctor can help .
well , what 's her problem ?
john ...
hi john , i 'm so happy you 're back in the saddle .
into letting her out of the house .
try to find a trauma for her therapist to work on. bye .
when was the last time she ate ?
she 's taking vitamins and drinking water , but nothing else .
i 'm sure anna can get better here .
this is a matter that requires great discretion .
be disseminated beyond michelle and myself .
anna is so special , she 's so many talents , she 's
he died ... when i was pregnant .
does anna get along with robert ?
i see . this way .
she wants to go back to school , but that 's impossible .
we need to protect her .
sweetie . this is john ...
aren 't you late for your aa meeting , mom ?
do you mind ? do you mind ?
that 's quite the party trick you have there .
i like the rhythm when i draw . it 's soothing
at the funeral , she sees this guy she 's never seen before .
and she thinks he 's amazing . he 's everything she 's ever wanted .
but , in the crowds at the funeral , she gets separated
what 's her motive for killing her sister ?
did i get it right ?
depends on what you 're looking for .
the more logical outcome would be for the girl to kill her father .
if the girl didn 't know the man , it 's unlikely her sister would .
so it would make more sense for her to kill her father .
that 's probably true .
what game are you playing , honey ?
you have to be quiet .
mommy 's not feeling well today .
we have a responsibility ! we are not the right people !
come with me , young lady ! dad ! let me down !
for god 's sakes , she 's only a girl !
i 'll show you a picture .
it 's up to you .
and something like lsd in my food would make me act crazy .
they send me to an institution on monday .
please , john , you have to help me prove that i 'm innocent .
i ... i can 't get send away to a mental institution .
are you here for anna or for me ?
but i need to know what happened .
i thought i locked the door .
ah. doesn 't work like that .
know what ?
did he hit on me ?
there 's nothing going on between me and robert
sebastian has it
you said this was a simple case .
maybe you 're not ready to come back .
if you 'd sent me the file earlier , maybe i could have prevented all this .
i 'm anna 's best hope right now .
do you know why you 're here , anna ?
tfor just one day , can we talk about something other than me ?
can you tell me about your relationship with your parents ?
her heart 's like .... one of those fancy ice sculptures they have at parties .
it 's my parents who are crazy .... not me
did he take pictures of you ?
i can still see the exact pattern when i close my eyes .
don 't we all die in the end ?
there are other ways to be free .
then what do you do ?
how do you feel when you draw ?
like nothing else matters .
can i see it ?
can i have your bag ?
my real name is megan , megan scanlon .
what 's she really like ?
beat up a horse or something .
look , just because i 've been assigned to watch over you ..
do you know who might have done this ?
who takes the harmful effects of alcohol very seriously .
hey , anna , look .
oh , don 't worry about it .
can megan come ?
yeah , she is .
roses don 't grow during the winter .
i didn 't do anything to those girls , if that 's what you 're implying
anna blamed it all on another girl , mousey .
not even susan merrick s family was able to take anna to court .
suisan merrick ?
are you a cop ?
what ? has she died or something ?
you think anna was responsible .
miss merrick , i know what you 've been through .
i really need your help .
yeah .. sure i do .
tt was awesome .
no , thanks .
you saw mousey , right ? she did it .
and why would i wipe the poison clean , but leave my prints on the teapot ?
if you 'd wiped the pot , that would point to you .
it was megan , john .
that she smirked at me as i was led away ?
oh , you don 't believe me ? do you blame me ?
you know , who the hell do you think i am ?
i want to know why you 're suddenly turning on me !
asshole
i want you to think about all the key moments in your life by tomorrow .
tine
why don 't you wanna help me ?
who 's there ?
i do
i just simply said i liked watching you sleep .
he was encouraging .. that place was so depressing
i 'm having trouble staying grounded .
you need to be objective , john .
you need to consider that this job is too big and too complex ...
whatever it is , i 'm gonna find out the truth .
i went through all the photos and one of them made me feel something
let 's begin ... . now .
t don ' remember his name .
why don 't you come here ... . next to me .
so , what happens now ?
this is the key to the house my parents lived in when i was born .
so many times in my life people have been unkind .
will you keep this with you at all times ?
who 's on my side .
but i still feel trapped .
she has ... . significant difficulty .
basically , she has developed a protective shell
she interacts with the world in a completely different way than the way we do .
thank you so much , mr. washington .
and once we 've proven my innocence , we went back to that proof ..
because only then , were we able to actually see the truth .
how does it feel to be designated ?
i just downloaded it .
hello ? can you come over ?
anna , look , i need to talk to ..
something terrible has happened and i need to
you have reached the greene 's residence .
confirm seahawk is in the blue zone , but condor is still in flight , right ?
we expect condor to land in an hour .
yes , ma 'am .
i 'm looking at a whole shelf of these annabell dolls .
i have no idea what to buy her .
otherwise ...
moving now .
negative . wait for number three to arrive .
damn it . are they leaving ?
colonel , our intelligence only has them arriving in another half hour .
load up !
if these men leave now , in separate vehicles ..
we have only one eye in the sky .
intercept a suicide bomber on a city street ?
now that 's a guess , of course ,
we have done what we can for her in the time available to us .
we must strike now .
no , i 'm telling you . you need to take it to him .
i 'll leave you to sort that one out , jack .
no , i need that calculation to be below 50 % .
that calculation is already at the lowest limit of what i believe is possible .
i would still have to make that a 65 % possibility on the upper limit .
do you understand ?
we have to make a decision . there are ..
ma 'am .
i think if i make this the point of impact , then ..
that might be possible .
by targeting the missile here ,
thank you , colonel .
do we have authority to prosecute the target ?
i don 't see ' em .
okay , yeah , i got ' em .
how do you know for sure ?
you think they 're here just out for a stroll ?
no , dude , you can 't just start shooting at those guys .
look , i told you , we 're only gonna scare them .
that last shot was way too close !
besides , the point is to get close
you hit that thing , itll scare the hell of out ' em .
then they 'll totally have to
what are we gonna do ? my dad 's gonna kill me !
she looked pretty bad to me , dude . maybe he hit her .
shut up , kevin !
nobody ! because if anyone finds out , we 're all screwed !
turn the music down please , sir .
sir , i need you to take your license out of the wallet .
yeah , take it out
was killed in an attack that
why do you say that ?
yeah
he says that somebody was shooting at him ,
i should have shot that son of a bitch when i had the chance .
don 't know
i know it 's not much for comfort ,
did you already have your boys do a sweep ?
yeah , when ? i told you that yesterday .
check ' em out . they 're marked .
did you get a maker on the vehicle ?
not many guys around who can make that shot .
well , those people got no more
what the hell were you thinking ? was this your stupid idea ?
let me talk . let me talk to him
you know damned well that 's not what happened .
she said one of the illegals asked her to call over here for her .
melina ramirez
please , don 't forget .
it was a good game , son .
have a great time .
okay , brian .
i 'm sorry , you 're okay with that ?
he 's just trying to get a reaction .
a little bit of both .
listen , you can 't be his father and his best friend , brian .
because it doesn 't work that way .
i think it might be better if you traveled by car .
okay !
you 'll be proud of me . i 'm jogging off that .
wait , what ?
doctor garrett will be the physician attending to john .
we 'll come find you as soon as we get him situated .
smith family .
coincidences happen in life .
i didn 't save you , john .
in the water that day ,
well , if there 's a god ..
maybe that 's true for the both of us .
yeah , right there . oh .
we have a little bit of a surprise for you this sunday .
we love you , john !
so i 'll perform what 's called pericardial stripping .
what shall i tell her ?
nice program .
thanks . wait . what ?
you think she 's not gonna make this disappear ?
she 's trimming fat .
that 's pretty fatty .
well , now you 're just making my point .
yeah , start her on 10 mics of dopamine ,
talk to me , bailey . what 's going on ?
brie 's liver won 't last another week .
what happened ?
i tried to find another surgeon while your hand healed .
well , we 're gonna run some scans and some labs
well , we 'll have a clearer idea once we see the scans .
i won 't have time to teach you on this one .
she is our physician advisor .
first thing tomorrow .
are pre-op overnight stays typical in all departments ?
if you 'll excuse me , i have to prep .
typically , you need to be invited .
i wouldn 't be here , now would i ?
brian turner , age 55 .
fell off the damn ladder cleaning the damn gutter .
sir , did you lose consciousness in the field ?
ask the paramedic , not the patient .
um , could we just start over ?
so the injuries we 're most concerned with are ?
correct .
so will that be you or dr. karev ?
yeah . uh , with our cardio fellow dr. yang .
okay .
nothing . i 'm fine .
are we all set for tomorrow ?
great .
maybe , you know , you should just take it easy .
actually , shepherd 's surgery got pushed till later .
that is going to work so much better for me .
well , maybe that , uh , gives us time for coffee .
just time for me to see more surgeries .
what am i
i didn 't want you to feel like the only giant nerd .
yeah .
um , i have 60 million things to do today ,
and that 's not working for me anymore .
i am not too busy for this .
all right .
her last a.s.t. was 23-42 .
bad things happen , but you have to move past it .
so just get over yourself .
so ... now i 'm confused .
i can 't .
mm . okay .
cerebellum and occipital brain tissue .
these are tsunami-force waves , owen .
i mean , is she having a panic attack ?
don 't you have another operation
got it . how 's the facial function ?
come on , jimmy . twitch .
what does that mean ?
we won 't know until he wakes up .
oh , no . did i step on your foot ?
oh . so you cry when you 're happy , too ?
eyes on the liver . learn something .
your m.v.c. is in bed 1
there is no bed 13 .
and your waiting room is clear . nicely done .
do you need something ?
i 've been watching you for two days .
i thought you might need a break .
probably shouldn 't have started
many of them have rare disorders
they .
i have no intention of cutting it .
however , there will have to be some cuts .
oh , i 'm sorry . what ?
we 're a level 1 trauma center .
in the last three days ,
this allowed me to see that in either case ,
over half of whom are non-emergent , under-insured ,
it 's hemorrhaging resources .
this is ridiculous . you can 't close the e.r .
i can 't wait to meet her .
she keeps asking how long amy 's going to be gone .
do you , do you have a boyfriend ?
what are you doing ?
and now , i teach claire .
i respect a woman who can raise a family
taste . taste . taste .
it 'll be fine !
oh , claire , i thought that you had left .
she does have beautiful hair , though .
what did she say ?
at least , i think that 's what she said
after all , she 's my mother .
weren 't you on a specified walk ?
it 's potluck .
the store works ' cause we have rules .
" we gonna salt bae your ass . " what a douche .
" salt bae your ass . "
he 's a butcher who salts his meat in an elaborate way .
dad , you look tired .
when we find this horde , i 'll take a mental health day .
i have a new tenuous theory .
sometimes , i admit ,
i can tell he 's given up .
he thinks he was a mistake .
he didn 't .
but he 's trying to make sense of who he is .
yes , ma 'am , we are .
this is an enormous amount of sedation .
when they first brought him here ,
he has this notion
yes , it would .
you hear me ?
step back against the wall , please .
i have to get out of here before he gets out .
david .
it is possible that there was
you believe you have barely enough strength to stand up .
madam , i am mr. pritchard .
specifically , japanese , 1950s through the 1980s .
it happened seven minutes ago .
i estimate i have two to three minutes left .
he 's the anarchist .
this all sounds very familiar , doesn 't it ?
hey , what wing are you with ?
i believe .
and i understand how important what we 're doing is .
keeping order .
spread your wings , mr. k.g. bird .
i couldn 't ... i couldn 't find a way out .
the roadside motel is one of the most common road cons for a horror fi
would it be ok if i use your phone ?
right on cue .
well be back on the road before you know it .
well , he couldn 't have just disappeared .
what : it 's haunted ?
actually , according to my internet research .
there has to be a rational explanation .
everyone keep an eye on your partner .
ahh !
wait a minute .
we will find a way out !
what ?
we 're leaving together .
pez cat , what do you see ?
but it looks like a cowboy .
what ? 2000 dollars
happy trails , cowboy andy .
combat carl would have liked to see billy just one more time .
well find a way .
sound fixing arrives in any minute now .

ok . , i 'm looking , i 'm looking .
jones , jones , we got another gold mine .
yeah , you got a gas for the flat-tire that needs fixing
it 's no use . i 'm not tall enough .
together we will be able to reach the handle
what ?
and you are gonna be in one of them .
no , no way . i can 't . i can 't do that .
there 's gotta be another way .
ah , gave up drinking
three years without a word .
she missed you , you know ? really worried about you .
he was a great chef .
that is something , huh ?
this is adam . kinda notorious , back in the day .
i need a job .
okay , pal .
mr. jones ?
there 's no longer sufficient funds available
tony said to tell you that your knives are in the bag .
hlm .
yeah . and yogurt , too , yeah .
is what a joke ?
hmm . no joke .
they don 't kick you out if you talk to yourself ,
no , not here , no .
i prefer to eat food cooked by a proper chef .
mr. jones , i 'm a sous chef . i 'm a person on minimum wage .
sorry . " people like me " ?
excuse me ?
consistency is what every great chef strives for .
i wish i could say it was nice seeing you again , mr. jones ,
one hoped you were dead .
i don 't close good restaurants .
i need you to help me kick this arrogant city 's ass .
you know , when i lie awake at night and list my regrets ..
oh , long walks in walden wood .
you have a disease ; there 's no shame in seeking help .
you 'd be more than welcome to join . you could make the sandwiches .
in my experience , people who come in here and make silly comments
do you have a fear of needles ?
did you ever see that movie , seven samurai ?
chef
doomed youth is romantic .
please don 't think that 's on the house . you pay your way like everyone else .
if you have any humanity left ,
she thinks you should be in a program or in a group .
an e-mail came addressed to you .
maybe not that busy .
table four , right now ! clean the pass !
yes , chef . coming , chef .
twenty seconds , chef .

his cooking style is out of date .

well , the mercy of your enemy is a kind of hell .
i have no idea .
that 's your verdict , is it ?
le saint sauveur .
after doing 18 hours at jean luc 's ,
and ? we fucked it up .
fucked it up a long time ago .
yeah ?
which makes you the best .
now , finish that and go .
i didn 't get my third star .
well , come on then . group doesn 't start for 20 minutes .
you 're a very lucky man .
the debt was as much mine as yours .
this is heroin , not breadcrumbs .
what career , mateo ? what career ?
i 'd like to add that , including this latest seizure ,
have you gentlemen seen enough , or will you stay for the weather ?
and put : " body found in candelaria . "
angel ?
get up . help me find the drugs .
what am i supposed to do with you guys ?
look the other way .
i hereby inaugurate the world expo fair in seville .
testing their fate , they call it .
thank you , reverend .
now , the holy ghost is going to visit
what is it you 're most afraid of ?
get out of that little house for a bit .
seven years later ,
be fine to pray outside and adore them trees .
theodore will be all right sitting in the car .
just be you and me , sweetheart .
he was the only kid on the school bus who wasn 't somebody 's relation .
you 're coming out back with me today , boy .
second time .
them boys might be bigger than you .
you understand ?
now , you pray on what happened today .
fuck .
can i come with you ?
didn 't you hear anything i said ?
well ?
well , shut your mouth . we both know that ain 't never gonna happen .
it 's all right .
i know you 'd probably rather be doing something else .
lenora ! arvin !
i 'll be praying for you .
my sister 's boy from down in tennessee
well , i would appreciate it if you all would try and make him feel welcome .
sure ..
and i see ..
and i suspect that the folks that carried them platters in
but poor people ...
so them organs ..
telling me that i should ,
you 're saying you don 't ...
i 'm saying you must be crazy .
look , my advice to you , girl ...
oh , shoot .
you have to be patient with me while i get a few shots off .
the thought of killing carl and taking off with the boy in the backseat
tell you what , son . why don 't you ste ...
no ! calm down , please !
i don 't want to shoot .
carl , you want sandals or heels ?
serial murderers aren 't the most trusting kind .
poor sandy never stood a chance .
jim lacey .
carl never photographed a more symmetrical face .
jim had been their first .
who 's gonna bury jack ?
i don 't know who 's gonna wanna touch that thing .
my daddy didn 't do anything like what your daddy did up there ,
and there was nothing to do but forget his sorry ass .
arvin thought about the days leading up to his mother 's death ,
fuck the blood and stink , the heat and the insects .
arvin said to himself .
arvin russell !
sorry about that !
i ain 't here to hurt you !
come on out so we can have us a talk !
i figured this might be where you 'd come .
that was an awful thing your daddy did .
put the gun down , sheriff ! i got one pointed right at you !
i played as a schoolboy , we got beat in the semi-final .
so ' i was desperate to win it , absolutely desperate
we 'd be winning four , five , six-il most weeks .
he 's scored !
one of the things that i remember is butty 's overhead kick you know .
there was only going to be one result for this team , it was just
wasn 't right to do these kinds of things .
having coaches like nobby that had done what he 'd done in football
having bryan robson play in an a-team game with me , next to me .
i 've seen giggsy and lee sharpe and a few of the guys out and about in town
but it 's not our place to do that , is it ?
.he 's getting dressed .
bedroom just , you know , putting his jacket on .
hid in the wardrobe , they 've hid under the bed ,
of them jumped out ' the window .
so anyway , he 's caught me and sharpey red-handed .
and he was making body movements without even touching the ball .
i just saw him going through , going through , keeping on going .
look at scholesy , look at scholesy .
just for everything , how important it was ,
and throughout that season they all delivered .
but giggsy 's moment is the stand-out moment .
look , who 's to know what 's going to happen in football , gary ?
those supporters will be talking about that for years .
that 's what football 's about .
we 're in a final , we 've got something in the bank for ourselves .
ii mean , the place went wild ,
watch the footage of scholesy ... i got into the goal .
probably thinking , what am i doing ?
i think everyone that looks at us , they all think about .
west ham away .
the first year that we broke in properly was ' 95 ,
i wasn 't probably at that stage of my career where ti felt comfortable to sort of ,
i didn 't know whether it was going to. be all right or not , you know ?
n 't know whether it was going to be all right or not , you know ?
you know , you 'd be
not intentionally .
well , a little , bit intentionally ,
.so , if you were new , or if. you were a foreign player ,
we didn 't have the combinations between yorke and cole
and all of a sudden , with about 15 minutes to go ,
teddy came on . ole came on .
disaster for roy keane .
if people ever sort of doubted , how good a player butty was ,
what a guy .
ck to fundamentally what it was abo
you know , it should only be a matter of
it was like the game was over then .
as soon as the final whistle went
here we go . everybody , ready ? grab that . grab it .
too many people . get out .
she 's the best there is .
yeah , it makes me look like a complete moron
i 'm sorry , but suck it up .
it 's gonna be all right .
she has got a hole in her heart .
bypass would mean a lot of heparin .
she 's not stable enough to wait .
this is callie , okay ?
yesterday we were at her stupid baby shower .
you can be callie 's baby 's godmother .
the only way to save the baby is to save callie ,
i know it hurts .
don 't fight the intubation . this won 't take long .
with your eyes , okay ?
what about one finger ? can you move one finger ?
it 's too soon to tell anything .
she opened her eyes
derek , did she follow commands ?
no , nothing else .
both stab wounds to the chest ,
live for me .
you both love callie .
what happened ?
belly 's tight as a drum .
abdominal compartment syndrome . she 's bleeding out .
we should say a prayer .
i haven 't stopped praying since yesterday .
remove the abdominal packs carefully .
we 've got blood !
we gotta go back in .
dr. altman , we can still do the percutaneous repair .
dr. yang , the decision 's already made .
she 's well-groomed , she has a job , works as a librarian ,
we can 't fully explain the phenomenon of hoarding .
and , in her case ?
for her , it 's about ... safeguarding memories .
family is everything .
think we found mr. santiago ?
maybe she didn 't want to spring for the urn .
it 's not the crime scene that 's bugging me .
well , look , nick , you 're talking about a woman here ,
there 's no excuse for this .
that 's your theory . i don 't think so .
and you guys can finish up this room .
well , i got a feeling this is not the last body
indications are male caucasian ,
this is some kind of twisted .
my understanding of it is that
you don 't think both daughters were being held here , do you ?
alisa and the boys ...
so everything i heard is true .
well , the evidence indicates that she was here for a while
so i was able to recover
the owner faxed me the credit card receipt .
so what ? he also has a carry permit .
all the hard evidence points to mrs. santiago .
there were alisa 's prints and her mother 's prints .
all right , what about the second boy ?
matthew price , six months ago .
we need to find that roll of ribbon .
you guys got a picture ?
go ahead , doctor .
stacked near the dresser .
it should be to the right of the window near the bed .
this could take till christmas .
meanwhile , back in the 21st century .
it 's not so bad , really .
in india ,
oh , look , now he 's boring on an international scale .
is that who i think it is ? it can 't be .
sheldon , i owe you an apology .
i 've actually got a shot at a terminator .
when it comes to terminators ,
i have 11 hours with her in a confined space .
my money 's on tuck and roll .
i thought you-were involved in some sort of
hang on a sec .
um , well , let 's see , couple reasons .
why do you have to give your paper to george smoot ?
so you 'll send him an e-mail when we get back .
right. of course .
well , there 's nothing you can do about it , so relax .
only ten hours , 55 minutes to go .
must be summer .
okay , i 've found the perfect solution .
hello ?
i 'm about to give you a set of instructions ,
and the director is brilliant .
okay , great , i 'll see you then .
do you see that small plastic case on my dresser ?
i 'm not in san francisco .
uh , no , i was talking to my friend , but what 's up ?
i 'm in a crisis situation ,
hi , penny. it 's leonard .
but can we at least go in there
it 's so cold out here
so close i almost smelled a 100 .
if i wanted you to keep lying to me ,
according to my social security number ,
bankers have more guilt at christmastime
i 'm the one with the business degree ,
you 're the business genius . what do i know ?
i 'm barry .
we 're not allowed to say christmas .
oh , you 're " selling . "
i 've been clean since fire island 2010 .
it must be hard to not be high and be you .
yeah , you get it , girl .
otherwise i wouldn 't be standing here
tell han while he gets back to work .
i 'm gonna lose the christmas decorating contest.ashvsash.com
i never thought i 'd be jealous of a fuse .
we are way behind with these t-shirts .

han 's doing the last one . we 're gonna make it .
i 'm just so happy i have new clothes .

you really are a little angel .
oh , i was asked , but i declined .
we won !
we won ! we won !
dump the kid , i 'll be upstairs .
remember , we have no choice .
okay , 3b , here . this is the puppet guy 's apartment .
you say apartment , i say the brightest dot
we 're charming , we 're sorry ..
well , i am .
let 's just get in and out of there .
nothing . he 's gonna sue us ,
pierre ?
i 'm sorry , we 're not open today .
we 're not open .
well , not us , but a new friend of ours
relax , i could never be that cruel .
look who it is , pierre , your lover , j. petto !
he had a girlfriend named lulu .
hunt 's not cut out for the job .
nothing happened .
he 's got fear in his eyes .
what do you think got to him , call schedule , lunch order ?
you 're a good man .
just watching the magic .
you paged . what 's going on ?
okay , first of all , there 's no such thing
there was spinal fluid all over her bed .
just checked on her . she 's stable and pain free .
that 's become a nightmare , too .
like magic , there was no scar at all .
are you gonna keep this up all three days ?
oh , god .
are you there ?
karev !
sofia rolled off the sofa last night ,
yes .

when i get home , and it turns out that my girlfriend ,
i just spent the last nine hours standing around
i am .
who 'd you sell it to , anyway ?
morris ?
how much did you get for it ?
what 's wrong with you ?
i basically have to start all over .
i 've never heard of anyone making money from writing .
well , i am . i 'm a star , my love .
and the book that i 'm writing for six months
they ransacked homes .
they imprisoned hundreds of human rights activists .
people who only aspired to gather peacefully in la havana .
do you have anything to say about the situation in cuba ?
for all cubans craving freedom , the hour of truth has arrived .
imagine here !
can you get ivett to daycare ?
olga , can you follow me a moment please ?
please , have a seat .
look , as far as i know , you haven 't been convicted of anything .
i 've had my own problems with the fbi .
please let me come .
and you must watch your sister .
tell daddy i love him .

well , i have some big news
mm , i like this one .

i do say that a lot ,
mm , mm , mm . look at you .

look how far you 've come .
hey , and check you out now .
we haven 't used starbucks napkins
we 've got a meeting with paul platt .

earl , slow down , your heart .
but if i run any faster , the cops tend to pull guns on me .
aww , earl , you got us flowers ?
black .... . no , no , no , i don 't see any blacks here .
let me check with paul platt , the party planner .
hey , brody .
there 's a problem with the list .

i 'm almost dressed .
and speaking of " in your face , "
damn , girl , you look good . what you doing later ?
martha stewart is perfect .
the woman probably doesn 't even go to the bathroom .
and how are you this evening ?
oh , i never said that !
eat it , red haired lady and your asian daughter !
it 's like there 's a serial killer out there
seriously , we have a big problem .
and there 's our little problem .
i am not gay . i 'm restaurant curious .
no way . no new menu additions .
pick up ! pulled pork .
it 's $ 4 toast .
that 's $ 5 more than our toast is worth .
at first , i was reluctant to put something so big in my mouth .
oh , look , oh , my gosh !
yes , that 's a match !
that 's another big yes !
ashvysash.com sorry , i just haven 't heard the word " popular " in so long .
she 's the blockbuster video of people .
just say it already . come on .
i wonder which reality show it is .
keep up .
sophie , thank you so much for letting us come up
that was another time i was on fire .
" kim gets a new hat . "
now that one 's a classic .
i like to go to sleep with the sound of kim 's voice .
" this is super awkward . "
it 's too bad we all didn 't live to see 20 .
you know i need someone to make me laugh .
stop !
that 's it , we 're done .
i know , i know , but we couldn 't stop
is the blonde one crying ?
can we please call it make-up remover ?
it 's almost empty .
stop it ! just squeeze some out
please tell me it 's working .
i don 't think i can get your hair out .
who could that be ?
oh , we were just talking about you .
okay , tell me if this sounds familiar .
you push your way to the bar ,
meanwhile , she leaves with a guy who claims
what time should i be at your mother 's ?
i swear , that man is the most egotistical ,
like burt and ernie .
well , i 've had it . i am done .
where are you going to go ?
that 's a bit of an ethical conundrum .
so , uh , what 's your plan moving forward ?
what a task that will be .
you ready for breakfast ?
okay , rai , listen to me .
but i have a cream sherry hangover
oh , howard , stop .
that 's how they get you .
i can leave whenever i want .
they 're on the chair , right over ..
she 's not gonna bathe me , is she ?
all right , well , thanks again for helping me out .
should we go back and rescue him ?
we 'll see him at his bar mitzvah .
and she doesn 't know it .
they said i can go in the morning .
i want to be on the other side of it .
hi , son .
thanks , sir .
come on in .
hello ?
i got this number when i activated your new phone .
i 'm sorry . i don 't think i 'm going to .
who ?
what are you talking about ?
when you were in the hospital ,
they tracked me down using my cell phone ,
police haven 't been able to do a thing .
i get you don 't know where to turn ,
you want to get back at these guys ?
i mean , it has real resources ,
what 's that ?
because it came out of your head .
okay , i 'll throw it out .
what story ?
it 's hilarious !
oh , look , there 's another hilarious story !
i have hair extensions .
i murdered a man in rhode island .
too bad it doesn 't give you depth .
is she sick ?
no , little you .
so where are they ? i checked all your drawers .
you already know the answer , so i 'm going back to sleep .
and all my pillowcases would have edges .
what was it like anyway ?
did caroline join a bowling team ?
aw , crap !
let her have some fun . what 's the big deal , square ?
it was a pillowcase , and i need it to sleep .
in poland ,
what was it ?
give me the pills .
and , max , you were wrong . see ?
all right . take it easy .
why 'd he call you mrs. tucker ?
no , seriously . w-why is he messing with you ?
um , i told him how i would love to go
hold , please .
i don 't care .
oh , see , you said " i don 't care " twice .
why are you still here ?
here .
i just wanted a night alone , okay ?
so , go !
i didn 't say that .
and you 're not not being needy .
it 's already packed ?
bye . i love you . okay .
hi , honey .
oh ! wow . look at that .
well , i lost a dress and the house smells like smoke ,
right ?
either end the damn story or don 't even write it !
god , for a minute , i thought i missed something .
the chance to read a great book on your one night alone .
nice cut . perfectly cooked .
this training , it 's part of who i am about to become .
my name is dimah tchakova .
it 's been kind of hard , but i think structure guides people .
no , i don 't think it 's too severe .
it 's not a game .
i need to be good at this , because i believe in this war .
i can 't really say stuff like that at this school ,
i think they 're selfish .
it 's not right .
being a squad leader means i am their leader .
they call me " the robot " behind my back , but i don 't mind .
i don 't think we 're supposed to fit in
i feel like i 'm meant to be here .
being a soldier isn 't about mindless violence .
would i be able to take another life ?
after all , it 's kill or be killed .
i don 't think i could kill another human being ever .
we 've been floating aimlessly in space
over four years aboard this ship with nothing to do ,
for four years , all i 've done is think .
i hate you .
we are at war with insurrectionists ,
every single one of you at this academy was sent here
well , what are you waiting for ?
oni 's hiding stuff from us , i 'm positive .
stop stepping on our dicks , lasky !
nah , sully , vickers is right .
don 't bother , jj . he 's gone soft .
all right , you 're especially gonna love this .
we see this river , me and the boys ,
yeah , i did .
i almost ruined my body suit a couple times ,
volcano ! volcano !
the strategy used in earth 's second punic war
it does seem a little basic .
why ?
never underestimate your opponents .
questions ?
yeah , we don 't have horses .
what happened ?
my chest feels like it 's on fire .
it 's a drug we inject to keep ice crystals
so i won 't be able to breathe every time i wake up from cryo sleep .
i 'll know more in a few hours .
yes , sir .
hey , bro .
it 's day , uh ...
i 'm doing real good work here .
rich didn 't make it .
he was right there next to me and then ...
a pineapple sent him flying in four different directions .
he said it 'd make me look tougher .
i got to go , bro .
what matters is that our soldiers
cadet lasky ?
how are you feeling ?
this is for you .
i don 't understand , sir .
if you feel that you are unfit for service ,
tomorrow .
at the end of the game ,
all of his squad perished .
there are no remains to bury .
colonel lasky out .
lasky , move over . i gotta show you something .
no , it 's important .
it 's offline .
they must have flagged those coms .
that sounded close !
what the hell 's invisible ?
it 's coming . we got to get out of here !
where are we gonna go ?
but really , you 're not .
they just look like you .
we 'll shake hands
well , i 'm 28 .
oh , i 'm terribly sorry .
thank ou .
now , i come back the next year and i have no idea where i am .
i suppose we 're rather old-fashioned .
i like it . it 's comforting .
i 'll leave my card for you on the table here .
hadn 't forgotten the schedule .
we 'll see you tomorrow morning .
is there anyone at the stage door ?
that 's okay . i 'll just go .
i 'll see you tomorrow .
it 's a prime slot , so ...
of the three of us , i was by far the most supportive .
how will rai ever reach true greatness
okay , let 's try it this way .
i had not considered that .
oh , sorry .
something more suited to your status .
how about if i put you in von gerlich 's old office ?
damn , this is hard .
what do you think the business of this place is ?
and this boy 's picture in people magazine
who doesn 't ?
i didn 't even know there was a president 's dining room .
come on , little buddy .
see you tonight , guys .
so anyway , after a fantastic lunch ,
uh-uh. no .
apparently , the camera loves me and i , lit
right , a ball of hot , flaming gas
oh , it 's my assistant , trevor .
they gave him an assistant
not yet .
okay. so , saturday night , can i count on my posse ?
oh , okay. leonard ?
sheldon ?
a tremendous accomplishment would be
i 'd go to that reception .
raj is gonna be in people magazine ,
of course i would .
shame on you guys .
i can 't believe it took you a whole year .
i 'm going to be in people magazine .
i have a limo . i just love saying " limo . "
um , yeah. why , what 's wrong with it ?
it can 't be racist .
let 's just eat so i can get to bed .
did you remember to ask
yes. brown rice , not white ?
did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market ?
fine .
i want you to check before you accept the order .
that may well be ,
they could be murderers or the carriers of unusual pathogens .
if we do get a new friend ,
i 'll draw up an order and get it before a judge .
how ?
security camera only shows sara stepping up and firing at the victim .
that 's the least you could do ...
goodbye , theodore .
after the mothers come back here , the depression 's almost unbearable .
it 's less messy , if you just think of yourself as a surrogate .
michael , it 's blue phillips .
someone tried to poison her .
but leave saro alone .
.. if you were killed , your pain would last a moment .
now , that 's got to be appealing to whoever put out this hit .
.... if i find out anything , i 'll be sure to let you know .
i remember you have two missing toes that can attest to that fact .
please .
if i grant her , everybody 's gonna want one .
is there something i should know about the structural integrity of the shu ?
let 's move on , shall we ?
.. as special agent in the federal bureau of investigation .
thank you for the invite .
you know , alex , this ruling can be revisited ...
are you kidding me ?
shut up and don 't bring it up again . what 's all that ?
covering seven different escape attempts ..
no , i didn 't put her in prison . the state of florida did .
so where 's all your little buddies ?
what else did you get ?
motor pool is here .
if she understood my letter , she 'll find a way to tell me .
attention all inmates . visiting hours will be over in five minutes .
tell me you completed your assignment .
the woman we hired is having trouble getting near sara tancredi .
careful i don 't get there first ..
all right , from take off , the prison 's gonna come up real fast .
you got it .
good . that means t-bag 's set .
it 's not my first time inside prison .
think about all the amazing stories you 'll be able to tell your kid .
someone to look up to .
unless you 've got details i 'm hanging up . you can forget getting your badge back .
i was worried about my little girl on the outside .
see if someone will watch over her .
yes , sir .
you think sucre made the drop on time ?
no , no , no .
three , four , eight , pound .
and i know exactly how he 's gonna do it .
just light a fire in my cell and the rest will just take care of itself .
if anybody so much as bends a blade of grass in this place ..
what are we waiting for ?
for the right price , t-bag would set off the fire alarms .
so you used to do business with sleepy ?
old bastard smoked all the time .
accidentally .
you were always running around here ,
let 's get you a gun , yeah ?
i 'll take it . and a suppressor if you 've got one .
but it turns out you would 've .
either way ...
yes , he did . now get out .
i said get out !

you say it involved my daughter ?
her necklace ?
travers . fbi . kidnapping squad .
you were too busy talking ..
i was trying to figure out what they know .
even the sultana 's body must be viewed by the next of kin .
mr. fbi-kidnapping-expert .
the cops . while they wait for a ransom .
like the key respect , that the sultan refused to talk before the vizier .
because when i kissed his hand , he gave me this .
it 's fine if you want to cry , sultana .
there .
who are you ? really .
we are doing this right now .
it 's hard , man . he followed me everywhere , you know ?
i dropped out of school . he drops out .
and he comes all the way to baghdad , to be like his big brother .
get back ! get back !
where are they ? where are the jewels ?

i 'm fucking afraid , zack .
he is , max . and you should believe that , max .
you can do this . you can do this , we 're almost home . we 're almost home .
isn 't it enough that when i see them on the street ,
you can afford to open the diner for one night .
what happened to all your " money 's not important "
no , no . i 'm just saying that it 's okay for you
look , they 're hiring elves .
come on . if we get hired ,
come on , max , we 'd be great elves .
and we 're both so desperate for money ,
the man 's in prison , and he thinks this is depressing .
it 's really not that far .
call me on thanksgiving . love you .
he said he can 't face having me see him in there .
fine .
everyone in this corridor has been chosen to be an elf .
because i was talking to those people over there ,
and i 'm blond , baby !
but those period costumes are so much prettier .
we are in this together . now go get your bells on .
talk about a period costume .
i can 't do this anymore .
i feel tired and wired at the same time .
all right , calm down !
look , we are not going anywhere , okay ?
i can 't . it 's embarrassing .
now i 'm sad .
and is there a drug test involved ?
i had my uterus yanked out on my lunch hour , and i was back at my desk by 2 : 00 .
unless , uh , you don 't want that extra $ 2 an hour .
that extra $ 2 an hour
i 'd double-check those tights if i were you .

anna m. means love in french . cheers .
john mckee , the big boss .
i hear dorothee will be looking after you .
i take serious risks in doing so .
my life for your love .

we 're gonna buy you a new dress .
like i can give a shit if she plays chess !
knives , 100 % . driving .
oh , but she 's not the profile we 're looking for .
kgb needs smart agents who can size up situations ,
she has been trained with that in mind .
she 's highly intelligent .
" like a captive cast to the bottom of a deep , dry well ,
chekhov .
that 's what 's important .
yeah , another time .
that 's what i do . only nobody pays me .
i 'm expected to find five or six girls each trip ,
you 're doing it wrong , my friend .
we look for something unique . pearls . gems .
not even in moscow .
no leverage .
she has been well trained .
" attackers may sometimes regret bad moves ,
now , you have questions ?
one in training , one on mission .
or i can go anywhere i want ?
with all due respect ,
he 's divorced , no kids .
he can 't be bought . so we have no leverage for blackmail .
let me guess .
we 've already sorted things out on that end .
where is the piece ?
there will be no backups . so if there 's a hitch ..
bring me the attache case , keys ,
which room ?
yeah , i 've read it .
you expected me to .
how can you expect us to compromise him
no . no . it was my mistake .
while you 're there , bring back your watch .
why are you still here ? go .
are we done ?
can i go to bed now ?
what are you doing here ?
you could have called .
everything okay ?
good . we 're all good on our side , and we 're all clear .
damn straight .
why are you really here ?
you ... you put the idea in my head . you said bahamas .
yeah . hopefully someone better .
christ , that guy was a prick .
it took time , but you got back at ' em .
good .
dead , probably . if she 's lucky .
he was in moscow when vassiliev was killed .
hey , get me the fuck out of here .
yes , sir .
all agents , move ! move ! move !
let me help her , tchenkov .
she 's gonna die .
i think it would be preferable if you left first .
i insist .
yeah , hi , honey .
anyway , he 's in the chickadee suite at the mount blue motel
hofstra ? hello ?
and who we hope in our hearts to become . "
okay , look , um , i just assumed after a couple of years ...
i misjudged that and i am really sorry .
suddenly he 's singing his heart out on the edge of the earth
he loved it up here .
he loved you and you 're from up here .
can i get that out of the way for you ?
and then before all the tours and the radio play
you know , what happened ?
yeah .
hey , hannah , just let me talk to you , okay ?
you got your theories about consumer blah-blah , but here 's the deal .
okay , will you .... . hold on , all right ?
1ook , i just want to say , man , i 'm sorry .
you know , i hope you get promoted or rich or on " the view "
that sucks , because he would have
i mean , hell , you got cobain , buckley , arbus .
on and on , you know ?
hannah , you 're attempting the impossible .
yeah , well , thank you , upton ,
well , hello there , miss hannah miles .
i 'm good . how 's new york ?
oh , can 't do that , hannah .

oh , you freezing ? you freezing cold ?
i didn 't see .... see you get here .
i 'll give you two guesses .

our neanderthal cousins were constantly locking themselves out .
yeah , she 's curious . it 's all right .

you don 't get to say that .
hmm ?

his recording studio is a shrine , you know ?
hannah , there is grief and then there is worship .
i paid you everything i had left .
private grice , call major smith .

four , the slipper as pure as gold .
" tis then the blue moon reappears ,
go to the wood
the f 'estival ?
surely , you can let me be there for one of them .
you 're missing all the flowers
you frightened me !

i can 't just take a cloak from a little girl .
it 's the rules .
i 'm not allowed to touch any of the objects .
hello there , little girl .

i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry . i just wanted to make sure
i 'd rather a wolf than you any day !
i 'm never gonna find that red cape ,
the cow as white as milk
you need to be more careful , young lady .

the prince danced only with her ,
quickly !

the boy is hiding in the steeple tower !
there 's a giant terrorizing the kingdom .
the prince ?

i had to disguise myself
i mean , you 'll be safe in our company .
it 's this way . my wife is somewhere .
now i must go off to slay a giant .
and how alive you 've made me feel .
was that me ? was that him ?
and kiss me ? and kiss me ?
there 's the answer , if you 're clever
is it always " or " ? is it never " and " ?
and to get what you wish only just for a moment
lost the beans again punish me the way you did then
maybe i shouldn 't have strayed from the path .
yeah , maybe you shouldn 't have .
away from here .
it doesn 't matter if we 're together or we 're apart .
you don 't understand !
she was the one who helped .
he 'll be happier in the arms of a princess .
i thought that if you were mine ,

my father 's house was a nightmare .
i couldn 't agree more .
greg pemberton , you old so-and-so .
uh , let me introduce you to my colleague , dr. campbell .
great to meet you . well , you have my number .
nothing beats a lap dance and a baked potato bar , huh ?
that 's a hard pass .
good to see you . barry .
god , i hate that guy .
iwas only being polite . pemberton is a grade a weasel .
have literally never said that to you .
pemberton 's whole m.o .
that 's exactly what he 's doing to us .
you want proof ? i can make some calls .
i really don 't want to see that guy win a nobel .
ooh , this is tricky .
well , let me know if you change your mind .
so i was talking to my mom
apparently , old testament god would bring down his wrath
you know , i asked her that very question .
sure , what 's up ?
if we have damaging and embarrassing information about someone ,
i know all about your tall girl website .
it 's dr. pemberton .
wow . well , that 's not gonna sit well with the nobel committee .
relax , he said it 's not you .
okay , now you just sound crazy .
it wouldn 't just knock pemberton
okay ? we-we know it wasn 't penny ,
how do we know it wasn 't susan ?
don 't make me say it .
the cars they drove , the color of their eyes ,
you sure you 're not thinking about your husband ?
almost like he was guilty or something .
i mean , leonard has resting guilt face .
then why are you acting guilty now ?
but that just means you didn 't do anything wrong ,
now that i know , i 'm implicated .
i also wanted you to be my jester
there was only one princess , and it was me !
sheldon , if someone were gonna do something
can 't help myself ; i 'm a fact addict .
and that 's a fact .
what ? you told him ?
that 's the point . i 'm doing it .

it could be both .
but i 'm gonna go with my reason . yours is too complicated .
okay .
howie .
w-while i was there , i started asking myself ,
and i just wanted you to know that .
because the only woman i want to creep out
thank you for meeting us .
we never say no when someone wants to buy us lunch .
really ? apologies go down easier
there 's something we have to give you .
uh , we have proof that you plagiarized your thesis .
go ahead .
i don 't want him spreading this thing if it 's contagious .
like that , someone can play god to you .
invisible , like a malevolent forte beyond the firmament .
find out if it gets us ?
but if we 're not showing symptoms at this point , we might be in the clear .
c amos .
what do you got ?
it 's not affecting other species .
it 's not a compound .
makes it something no one 's ever seen .
covenant 's found their holy grail , then , haven 't they ?
when we 're supposedly not even at war .
why not hit population centers like gannick 22 ?
told to carry some things to a landing site and not to ask any questions .
he couldn 't find out what he was carrying ,
a place so doomed even the elite zealots won 't go there .
if we work backward through the tugs positioning ,
half a dozen charred planets around it , but that 's not the interesting part .
that 's alpha halo .
the weapon master chief destroyed .
be a major peace violation if anyone went there .
you think this is where they 're sourcing the element ?
before the explosion .
you got a point , private , get to it .
element range 120 to 130 .
expand search .
looks like we got a one-off .
native to this little piece of halo ring and nowhere else .
launch it from a destroyer .
what do you got , estrin ?
looks like someone 's going back to no man 's land .
and no one walks away from the spartan program .
fast forward 10 years and suddenly i 'm looking at your colonel .
except his name is not randall , it 's aiken .
let 's make this easy , huh ?
shut up and save the bull for the ride out .
whoa there , boy . whoa !
hell is going on , macer ?
talk to me , condor . what the hell is going on ?
it 's your technology !
they sense it !
we 've learned not to bring technology to this place .
these people don 't know how to react , brother .
maybe that 'll be the thing that kills you .
we got a problem .
and with that condor down at the bottom of the canyon ,
and in five hours and change , that sun is coming up ,
there 's still the tug .
and there are nine of us
that 's a given .
that favol survived the fall
now we go down to the condor ,
two hours down , two hours to the tug
jlifeboat rules
that 's a dangerous game you 're playing
must not be carbon-based life .
halo ring ? i don 't put anything past it .
they 're baiting us .
yeah , they 're too close , and we 're going nowhere with him .
i 'm tired of listening to you .
you 'd take that chance ?
you got one more second , locke .
doesn 't have to be like this .
i 'm not the one who needs saving
you know where i stand .
might be all you have to make , macer .
he 'll turn on you , huh ?
the least essential one always dies .
you 're telling me this why ?
so you could teach me ?
football .
if you want to blend in with penny 's friends ,

by the chinese air force .
dr. henning .
scared for myself and my family .

i think we can all be forgiven for a little youthful exuberance
what 's this cover for ?
it 's naturally clear ,
yes , we want machines that can manage a three-block war
eventually it will look and
and it will look pakistani or chinese or .
it 's incredible

we have to let him go eventually .
i wouldn 't let him . i would stop him .
i would shout at him .
go on . try .
you could hurt him .
i want to believe .
if you asked me to trust you , i would .
yes ?
oh . right . when does she go into surgery ?
but he 's a lying bastard . it 's just a backup to it 's g.p.s .
because the bomb doesn 't work without it .
shut down the base . kill the machine and vincent on sight .
the soldiers can speak
their words are evolved , efficient .
because they are part of the new world ,
to save my daughter 's program .
come on , we 're in the middle of a great story .
it 's time to 20 to bed .

and this is as much as i need to move a mountain ?
but it 's up to him .
for centuries , people believed that if you do this list ,
" feed the hungry ,

so , were you nice to him ?

okaywell , since i 'm obviously being ignored here , let 's go over the morning schedule .
my mother lives with me .
christy will stay with howard penny can go back to her apartment ,
if you had let me invite penny then you would have had your fourth .
she uses a fork and she double-dips her egg rolls .
exactly , but we 'd have to if she was here !
not only are there children starving in india ,
you 're nice boys .
i 'm going to bring you the four dumplings .
no one has to know .
how about soup ?
yes , but you didn 't portray her as completely irrational .
but good luck .
no . i 'm pretty sure my anger is with you .
who are you calling ?
hi , this is howard wolowitz .
i 'm terribly sorry . oh .
i 'm sorry . i-i was racing a horse and cart .
at least , uh , he 's alive and kicking .
i mean to pay my fare .
whooping cough .
goodness .
he 's a club patient .
how 's betty ?
miracle cure .
one of your plaster acorns .
i don 't know what came over me .
oh , no , but roddie and i
like a man stealing a lock of hair
did she make you own up ?
she burned it in the grate .
well , you 're forgiven now .
it is queer , isn 't it ?
there was a child here then .
susan died before i was born .
i hardly think dr. faraday would approve of that .
and it hasn 't done him any harm .
i 've just seen rod in lidcote .
i 'm concerned about his state of mind .
last night he came up to my room so upset .
war shock .
the land sale 's already too much to bear .
god knows how she 'll cope
well , they wouldn 't take the pasture .
they 'd only take the grass-snake field .
there must be some alternative .
who the fucking hell are you ?
and it isn 't any business of yours !
you 're not part of this family .
every day like clockwork .
i 've promised dr. faraday the tour .
so , uh .. a lounge .
hey ! hey !
good dancer , caroline ayres .
pity she hasn 't the looks to match .
girl like that needs an outlet .
everyone knows how much time you 've been spending out there .
i 'm telling you , faraday , make your move tonight before
seeley , i heard you were here .
now , you promised me ..
god 's sake .
so did i. i can 't .
caroline , please , caroline , wait .
there was no pain associated with the procedure ,
yes , we 've got some really interesting work here .
i 'm flattered they asked , but ..
up in birmingham . stayed on there for a while .
must have been busy .
i 've missed you like hell .
i shouldn 't have left you .
you perfect child .
yes , well , it 's too many night calls .
are you finished for the day ?
this business seems almost contagious .
one time there was this fashion for fainting .
that 's just it .
caroline has begun to believe
and it 's madness , i know , but ..
what exactly are you saying ?
you 're suggesting
become mischievous or malign .
isn 't that the old theory
then there isn 't an ounce of science in it .
well , she can 't be allowed to remain all alone
she has me .
get caroline out .
it 's all right .
we had such fun here in the old days .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
how would she know i 'm gay ?
cam has this crazy theory that if he were straight ..
they 'd be dating .
i met her once at an a.i.d.s. walk ,
and her fingers lingered .
i could totally pick up any woman in here .
thank you . nice to meet you .
bye !
seriously ? you got her number ?
should you be using screws instead of nails ?
so was that gazebo you built for our 4th of july party .
you know what can 't climb trees ?

i don 't understand .

mom , just tell me .
i 'm a bad man .
mitchell , remember the girl i met last night ?
she 's super famous for having the world 's worst gay-dar .
you know , we had a real connection .
i don 't think you understand how charmed she was by me .
i won cutest baby at the 1974 jasper county fair .
you know what ? i 'm calling her .
no , i can 't carry this around .
i was hoping i would call , too .
so listen , i forgot to mention something last night ,
um , it 's actually somewhat delicate .
no , no , i had a great time with you , too , katie .

close ? close to what , maggie ?
what do you think we should do ?
you know , karen ,
the task that we have set before us
devotion ? no .
one must have direct experience

a tale of woe , perhaps ?
dennis kim 's 15 years old , and he 's already correcting my work .

" pretty sure " is not very scientific .
i just came by to say hello .

the effort to develop a strong artificial intelligence .
but while some focus on the still-distant dream of a thinking computer
my priority is to use my colleagues ' accidental insights ..
and in the hopes of finding a cure fer alzheimer 's .
" a new type of thinking is essential
not merely to cure disease , but to end poverty and hunger .
and build a better future for all o / us
than our next speaker . but then again , i 'm probably biased .
thank you very much .
that 's a difficult question , dr. tagger .
you can 't program a machine to be self-aware .
that is your opinion . you just happen to be wrong
if we missed anything . anything . a thought , a childhood memory
we should be focusing our efforts on nanotechnology . synthetic blood cells .
we can save him .
even though i know i 'm a dead man .
in life is the oss .

the possibility of that end
it was like waking from a dream .
didn 't think i could be like this .

he can 't see or hear . i 'm reconnecting him .

holly spent the last 12 years
whatever she wants , she gets ,

and that 's a bad thing because .. ?
okay , how do i say this nicely ?
how about this ? tonight , you get messed up .
what party ?
uh , well , off the top of my head , um ...
im ...

can i talk to you in private ?
well ...
are you kidding me ?
i realize that my ..
did you create a facebook page for maya ?
yes .
but it wasn 't just facebook .
this is a work of art .
nice and high , so i can count .
calling it " moms " is sexist against men .
you 're a little stupid , aren 't you ?
yeah . yeah , i 'll be happy if we make the tournament , but .
they don 't have the best assistant coach in the country .
perfect .
i just , i can 't believe you said yes .

thank you . that actually worked out great .
well , ron is one of the reasons i hate this job sometimes .
honestly ?
should have kept my big mouth shut .
took a run at it a few years ago .
if you don 't mind helping me search for it ,
yeah , well , it 's the least i can do for you making ron look like a dick .
but it was just a series of dead ends , so i sort of gave uo .
that was a good decision .
oh , my god .
you know , the adoption agency advised me not to .
but i was .... . 16 .
but i knew you had to be born .
i found my old research !
well , i took out the really good stuff ,

how many times i still thought about her every day .
i 'm a mess . and , you know what , i hate the lie .
i could lose her again .
you act like you don 't have a choice .
well ...
because she was pretty amazing .
hey. don 't be a stranger , huh ?
but it comes with a price .
oh , just give me that .
to make all three products entirely green from the tangerine extract ,
change often comes at a cost .
well , maybe you could ask them for more time .
what you said we could .
oh , look who 's back from the city .

nine weeks of work and i ..
everything happens for a reason , right .
there 's just .
oh , tell me about it .

you were always good enough .
you 're the only one that ever doubted it .
that ? now ?

well , how can i trust anything you say ?
i got my wish .
but i realized something .
ts a cute deal .
if we 'd only done it differently .
i mean ,
two of them left me .
and all of this i could bear as long as i had my girlfriends .
everything i touch ..
well , on that note , i think i 'll call it a night .
you don 't have to rub it in , lynette .
wait . i 've got an idea .
well , i 'm sure you can fix that .
but they all seem to hate me .
jimmy , we 're only doing this because we love you .

oh , chloe , look ,
they left an hour ago .
i got it , ms. schoenfield .

my housewife just got even more interesting .
just trying to make your life miserable .
i 'm tracking down a missing person .

gaby , please .
oh , my god ! you brought it .
oh , well , that never works .

me ? what do you mean ?
that 's the sauce my mother uses .
interesting .
i 'm hungry now .
why don 't you give me an hour and come over ?
i don 't have hot dogs .
i was talking with penny .
you can 't hang out with your roommate 's ex .
no , it 's fine . i don 't care .
yeah , he 's over it ; that 's why he 's been whining all day
it 's not like i have to moderate my food intake
nah , i can 't . i got to pick up my mom from her water aerobics class .
looks like the manatee tank at sea world .
how could you get lost ? your phone has gps .
there are no solar flares right now .
what the hell was that about ?
do you think this is really hillary clinton doing it with oprah ?
leonard .
thanks for seeing me on such short notice .
maybe this isn 't a good time .
okay , you can take him for shoes .
well , all i know is he says they hurt his feet .
well , he heard me making plans on the phone ..
all right .
i don 't want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste .
and the more cards you see ..
they 're taking us home tomorrow on a plane .
how are we doing here ?
keeping him updated .
he doesn 't need that kind of pressure right now .
they 're coming back .
they 're gonna be fine .
how long are we saying that this is okay ?
i , for one , find it refreshing .
she never has anything nice to say .
i said no more damn restraints !
she doesn 't even belong on this floor .
she belongs up in psych .
don 't tell me where she belongs .
okay .
it 's time to get up .
and you 're gonna go slack-jawed and cuckoo 's nest .
cristina , please , i am begging you . please .
cristina , please .
say something , please .
you need to dissect the two draining veins clear
well , that 's much sexier , isn 't it ?
thanks , shepherd . i 'd be happy to have you join me ..
i , um ... probably have a class to teach .
she 's right .
great .
yeah . she just freed the first draining vein .
there 's bleeding on the sinus .
bad things happen . it 's hard .
oh , god love you , mer .

george died here .
i mean , now you sound like the same scary loner bitch
well , you know , a part of me wishes it hadn 't .
and you should not look back . go .
no , you know , cristina , you 're right . i 'm not your person .
your person is you , and it always has been .
hold my hand .
usually when i talk to him , i sense that he 's there ,
that 's not gonna happen tonight .
if he starts going south , i 'll tell him to cut it out .
thank you .
don 't make me look like an ass .
a lot of people counting on you .
is he okay ? did he code ?
oh , god . where the hell is shepherd ?
torres .
pretty amazing recovery , right ?
yeah , b.p. is 110 over 60 .
it 's fine .
well , i know you do , but you 're wrong .
and that is definitely not how i talk to patient .
we 're in the business
she 's a person on the precipice of change , avery .
god , the things we worry about .
and we get to help take that worry away .
it 's actually why we 're people ,
we control that , avery
and i didn 't like myself for it ,
i only went on that plane because i was pissed at you .
i 'm only here because he 's so selfish and thoughtless .
so now ...
why this would happen to someone like me ,
would you get out of my room ,
hey . we just had lunch ,
you need to take her to the park more .
she 's indoors all day .
what do they want ?
octavia gallery by 1 : 00 p.m. or they cut her open .
it 'll be tight . it 's lunchtime .
we can expect heavy foot traffic .
snipers ? we don 't need snipers . i 've got the cash .
you tailing him ?
do not turn around .
wait for them to approach you , mr. denning .
i don 't even know
nothing is gonna happen . we 're just ..
i don 't think so , ben .
it 's a disaster .
how did you build your reputation ?
you know , i do the wrong thing for the right reasons
reputation , mr. cahill , is an idle impression ,
can you handle it ?
what 's gonna really bog us down now ,
the state of louisiana from 1979 till now
my profound ignorance uncovered something .
and now he 's hanging you out to dry .
go ahead , motherfucker !

i 'm unusually sensitive down there .
plus it 's the fear of pain
of course i 'm afraid of stuff .
look ..
for practical matters ? well , that wasn 't true .
give me a break . that 's not a thing .
everyone would rather have a boy .
oh ! you 're running out of arms , mom !

some major breaking news now here on ukn .
there 's no comment at this time .

and if they don 't find her ?
they 're surrounding the place now .

algorithm .
i ran a nationwide traceback on uninterrupted one-way uploads
looks like it had lights on .
alert the local team . we 'll head out now .
with helmet-cam relay . we can watch the operation .

we 've done all we can .
i 'm sorry , michael ...
mike , it 's 20 past three . we 're out of time .
it 's not going to happen .
to the public , this would be one man , to be blunt , of questionable popularity
if she isn 't , he 'll kill her and upload the video .
the mood will border on insurrection and you will be destroyed ,
the public , the palace and the party insist on compliance .
refuse , and i 've been advised
but ...
and now appears to be heading west to bankside studios .
after midnight , it 'll be a criminal offence
... when public opinion has very much hardened ,
... an unprecedented nature .
in a few minutes ,
recording or possessing
the broadcast will commence after the following tone .
so you 'll have to keep going .
well , not for another ten years when we 're still single .
i mean , it 's one thing for you , me ,
i hate that tour guy too !
it took us five years ,
can you believe he 's telling his entire tour

your mother was a good catholic and everything ,
i don 't use the phone while i 'm driving .
please call me .
can you believe these girls ?
by being late for an appointment .
i bet they like evian in fallujah .
they do prefer the flat .
junior , i don 't think you have one ounce of wiggle room
i don 't ask , they don 't tell
and what would make you think that " unknown " is a miss ?
hello ?
that depends who this is .
i don 't do business over the phone .
how will i know who you are ?
i have a lot of people who work for me .
of course not . though what i can 't quite figure
that is what the hotel is saying
you 're a quick study .
once the deal is made , the deal never changes .
the deal is for one passenger .
any packages ?
weight ?
is that a problem ? i was told that you can transport anything
it 's me . he left . you can proceed
no , it 's just that it 's a chateau cheval blanc from the 2005 vintage .
but it 's 200 euros
hello , junior .
couple of things i need to take care of .
yeah , i 'm sorry .
that sounds like a good plan .
may i be of some assistance ?
do you mind holding that ?
expensive taste .
what 's going on ?
no . i told you once i set the deal , the deal doesn 't change .
gina , 49 kilos , qiao , 55 kilos . 104 in all .
out of the car . all of you . now .
you think this is the first time someone 's held a gun to my head ?
but it 's gonna be the first time someone uses it .
anna , there 's a cop .
just show it to him already .
no good deed goes unpunished .
window !
over the window .
but as you will see , i was coerced .
with both sets , she could open the security box by herself
voila
he picked the one girl up ,
it was set fire to , but they were already gone .
well , i 've been sucker punched a lot in my time ,
how many more of you are there ?
bhe is estonian. rom tallinn
that 's great , dad .
wanna make a new deal .
you haven 't heard the terms yet .
they 're really very simple .
i wouldn 't do that if i were you . that touches your skin ,
soup to nuts , it will kill a man in 12 hours .
you could do that , but you 'd be killing your father along with us .
you don 't , he dies .
did i ever lie to you ?
i got all the girls that most fit the description on the video .
they love their oeccitan .
i know the basoue country well .
was a big aerospace industry tucked in all around there .
get undressed
are you asking me or telling me ?
in the three musketeers , there were really four .
no . no , i don 't think that 's it .
maybe we 're smarter than the three musketeers .
we 're gonna find out . all right . let 's try .
okay , hold on .
let 's get the hell out of here .
do you have any idea how to get us out of here ?
no , no , it 's the main cargo hatch .
climb in the back
what do you mean , jump ?
junior !
it 's really bad !
it 's not working , we need a doctor .
tower to air star 669 , you are going to crash .
i repeat , you are going to crash .
wake up !
it 's the trigger on your right .
do it now !
there 's nothing in his beer . we made it up .
not from poison .
look , the bullet is still in there .
all right , we 've wasted enough time getting here already .
no . no , we can 't just let her die .
okay , no doctors . let 's help her ourselves .
can you get something to raise her leg up , please .
okay .
all right . take the rod off one of those clothes racks
see how many cobwebs you can get on there .
put some pressure on that , would you , junior ?
no one 's dying today .
how did this happen ?
it 's some kind of medical grade anesthetic .
one part i can 't quite figure out though is
well
i 'm sorry i lied to you about the poison .
i 'm sorry about that , too .
very wrong
i think i have a good idea .
how did you get caught up in all of this ?
drinking and drugs killed the people that guns didn 't .
i think she could have gotten $ 600 , right ?
you can still walk away .
do you know what it feels like to be thought of as trash ?
without thinking about it .
really ?
the only thing different between this year and last
is this where we get our hand stamped ?
uh , why-why are you here ?
let 's go get our seats .
yeah , yeah . i-i get that .
plus , once people know they 're here ,
wait .
aren 't you worried about stalkers ?
most of my followers
he just posted that .
hey , rainer shine .

if she 's uncomfortable , it 's our duty to protect her .
well , it is intimacy like that
excuse me , what boundaries ?
you told her we have boundaries ?
okay , i feel like this tea 's getting away from us .
get !
hey , this isn 't the way to work .
i thought stuart was looking after her .
and honestly , i 'm kind of glad .
how so ?
she feeds him out of her own mouth ?
and believe me , when food goes in that mouth ,
first of all , no one can replace me as a son .
i have an insulin pump .
a grown man in his 30s living with my mother .
he needs a place to stay .
and even if there was , who cares ?
" who cares " ? ! you wouldn 't care
i give you my blessing .
i 'm just gonna call my mother and be honest with her .

well , that doesn 't make any sense .
oh , you need to relax . this whole uptight thing ?
hey .

those kidneys aren 't going anywhere on their own .
we 'll only be gone 45 minutes . they 'll keep .

the only reason a woman does something like this to her body
and then she 's single , dyeing her hair a new color .

karikala kattappa nadaar .
he can help us if he wants to .
kattappa is a slave the throne of mahishmati .
a sword trader , sheik aslam khan from kabul
purified in the furnaces of the golan mountains .

felicity and glory reigns supreme here .
may the glory of mahishmathi soar sky high .

he must have realized we are his foster parents .
i know shiva will rescue queen devasena . come with me .
mahasena !
i am nothing , but a living dead .
it felt like it was his statue that was being erected !
or did they see someone ?
let us question the soldiers on duty ...

i saw him , my lord !
and yet they look at me like am their god !
i have never met before ,
you are the son of our savior amarendra baahubali
this kingdom of mahishmati was established
but bijjaladeva blamed it only on his physical disabilities
he was survived by his subjects
the king 's sister-in-law and bijaladeva 's wife , sivagami
so , i will take the throne and restore it to its former glory !
you all swore a solemn oath to be loyal to this throne .
being a leader is the first tenet
all those who support this royal family step to one side .
kattapp ? !
vash it off with their blood !
while our people are being hacked to death ?
kill kattappa !
it belongs to my son , bhallaladeva .
both my sons have a right to the throne .
this is my word and my word is the aw !
may you live long , my dear baahubal .
now has risen the sword that will condemn .
is enemies remain astonished

when i become the king , you will be my commander !
they stand as equals .
god has blessed both my children with equal strengths .
make their next challenges much more difficult .

the kalakeyas don 't believe in tactical attack .
if they barge into the kingdom
we have a standing army of 25,000 soldiers .
how big is the kalakeya army ?
when wild bulls barge into the crops
according to our sources ,
will repel that kind of attack for three hours .
their army , without a chief , will scatter !
it will take them at east three hors
hail mahishmati !
all mahishmati ! hail mahishmati !

i was wondering if , perhaps , you could remove rex 's name from that little book ?
those muffins better be really good .
it can be all yours , if you just ..
continue to be discreet .
i don 't think it 's asking that much .
we have the upper hand . without us , they have nothing .
waiting for us to take any crumb they 're willing to throw our way .
hi . um , i 'm gonna be spending the whole night with her ,

yeah , i 'll bet . what did my dad say ?

when things calm down ,
and i appreciate that .
and i 'm just looking out for your best interests .

it makes a kind of x .
if i can get dirt in there with some of the newer firepower ...
everything 's been worked out so the image hits the right spot .
what if your math is wrong ?

alex , i 'm so glad you joined us .
is where we 're going to find our next cardholder .
if you were having a secret meeting .
you 'd send the where and the when separately as a precaution .
within a few seconds of the london mail .

i mean , these servers ..
you want those e-mails , i 'm sorry .

guards checked her out at 3 p.m .
we have phone records .
her son-of-a-congressman fiance went with her .
when gia left , she simply left a door or a window open for luke .
were always fighting about her partying
i know how painfully boring these rich kids ' lives are .
something terrible happened on carrie 's dad 's boat nine years ago .
no anchor . they used it to weigh the body down .
maybe she 's friends with martina vascuez ?
hey .
america thinks he 's guilty , and that 's good enough for me .
hey .
there 's just so much going on here right now .
sure you could .
could you maybe try and understand why i chose not to ?
that 's why i think it 's time for us to just ..
wait , no , that 's not what this is .
veronica , i 'm standing outside of a hotel with my parents ..
so that loyalty , or friendship
i gotta go let my mom off the hook , okay ?
please be nice .
apparently , they left several on your cell but never heard back .
no need . they said they 're moving on without you .
the gist was they wanted someone who cared enough to return a call .
and just like that .
for what ?
all right . bye .
deputy .
a few weeks ago , keith . it 's a funny video .
have you seen luke pick up ?
apparently , he had to make a pit stop for some hot man-on-man action .
hold on . someone 's at her door .
it 's cobb
why ? does she need someone to empty her cat box ?
i mean , there are beards and then there are beards that go the extra mile .
gia , keep up .
i believe you .
she disappears below deck .
but cobb says that she 'd sleep it off
i 'm delicate .
i can beat an awol rap .
what 's 180 days to us ?
lives ruined , bloodshed .
two solid weeks of bliss , and now it 's back to the real world
but sometimes it kills us in the transitions ..
veronica !
i 'm supposed to find the courage to change the things i can .
shit .
how does it feel getting out ?
how you doing , squeeb ? how you feeling ?
oh , a little going away present .
don 't eat anything on the right side of the fridge . it belongs to hawk .
if you put milk in it , you might as well use milk .
unofficial sources have described it as an execution-style killing .
holy shit .
jesus christ . somebody killed boylan ?
police are being tight-lipped on the case so far ,
you wanna guess who that could be ?
first rule in this class is to take everything you 've learned
you need to be awake ,
and nowadays , there are all these cameras everywhere .
now let 's get to today 's lesson , okay ?
hey , spenser .
looks like it 's , uh , west of the tropicana .
i 'm telling you , it 's a waste of time .
i don 't even think you have $ 100 .
" she is most sincerely dead . "
any of you curious kittens think to call 911 ?
i got a 419 .
hey , man ! hey , hey !

i had a show the other night
it started at a , uh , strip club .
it 's called crazy ponies .
i remember her high-beams .
oh , man ! couple guys there , too .
after that , it was lights out .
uh , they were two ,
to think the topper was in danger .
it 's a shame only the good die young , isn 't it ?
you don 't need a lawyer , topper .
it 's the cloak .
all i 'm saying is that your trace
two nights ago , i was on a bathroom break .
right up here .
i go to the gym , work out .
you ever hear of an atm ?
bank traced amber 's $ 5,000
the last cash deposit was for $ 1,200 .
yes , ma 'am .
i had to order a piece . should be in tomorrow .
oh , good . thank you .
no , ma 'am .
i may drop in later , though ,
the frost blenders are really good .
you 'll have a lot of choices .
i 'll have a chunks combo meal , the six-piece .
you don 't have pickles ?
i know that frost blender did not just try and mess up my nail . tcch .
i know . i need to set it normal .
i know , right ? they change it ,
you know , i just watch tv , and it , like , ruins my days off .
i could see that .
yo , they wasting my days off and shit .
don 't worry about it .
i could take your order ?
becky , i 've got the police here on the phone
they 're saying you took it out of a woman 's purse .
not our standard khakis .
officer , i 've checked her pockets , and there 's nothing in them ,
do you have a purse ? you have a purse ?
um , it wouldn 't be here in the office .
there 's no one ..
if you 're just straight with me , it 'll all be worked out , okay ?
okay , so what that tells me is that you don 't realize
yes , sir .
now , first we need to find the money .
i don 't have any money .
well , why are there people who say otherwise ?
you don 't know .
you don 't know ! huh ! okay .
oh , i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry .
but my brother doesn 't even do anything . this is crazy .
okay'
if you do this , you will build our case . you understand ?
we don 't have no pickles either .
i 'm on the register by myself .
let me just finish this real quick .
you think he could be wrapped up in the same stuff becky is ?
but he gives you hell , huh ?
ha ha ! i 'm sorry . it must be a real pain .
oh , you know , i don 't ... hmm .
you know , the last thing i need ... i may have mentioned it .
you know what i mean ?
i 'm sorry .
right .
yeah , maybe you 're right .
what 's it like to have a front-row seat to the show ?
how 's everybody doing in here ?
what ?
i don 't know .
let me talk to him . give me the phone .
oh , great . how you doing ? you busy out there ?
it 's a great night . uh ...
why are you talking to me ?
i have to get back out there to the restaurant .
oh , good . so i 'm gonna give him back the phone .
i 'll see you when you come .
sandra , please , i can 't do this .
they can 't make me do this .
you 're gonna be fine .
hey , van ...
i .. i guess so .
listen , i 'm not sure when you guys are coming .
she just left .
well , you gotta get on that .
i need you to give her a spanking ' cause she was talking smack to sandra ,
you mean ...
... actually do that ?
he wants to talk to you .
didn 't we talk about you going easy on sandra ?
yes , sir .
do you even understand how hard this is on me ?
no . i don 't . nobody does .
robbie ? hey , it 's sandra .
yes , sir . i 'm calling about that theft situation .
um , my employee that stole .
the police ? what happened ? i-i 've been sick all day .
you haven 't been talking to officer daniels on the other line ?
you 're the first person i 've talked to .
should . should i come in ?
who are you ?
ha ! i 'm just kidding , sandra . it 's me .
wait . he hung up ?
i ... i did what i think , um , anybody would do ,
someone who said they were the police .
well , what he said was that he was investigating from her house .
you know , " when are you coming ? " i asked many times .
um , yeah , well ...
and everything about it was strange to me ,
before you went to japan , i saw you writing that story .
well , so i borrowed mum 's key and went into your study ,
a man comes to baker suree
" the cane shows the marks of a dog 's teeth .
he wears a wedding ring ?
this sentence , to be exact .
not expensive clothes .
that 's how you knew it was about the wife .
when you 're a detective and a man comes to visit you ..
so why did you stop where you did ?
i told watson , if i ever write a story myself ,
but i 'm trying to do so now .
" so you 've come about your wife . "
i 'll see you after lunch .
so you found the right address .
my father 's most prized possession .
i had it brought to the house
soon ann asked me if she could
mr. holmes , my ann has changed .
one day i was outside the room
don 't you know ?
where are you off to ?
you 'll eat your breakfast first !
she says there 's a couple in portsmouth
why would we want to live in portsmouth ?
why not ?
well , yes , but it would 've pleased her .
well , i 'm not sure that 's true .
flay the part as he 'd fashioned it ,
so , dr. watson 's imagination changed you ?
i prefer facts .
it was designed as a miniature .
the stones represent the lives of those he has lost .
i mean , do you mourn them ?
death , grieving , mourning
i dwell on logic .
his club , the diogenes ,
they were as john always described them ,
the story was familiar ,
it 's strange to see a semblance of one 's self 40 feet high
whatever do you mean ?
and played
with what means have t ?
all i knew for certain was that the case was my last
get it right before i die .
i 'm 93 .
well , i didn 't actually know him .
mum ! mum !
was it the smoke knocked him out ?
most likely he stood up too quickly
well , now we can 't leave .
he 'll get better !
is that clear ?
it 's from mr. umezaki .
no . wanted to .
mum says you throw out most of the letters you get .
the people who write want you to solve things .
oh , no . you give me too much credit .
perhaps mr. umezaki 's asking you to go back to japan .
why not ?
well . if you need suspects , you know where to find me .
i bet if we asked , mr. holmes would .. do his thing
let 's not bother mr. holmes with any foolishness .
no , that won 't be necessary .
you 've been away most of the day .
in fortsmouth , you met the couple who run the hotel .
they made you an offer , you accepted
you complain enough about it ! always going on about how hard things are .
she can barely read !
mechanic in a garage , like his dad before him .
i 'm gonna put in for the raf ' "
all his mates who worked the motor pool came home without a scratch .
don 't say everything you think .
couldn 't have . the one in the corner .
oh , that 's not my desk , it 's john 's .
i know you say dr. watson didn 't always get things right ,
and the german lady . and that glove .
no , that 's not possible .
well , then why was it in there ?
if you can 't remember , then why couldn 't the case have been a success
i chose exile for my punishment , but what was it for ?
they 're all commonplace .
the dead are not so very far away .
now , whenever did you say that ?
my husband could never succeed at deception
even before i glimpsed you today ,
all these predicted your antipathy .
forging his signature ,
but for two errors .
was that the second error
the man at the station .
stonemason .
the money was to pay for the headstones
i was certain he wasn 't .
you mustn 't do that !
he may never wake .
you didn 't even have the decency
no ! i care about roger .
the bees . didn 't do it .
roger was trying to find out what was killing the bees .
he had to stop them wiping out the bees .
ie tried to drown them with water from his can .
bees leave their stings . wasps don 't .
and when they attacked , he dropped the watering can
a quarter of an hour 's conversation .
she needed so desperately to be understood by someone
they like punchy
'm an artist .
hat ?
my sweet and talented wife !
sweet and talented indeed .
you 've gone and turned her stomach upside down .
and before i knew it
but as the ground came up to meet me ,
and when i awoke
sorry , dr. goodtime ,
i don 't mean to rush you
we can only take what 's useful .
but this one 's a good one .
skills in the theatre ..
i 'm telling you , it won 't do a thing right !
they 're mighty delicate .
you 're of simple mind .
but the simple pleasure is
oh , yes .
when things tilt off in a way they shouldn 't
and i say this line , i just look at him like , " i 'm so sorry . "
i remember simon being very nervous to do his impersonation .
i suppose that could be considered offensive .
wow ! you look like a pile of swans .
amy do you take sheldon for your lawful wedded husband ?
and , sheldon , same thing .
i was very excited by ...
what ? no , nothing .
is that the auction catalog
what is this thing doing here ?
i do ..
how nice is this ?
we just came from lunch at rainbow room ,
yah , i want to be covered in gold .
let 's see . if i was a loving cup ,
how much do you think is in there ?
so i could have $ 60,000 in an hour ?
did i say i ? how weird .
wow , you 're getting everything .
aren 't we , miss pickle ?
oh , i 'm max , and this is my friend katie holmes .
but i just have to say : well done !
oh , you have your own shop ?
is that you and miss pickle ?
next item for auction :
yes , you do !
yolo !
how much do you think this is going to go for ?
no real value ? please .
i jumped 14 hurdles in the rain with walking pneumonia .
yeah , ' cause it has money. in it .

i think you 're hearing me wrong .
you , me , chestnut , jet skis .
three. all outgoing .
not that i 'm complaining .
don 't screw this up , all right ?
you were in imminent danger .
where was she when my brother was strapped
or she wasn 't alive , hasn 't been for 25 years ,
oh , my god !
i. they fight a lot ,
he took something that belongs to me .
i just need a smoke so bad .
what ?
this is the chick who set me up .
busting up clubs , firing shots in public .
i don 't plan on staying here very long. you ?
no alliances form against him .
he 's probably gone ,
do you want to know what i think they were talking about ?
and it pertains to buildings , structures .
what , that the ends justify the means ?
did you know that she had an almost identical quote
you 've done a lot of homework .
let me guess. you two had some kind of moment
well enough to know you 've got the same brilliant mind
she was just
if the truth is that the company is all about saving the world ,
but two ...
absolutely .
you 've clearly thought of everything .
if i weren 't telling you the truth ,
this is a waste of time .
all right , we need to make a shift .
keep it in your pants .
all right , all in favor of changing the regime , say " aye . "
good , great. send it .
you know , i 'm thinking more and more that this is an inside job .
nothing. old address books , photographs ,
there 's nothing from our guy .
because this is starting to feel like a wasted trip .
a couple hours .
uh-oh , looks like there 's been a recount .
no , perfect .
bring her back .
you know , three of the four
time for a ... a family reunion in wyoming ?
don 't tell me it 's something you haven 't wished for .
these pictures could have been taken anywhere at any time .
you 'd bring a bouquet of blue irises .
i said stop it .
she watched you do this every year .
she wants to make amends .
you are the company. you 're his daughter .
of course ido .
what are they doing to him ?
they 're carving out his personality .
or you 're setting me up .
at least not for me .
out .
not to offend either of you , but i took
but i think we 're making some real progress , general .
general , we can handle a lone female .
but it 's my experience , that with the one comes many .
your vehicle arrives in 20 minutes .
michael , come out. we need to talk .
company 's running a recognition match right now .

i think we 've got a real shot
i guess that makes us " under-dogs . "
hey , hey . can i get in on that floor bagel ?
who 's there ?

you know , do you want to join me ?
you 'll regret it if you don 't relax a little .
the-this can wait 10 minutes until i get him into the ground , right ?
okay , up on the table for a little stomach massage

ladies and gentlemen , our winner .
congratulations , pirate captain .
thanks , cutlass .
give it here .
no , give it back .
you are a pirate no more !
yes , well , not a ... not a total success .
the best thing about being a pirate isn 't the treasure .

i can 't remember her name . okay .
let 's see what we got here .
building plans better than anybody else .
it 's open .
jane eyre ? don quixote ?
but i really was a maintenance man .
we 're supposed to be quiet , frank .
why are you wearing a space helmet ?
yeah , i know . i know .
jennifer 's just going to love this .
you know what you are ? you 're no fun .
isn 't this something you 're supposed to encourage ?
instead , i 'm at a party with a beautiful woman .
maybe we can just do the casing portion as a research project .
you would have to be very thorough , frank .
okay .
what a maroon .
i do what i 'm programmed to do .
all of those things are in service of my main programme .
the robot ? i didn 't turn the robot on .
this place was a pig sty last night . look at it now .
no , i 'm not going to turn the robot on .
why don 't you clean this up ?
the robot is not your servant , maddy !
okay , i did it ! okay ? i used the robot !
okay , all right . calm down , it 's okay . i 'm sorry .
it 's not you . it 's not you . i need him .
this is my daughter , madison .
and your name again , was what ?
i don 't buy your whole act .
what is this about ?
the computer thinks frank 's a suspect , of course .
i can 't see him pulling a job like this off at his age . sorry .
he did it . he obviously did it .
she 's cranky .
that 's jacked . who is this guy ?
is that what you want ? no .
you want to be so brain-damaged , you can 't form a sentence .
apollo didn 't get hurt , got killed ! people get killed !
you 're better than this .
i 'm gonna be fighting full-time now .
you are your father 's son ..
but it doesn 't mean you have to be him .
listen , you want to be in somebody 's ring ...
the girl said you wanted to talk about something .
training you .
listen , it 's getting kind of late , kid . so i 'm gonna dose up .
who ? apollo ? yeah , he was great .
so how 'd you beat him ?
time takes everybody out , it 's undefeated .
when mickey died , he came and talked to you , right ?
took you to l.a. , trained you ...
i don 't go there.i haven 't been there in a long time .
who won the third fight ?
in boxing ..
.. sacred element of their identity ...
but for the undefeated best pound-for-pound boxer in the world ..
.. with a seven-year prison sentence looming .
i hate letting me family down .
.. in one of his city 's most hallowed sporting temples .
fighting out of the famed delphi boxing academy ...
.. danny " stuntman " wheeler believes he 's the sport 's future .
i 've never lost .
a champion in a dark and extraordinary predicament .
this is 24 / 7 . conlan / wheeler .
no respect , man .
yeah ?
okay . what do you want , donnie ? it 's late .
yeah ? i didn 't know it was that loud .
got you .
you wanna be a philly fighter , is the place to go .
in a lot of ways . maybe it 's in the water , i don 't know ...
what 's up with all these bikes ?
hey ! the gang 's all here !
hey , padman . good to see you .
this guy is so good with the mitts , he 's gonna teach you a lot of stuff .
and stitch , best cut man in philadelphia .
what 's going on ?
pleasure .
and over here is elvis grant . he makes the best gloves in the world .
nice to meet you , man .
he 's gonna make you a pair of gloves so what your hands don 't get so bad ...
.. johnson was the product of creed 's infidelity .
.. but , wilbon , does knowledge of this affair damage apollo creed 's legacy ?
let 's go back for a second . a little history on apollo creed .
end of discussion .
this isn 't gonna be the first , particularly in the boxing world !
but i 'm not gonna say it 's gonna kill his legacy !
well , it 's a form of cancer .
however , we will have to remove the tumor ..
my wife tried that .
.. this is the best plan of action .
forgive him . because there 's nothing you can do about it .
you 're still caught in his shadow .
just leave , man .
bianca !
no , it doesn 't work like that .
but you assaulted the headliner to my show ..
what if i came to your fight acting like an ass ?
nah , i didn 't think so .
yeah , we did good .
but i never meant to let you down .
rocky 's sick .
i ain 't trying to make excuses for anything that i did ..
they want him to start chemo but , you know , he 's too macho to do that .
well , maybe you can talk some sense into him .
yeah , well , give him my love .
look , we both got a lot going on right now ..
ladies and gentlemen , welcome to goodison park .
... where tonight this is the main event .
.. for the light heavyweight championship of the world .
.. ladies and gentlemen ..
in the red corner , wearing the stars and stripes ..
.. the challenger ..
and fighting out of the blue corner , wearing black with blue .
touch gloves .
too bad your daddy ain 't here to fight in them .
you know what to do .
you got this .
" pretty " ricky conlan in the black trunks ..
conlan is significantly taller ..
you can see right away how much more relaxed conlan is . he 's been there before
that kind of nervous energy can wear you out as the fight goes on .
it 's not easy to just jump right into the major leagues like this ..
of course , there aren 't many fighters like conlan .
conlan easily puts distance between them again .
... and backs creed into the ropes .
ref , come on !
and he gets a warning from the referee .
and conlan really made him pay for it .
creed misses and gets hit in return .
come on , baby . what you doing ?
when he leaves it out there , drop that right hook and smash him , okay ?
so round one was a forbidding experience for young adonis creed .
be first !
logic says cree needs to find a way to got inside of conlan 's long arms ...
come on !
you belong in here !
and they sure don 't know what we 've been through .
i want you to protect yourself .
you gotta believe you can do it .
not just on the scorecards but psychologically going forward , jim .
he 's gonna come after you with everything he 's got .
remember that .
creed has proven plenty in this fight he 's taken it , he 's given it back .
for the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world .
you 're not as far behind as you think .
.. get underneath him , and you 'll be able to rip him .
most critics didn 't think creed could make it this far .
yes !
tie him up , for christ 's sake !
.. but now the left eye looks like it 's almost shut .
rock , is he okay ?
stay there , bianca , it 's okay .
i 'm good .
yeah , man , all right ?
i 'm like some kind of downtown hipster party girl .
open it . open it .
that enormous , unsettling , crazy face .
that depends .
we have to do flyers , we 'll do this , we 'll . "
i thought somebody offered him a ride , and he got in the car .
what are you looking at ?
" he 'll resurface , " you know .
they wanted absolutely to know who i was , where do i come from ,
i had to find a way out of that .
i said that i was american .
i didn 't know even what it entailed .
she can 't , she couldn 't do it .
i just gotta go get him and get him back here where he 's safe .
i should have thought of the consequences .
what would be the first thing you 'd do ?
i didn 't sleep for two days before i got on the plane .
you want to see him , hold him , smell him , just get there .
i couldn 't be nicholas barclay because i didn 't know nicholas barclay .
so , er , that was a problem .
didn 't work
and he turned to her and he said ,
and that 's when she became very aggravated , very agitated ,
i didn 't lie about anything to do with nicholas .
darryl ? charlie parker .
all right , if you 'll excuse me , i am off to start
i can 't believe they let him into canada .
where 's your throat cultures ?
hey , sheldon .
i have a question about these maxi pads .
what ?
oh , they 're not my friends .
she 's here , she 's here .
oh , good grief . this isn 't about you .
now , listen .
so pay attention .
oh , i have so many things to tell your biographer .
but then i remembered that i 'd written it on my hand .
well , who wants to stay in a hotel ?
i 'm so glad you understand .
i understand .
they had very little in common ,
if you decide to use them ,
you 'll also find a laminated copy in your welcome packet .
how thoughtful .
you , too .
it 's my backup emergency supply kit .
now , good night .
yes ?
is everything all right ?
me neither .
it 's you .
sure .
really ?
you really make science come alive .
second vocal test .
morning , sheldon .
more than pleasant .
how do you take your coffee ?
'cause , boy , i was up all night .
no , but i was awake all night .
she won 't notice they 're missing ?
no , that 's okay .
and again this morning .
i was up last night .
i didn 't mind .
it involved another person .
how is a japanese love pillow another person ?
aidan , please tell me you 're not
i really , really need a part .
come on , harder , harder ! oh , yeah .
dad , what the hell ?
men have man needs . those man needs need to be met
so , you 're taking things into your own hands , so to speak .
thank you .
that 's the thing .
ah , yes . you 're the actor .
you 'll make new ff ends , okay ? better friends .
what are you gonna teach them ? how to do the acting ?
it 's only till the end of the semester . we 'll be fine .
i figured that out , jerry .
because i have a shit-ton of work to do .

you 're so fucking inappropriate .
whoa . easy , jane fonda .
believe it or not , i don 't want to know about your dick .
hi , jesse .
how come you 're not in school ?
no , we 're jewish .
but i thought jews ran hollywood .
maybe we 're in the wrong tribe or something .
i 'm gonna go to roosevelt for seventh grade .
we 're learning things like supplementary and complimentary angles ,
you go see sting in concert ,
grace , is this triangle complimentary ?
a triangle can 't be complimentary or supplementary .
right . good . good , exactly .
this isn 't fun time .
what ? oh , my god . who told you that ?
ai roker wants to kill tews ?
i 'm pretty sure he 's jewish . we 'll google it .
yes , grace is the teacher for the minute .
okay , you can be . what do you want to teach us ?
don 't say that .
ho , she 's not . no , i 'm not !
you wrote his name all over your notebook ?
yeah , you know what ?
jesse 's gonna put his penis on you !

this .
i am tired of you guys not listening to me .
so you shaved your head ?
your beautiful hair .

what are you talking about ?
i was just innocently playing video games with the boy when .
tucker !
and we got pregnant so young ,
as parents or on earth ?
gracie , wake up , sleepyhead .
we 're going on a field trip .
is grandpa gonna die ?
are we gonna bury him in the backyard with whiskers ?
we 're gonna have to ask grandpa what he wants .
follow me
what are we doing out here ?
i 'll race you to the top .
look it , the little legs are fastest !
what is it ?
the last time i had an epiphany , it was right here .
you know , sometimes in life you can get kinda stuck
am i stuck because grandpa 's dying ?
will grandpa be able to see us when he dies ?
nobody knows what happens when you die .
and some people will tell you with absolute certainty they know .
no . no , i 'm not saying they 're wrong .
because the rest of us , until we
i don 't know any ghost stories . do you ?
all right , you think on it
i could tell you something grandma
nobody 's trying to touch you .
so , i 'll tell you what . i am going to move jerry out of your cubicle
right .
hey , bud , make sure you 're cutting
aren 't you a little old for playing dress-up ?
what brings you to temple , aidan ?
we 'd go out to the woods behind our house
remembering those fantasies for the first time in , like .
what do you think it means ?
do you think
and if you say he works in mysterious ways , i will run out that door .
try not to get caught up in the god who wants you to be kosher ,
why does grandpa have baby jellyfish ?
believe it or not , those are contact lenses .
why ?
i know , but it 's kinda good-weird . i like it .
he did . if you think about it , all those years ,
that 's someone who studies things
i know the albums are fascinating ,
because we don 't want grandpa to be alone in a scary hospital .
so we 're making him all cozy so he 's happy when he meets god ?
this is the little hand that took so long to plaster anything
no , you haven 't been .
but i 'm glad you 're here , mr. bloom .
that 's the last thing i wanna taste , aidan .
wouldn 't it be great if your brother could be there , too ?
you promise me .
captain kirk 's probably turning over in his grave .
sorry , i 'm a bit of an aficionado
can i give you one thought , though ?
what 's wrong ?
he wants to make amends , he wants to make things right .
look , i 've been thinking and .
look , uh , aidan , i gotta go .
we love you .
so fast .
when we were kids , noah and i used to pretend that we were heroes
maybe we 're just the regular people .
hey !
dude ! this is because of you . i got that part
they fucked you up .
gloria , you must be so hot in that .
in columbia , we take death very seriously .
can we lose the veil ?
who is gloria ?
i used to live there , and when i left ,
you walk into court , pay a fine , it 's done .
if i wanna sweat more , i 'll just move my arms .
hey , you .
well , it 's not the worst thing i 've picked up at an airport ,
we 're looking for our next book .
it 's too soon ,
hey , guys ? i made cookies .
hey , kids , your grandma left each of you something .
oh , my god . there 's a letter .
although if grandma wrote it ,
you felt it , too ?
well , it 's so sweet .
and we fell pretty hard for each other .
especially because by then i had , you know ..
i 'm sorry . you 'll have to forgive me .
oh , good . it 's you .
but i will say that i am guilty
you 're innocent , and i can prove it .
and these canceled checks prove
it was well known ,
at that moment , the curtain rose on a parenthetical , domestic drama .
they were in their first condition . it couldn 't be maintained , of course .
but i love it all just the same , this enchanting old ruin .
the grand budapest .
if you 're not merely being polite ,
well , it begins , as it must , with our mutual friend 's predecessor .
it begins , of course , with .
bring the tray to the table . right away , monsieur gustave .
of course , monsieur gustave . pack them in the hat boxes .
come with me . to fucking lutz ?
you 've nothing to fear . you 're always anxious before you travel .
but , truly and honestly ... oh , dear god . what have you done to your fingernails ?
the color is completely wrong . don 't you like it ?
perhaps this will soothe you . what ? don 't recite .
these are not acceptable . i fully agree .
i started my primary school . i almost ..
good morning , cicero . call the goddamn plumber !
tout de suite . she needs me , and i need you to help me with my bags and so on .
do it . and bring a bottle of the fouilly-jouvet ' 26
they 'll be dancing like gypsies .
and , the next thing you know , rigor mortis sets in .
she was dynamite in the sack , by the way .
i 've had older .
more flavorful , or so they say .
well , hello there , chaps .
with pleasure .
i was once considered a great beauty .
franz . i knew it !
he 's making a funny face .
he 's with me
i cross-referenced them myself with the bureau of labor and servitude .
he hasn 't done anything wrong .
never mind , monsieur gustave ! let them proceed !
she 's very well , thank you . i adore her .
my men and i apologize for disturbing you .
you see ? there are still faint glimmers of civilization
where is she , clotilde ? take me to her .
they 've done a marvelous job .
honestly , you look better than you have in years .
oh , you changed it after all . it 's perfect .
a glass of chilled water with no ice , please .
.. and. also . m. serge would like to speak with you privately in his office. please .
i shan 't be long , darling .
i 've never forgotten the look on that man 's face .
i , myself , had never set foot inside a house of this kind in my life .
but , eventually , i came to recognize ,
oh , yes , yes , of course .
i thought i was supposed to be a fucking faggot .
i 'm leaving .
that picture , boy with apple , is priceless . understand ?
they 're going to fight me for the son of a bitch .
i don 't see why not .
blond , smooth . skin as white as that milk .
one of the last in private hands , and unquestionably , the best .
the rest of this shit is worthless junk .
yes . serge .
wrap up ...
what did you want to tell me , before ?
it reminded her of me . it will remind me of her . always .
see the resemblance ?
actually , we should sell it .
plus , something about those lunatic foot-soldiers on the express .
tell them i 'll be right down .
have you ever been questioned by the authorities ?
ah , inspector henckels .
she 's been murdered and you think i did it .
stop !
what happened , my dear zero , is i beat the living shit
you 've got to win their respect .
you 'll meet him , i hope .
they include , essentially , all members of the extended family ,
serge ? i 'm afraid so .
no , i don 't believe it . they put him up to it .
until i walk amongst you again as a free man ,
take extra special care of every little-bitty bit of it
a great and noble house has been placed under your protection .
your devoted monsieur gustave . "
right , well , be that as it may , find him quick and make it snappy .
no ? anyone ?
try it . it 's actually quite warm and nourishing this morning .
we got fake documents , second-hand street clothes ,
his eyes went blank as two stones .
are you ill , mr. moustafa ? i finally asked .
it 's only that i don 't know how to proceed .
you see , i never speak of agatha ,
you see , she saved us .
will you marry me ? yes .
we were each completely on our own in the world ,
a 's a book . i see .
monsieur gustave recommended it . i have a copy of my own as well .
i 'm only interviewing this vision of loveliness on your behalf .
is he flirting with you ?
agatha , my beauty , return to your beloved .
not only was agatha immensely skilled
i believe she was born that way .
i don 't know what it contains , i don 't know what it represents ,
agreed ? not agreed .
can i ask you a question , vilmos ? yes , dmitri ?
who are you working for ? i thought you 're supposed to be our lawyer .
in this particular situation , i represent the deceased .
yeah . a provision for my fees was included in the
not agreed .
did he just throw my cat out the window ?
there 's something i haven 't told you , agatha .
it 's very valuable , maybe five million klubecks , in fact .
xoul steal art
don 't take less than half the retail asking price . also .
i 'm not a fence , if that 's the term .
i said it wrong she willed it to him .
yes , herr mendl
the next morning , herr becker received a peculiar ,
how did you get out there ? shut the fuck up .
it 's you . thank you . thank you , you sweet , kind man .
i suppose you 'd call that a draw .
let me introduce you . pinky , wolf , ludwig , this is the divine zero .
hold it .
take care of yourself , mr. gustave .
which way to the safe house ? i couldn 't find one .
i 'm afraid so . i asked around , but ...
let 's put on our disguises .
his employer 's mother was one of the victims .
you work for the family desgoffe und taxis ?
i 'm aware of his disappearance .
what do you know about that ? nothing .
mendl 's .
we 've no choice . there 's nowhere else to turn .
it 's our only hope . otherwise , i shouldn 't even mention its existence to you .
do you swear ? of course . what is it , in fact ?
how does one come by front-row aisle seats
how does one secure a corner table at chez dominicue on a thursday ?
well , i was until about five minutes ago .
well , through a sewer , as it happens . exactly .
madame d , dead . boy with apple , stolen , by us .
gustave h , at large . what else ?
the plot " thickens , " as they say .
i don 't know .
we found the butler .
our contact convinced him to meet you midday tomorrow
your train departs in four and a half minutes .
you 'll need these for the dining car .
l 'air de panache .
we should give him something as a symbolic gesture .
ive me 25 . yes .
i 've got to hand it to him . jesus christ .
talk to the club-footed sister again , and , this time , be persuasive .
holy fuck !
why are you only noticing now ? i assumed it went to the tax appraiser .
i believe it was removed by monsieur gustave .
you can 't blame someone for their basic lack of moral fiber .
it 's not his fault , is it ? i don 't know . it depends .
that doesn 't mean i 'm not going to throttle the little swamp rat .
with pleasure .
why ?
she admires you as well , monsieur gustave .
that 's a good sign , you know . it means she " gets it . "
ass s o o
i copied it down . it reads as follows ,
" hide-out is vicinity of gabelmeister 's peak stop .
where you headed , mister ?
l 'air de panache .
compliments of herr mendl , for the executive staff .
let 's put him in the duke leopold suite .
he 's checking in a day early . rooms 401-2-3 .
they 'll need more space than that .
agatha !
something 's on the back of the picture .
he anointed me his successor ,
in the end he was even rich .
" dearly beloved , we are gathered together ... "
i was , perhaps , for a time , considered the best lobby boy
this one finally surpassed me .
truly .

how are you , old boy ?
ta 's not so bad .

we 're meeting up after mess . let the other chaps know , will you ?
i 'm guessing you have all gotten to know each other by now .
you 've been selected by myself and lieutenant jeffries
okay , so that 's it .
although the war is coming to an end , it isn 't any less dangerous .
and remember that your lives are more important than a piece of art .

no , he said it .
goddamn .
my family were home builders ...
i wanted a simpler life
you know , james , your french is not good .
we 'll leave in the morning .
there 's a madonna there i used to see when i was young
that one will do just fine .
any news of granger ?

you 'll see to it that his family gets these ?
lieutenant , i told him not to go , but he was hell-bent .
that 's right .
what have you got ?
they might 've stored some pieces there .
it is written by hitler , signed by hitler .
where did they take the art ?
you understand i 'm here to help you ?
they 're looking for artifacts . they want to protect the historic pieces . huh ?
well , we think the ss took the great pieces of art
well , i wasn 't ss . i was a soldier , like you .

when we created footprints on the moon ,
you know , maybe i should go solo .
we have an actual fan .
uh , " i saw you play at the comic book store .

i was passionate about , something creative .
but i was still my own boss , and then ,
what 's the dream ?

danielle , how can you think i don 't care about your feelings ?
when i saw you in that tub , it was the worst moment of my life .
actually ...
you really don 't wanna lose me ?
i already went through thinking i 'd lost andrew .
this is hard for me .
ugh , fine .
thank you very much .
and she calls the cops .... on me .
yeah , that 's what i thought .

you ain 't got to do this .
you were always one step ahead of me .
first rule in prison pat-downs :
you point ? okay . that 's how you wanna do it ?
either way . so if i die , martin 's going
alissa ? shoot her .
god , look at you !
the computer proved i was innocent .

we have no idea what 's waiting for us back there .
general , we 're gonna need you
we should get out of here .
suck it up !
we need to get a handle on this .
cover the stairwell .
names and reports ?
it 's too dangerous .
we 're almost at the finish line .
i never thought you 'd make it this far .
we need to be prepared to go in
fernando .
we 'll buy her a house to grow up in .
we 'll forget everything , call it a day ?
i don 't know what it looks like up there in your ivory tower .
so , i 'm prepared to do absolutely anything
turn .. around , lisa .
that way , i could 've ...
how long you think that 's gonna last ?
i want to speak with my daughter
company agents aren 't just embedded in the fbi
you 'll never see us coming .
want to know what your father really did for the company ?
he killed people who defected from the company .
come on . something 's not right .
she just left .
he 's going to be heading up the convoy .
are you okay ?
no , he 's not .
all right , i 'm going to send an ambulance with the vans .
thank you .
okay , because of what you 've done ,
sir , what are your orders ?
none of us will ever have to look over our shoulders again .
no matter what comes next .
you 'll have the operation and ,
that 's okay . i understand .
yeah . um .. i was watching a movie on the couch .
yeah . i get it , i get it .
but your girlfriend didn 't .
when somebody lowers an unconscious person onto a bed ,
i need a little light .
the plastic sheathing on the calibration screw 's missing .
but if not , then the heat source came from outside the cable ,
looks like somebody splashed it
yeah , technically .
what killed them ?
all right , that 's five deaths on us .
well , if it 's fire , i think i 'm done here ?
it 's too early .
atf coming in on this ?
who , kunz ? the guy 's an asshole .
what about the family ?
we can 't find them yet .
until we find the hunters and we have a solid determination
the dot camera at the intersection
i want these jag-offs off the street instantly , right ?
by the way. who are you ?
like i said , i got plans .
i 'm sorry , what ?
oh , no , we 're friends .
really ?
then you 're led through the ducts .
second iter kept you traveling
a house this old , this loose ?
something trapped you .
hunters have been shifting money around ,
the dod , the da and the feds can 't seem to make up their minds .
nobody 's seen or heard from jan and rod hunter
were they having problems with production ?
out there were redesign requests
fire ?
the techs were doing our first integrated run
thank you .
dod inspectors swarmed the place ,
then cue the wife .
how her husband planned to shop the real one
and then they disappeared .
which i 'm guessing also means she probably told them
it 's possible they killed her before she said anything about working with us .
five kids died in that fire .
not declaring it arson ,
come on . accidental fire , iimagine ,
you know , when i had those two saves ,
that was later .
you ? you 're sitting around drinking , thinking about arson .
what 's wrong with me ? i 'll tell you what 's wrong with me .
i suck at the camaraderie and the storytelling and the whole
corporal , we need to move .
and i need to get her out in 48 hours .

but they couldn 't kill me .
i begged them to take my life but

yeah , yeah , i got it .
yeah , i see him .

unless you had some questions or concerns .
okay . um ...
i 've been cleared for surgery for weeks .
well , now i 'm saying i am .
again , it 's no big deal .
i will be done long before 5 : 00 .
why are you putting this pressure on yourself ?
why ? because this surgeon is 103 .
" hey , retire , old man ,
yeah , well , there 's nothing to learn here .
he 'll never come off bypass .
owen e-mailed me today .
i don 't know why everyone is so worked up about 5 : 00 .
uh , hopkins , fellowship . leaving tonight .
great program .
oh , did he , uh , tell you about our exchange program yet ?
hunt did mention the program , dr. karev .
how does that not fit your agenda ?
i 've already reached out to u.c.l.a .
not here .
welcome back .
i had nothing to do with this .
well , thank you , everyone . thank you very much .
what ?
it 's a beautiful day to save lives .
she might , as long as she doesn 't look up at
probably . i heard her mom was even worse .
that doesn 't give her an excuse
yeah , that little red light ..
now sit up straight .
focus on what you 're doing .
look at that .
it feels so good to finally have my hands
i 'm not saying it because you need to know the procedure .
your brain can 't fully absorb what we 're about to do .
i 'm giving you a little time to catch up .
after i stop his medications ...
sit down .
quiet i say !
with her condition , it 's difficult for other kids in the class ..
looks like , you are more interested in my tics than roll call .
i have tourette syndrome .
when there are some loose connections in our brain ...
you can ask me anything you want to know about my tourette 's .
i 'll tell you ...
dude , these days my rats also make the same noises .
ya ! possibly .
oru 's taught us newton 's law of motion .
now just learn it as an equation .
then why are we wasting our time in school ?
what say pankaj ?
ya ! sorry sir .
madam please .
what 's the big deal about them anyway ? !
it 's not about the prefect badge .
you just need equal opportunities ...
i bet 9a has maids and servants to even wash their bums .
this school and its teachers will never let us become prefects .
yes mr. wadia , please sit down .
how much do you make at that card game ?
8 a month ? sometimes 12 ..
not bad .
don 't pull my leg , ma 'am .
ma 'am , what 's he gonna get from studying ?
he 's already making more than the graduates in our slums ,
who 's asking you to sell detergents ?
not this petty roadside gambling ..
hey killam , do you have sunglasses ?
there 's too much light coming from there man ! i think i 'll go blind .
must be wadia 's wedding gift to his young bride !
" sir , sir , how can i keep my badge shiny and bright ? "
don 't make me say a word more . go back to class !
can you even speak properly ?
i don 't even know if this is a school or a circus .
you should 've slapped him , ms. mathur .
but don 't worry , 9f deserves it .
sir , will you please tell me -
i 'll see you in the principal 's office .
it 's destroyed !
maybe my methods are wrong .
your date 's here . please handle it .
she had a bad day , at school .
that day , on the terrace , when we threw those rockets ..
only the two of us didn 't write anything .
our lives are stuck on that last page .
i 've been teaching for 20 years !
sure , they could 've passed .
and that too only in science and maths ?
sir , they 've worked hard sir .
sir , the answers are right , but there is no working .
how did they get these answers ? no idea .
i know my teaching methods are different ... . out of box even .
there are many ways to get to a solution mr. wadia !
the question papers were leaked ms. mathur .
mother ginger 's the one who began this war .
what do you mean ?
dear queen marie kept mother ginger in line .
i don 't understand .
but that means that mother ginger has it .
then we can 't make the army ..
unless we can bring the key back .
i could go to the fourth realm .
i came here to find that key .
this must be why my mother sent me here .
we were lucky to escape with our lives the last time .
i must get that key .
he 's your favorite , isn 't he ?
you just had to interfere again , didn 't you ?
you merely delayed the inevitable .
where is she ?
she 's fled the realm . she 's safe from you !
and you 're a dirty rascal .
put her on the platform .
sugar plum ...
but this isn 't gonna make you feel any better !
it was you .
father , i 'm so sorry .
this time has been extremely difficult ..
i lost the love of my life , and you lost your mother .
but i don 't want to miss one more minute ..
shall we go home ?
after all , it 's what 's expected of us .
angry birds is a game .
all right , technically it 's a game .
okay , well , anyways , i brought you
oh , no , don 't put me in the middle of this .
come on , help me out .
there 's no reason to worry .
i 'm sure many women
tonight , we take back our dignity ,

yeah , we 're kind of bad-asses , aren 't we ?
hey , how about we stay the night
it has shamu , who is literally tons of fun .
yeah , we 're coming for you . todd zarnecki .
i almost feel sorry for the poor fool ,
you trying to get us killed ?
beyonce ? really ?
i like that .
we are winged fury !
next time we go to kick someone 's ass ,
sheldon , let 's go .
why did you bring that ?
okay , let 's get clear on something .
i 'm not sure i can ...
oh , okay , uh ...
i 'm really not sure i can tonight .
i 'm just a little dizzy and my stomach is ...
yeah , i 'm definitely gonna stay in bed .
i got your e-mail .
we know you have the manuscript , right ?
oh . okay . well , is it watermarked ?
shoot him an e-mail , see if you get a response .
uh , no , i just work in the other building .
i don 't see anything on the books with you , though .
okay . have a seat . there 's a chair over there .
he 's in there . just go in .
i mean , she needs a new focus ,
it 's a gift , all right .
the answer is no .
it 's just a boring lecture .
one more hour of sleep , that 's what it is .
this is jackson 's mother , catherine avery .
yeah . i met her when i was an intern at mercy west .
she is ...
no , she 's not . she 's brilliant .
or they ruin your whole life .

hello ! that 's more like it .
isn 't penile reconstruction
well , i can answer your question with a question .
yes .
if one day , it wasn 't there , wouldn 't you want it back ?
forget it .
this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity .
now get in there and make me proud .
kepner , keep your hand down .
you can 't do that .
their custody was suspended .
it 's a breach of confidentiality .
their custody is under investigation .
it could jeopardize the adoption .
for the love of god .
who wants to take dr. grey 's place ?
yes !
and she 's not , and that 's my fault .
arizona is a great surgeon .
what is your plan on fixing this ?
and enthusiastically .
did i mention that i promised ellis grey ...
i am still not putting that girl on my trial .
you know , i really don 't get you .
what if it was sofia ?
if something happens to her ,
i 'm sorry . i 'm just sayin ' , it sucks .

this is a giant , illegal , fat sack of weed .
see ? his nose and his eyes are red .
well , it 's gonna take me
stop saying " fat sack of weed . "
the pot is in the pot !
maybe this is the universe 's way
max , we are not that desperate .
i 'd rather just see what the holidays bring .
that sucks for you , dude .
she is really getting the hang of that .
you finally called me from an ihop in greenpoint ,
" the mayans were right ! the mayans were right ! "
it was just last night .
you told me all about it when you called at 4 : 00 a.m .
cheers , guys .
thank you .
we sort of have another reason for asking you here .
it could be because of the game
we just don 't know .
and zack 's always admired you
you know , this has been such a nice evening .
aw , you said a thing .
and also really weird , right ?
no , i ...
just because i slept with your wife
you 're welcome .
well , don 't say that to them .
they have to pay me back for my wedding deposits .
i should have ... i should have just trusted her .
fine . then i 'll call her parents
and honestly ..
rajesh , you need to stop being so hard on yourself .
well , i can see how he 'd be flattered to be asked .
well , something can be both flattering and creepy .
really ? so you 'd be okay
yes . we got in a huge fight about it .
what ?
it 's only natural .
well , viewing leonard as a mammal ,
and we hate him .
yeah . so i 'd be helping out a couple who really want a baby .
that doesn 't make any sense .
they wanted you ?
i 'm smart . i 'm nice .
do you want bank balance sheet
you 'd look better if you tie your hair instead of letting it down .
indeed you 're loose ,
priest , we got a huge donation for our project .
okay dear .
which ever couple shares this dish together ...
you feed a spoon of it to me .
you 'll get a good name because of my works .
your dress is very nice !
bye !
okay , come .
dish is excellent !
enough ? let 's meet later .
no way sir .
hello sister-in-law !
what are you doing in office so late ?
no , 7 pm !
does it have to go empty now ?
we 'll not take money from you , father , just bless us .
what happened ?
first time a positive response from her .
blank message is as powerful as blank cheque ,
how am i to tell ?
sir , bindu madam is here .
a fly is irritating me .
get out !
hey thief ! are you here ?
don 't try too much !
who are you talking to bindu ?
you 're smart , you can hide anywhere you want to .
can i tell my sister-in-law that you 're my lover ?
you must become human !
i beg you , buddy ! ensure this meeting goes well !
he has come wearing a helmet .
it 'll be the country 's largest township .
fly repellant ?
am i scared of flies ?
nani is the fly !
we know bindu is an accomplice of the fly !
i 'll take care of it .
if we don 't pay by tomorrow ,
what if one of our partners dies ?
but who would want me dead , bindu ?
do you know who wants me dead ?
hey nani boy ! where are you hiding ? come out !
like every time you sneak in stealthily ...
if not i 'll cut her throat !
you don 't know how i killed him in his previous birth , right ?
i want to feel your life slip away !
you 're finished today !
where are the bullets ?
no sir , door is locked , security men are inside .
there 's no way she can escape .
find her !
after torturing me for 20 long days and suddenly getting caught ,
nani , you 're finished !
it 's not over yet !
pierce it !
oh , you 're gonna ruin the moment , aren 't you ? our best friend , he 's gonna ruin the moment .
hey , you coming to our show tonight ?
oh , no , he can 't . he 's got a new puppy to look after .
i got the call this morning , they need an extra driver .
okay , two passes .
that 's right .
well , what does he know about teaching english ?
and her taste in television programs left something to be desired .
denny never tired of pleasing her .
good boy .
oh , sweet boy , come here .
that 's okay .
i just hoped it would look like me .
we don 't ... we don 't have to fly .
but you have to do this .
if you finish well , all these doors start to open .
when have you known me to be early for anything ?
denny missed it all however , as he was driving through the night at daytona .
you 're doing wonderfully , eve .
i want to talk to denny . can you call him ?
with swift back in the 22 car ,
unbelievable ! denny swift has taken the lead in a magnificent show of skill .
how 's that boy doing , the one who crashed ?
still , you have a daughter now .
i had only one thought ,
i should 've eaten it , even if it killed me .
i promise i 'll never do that again .
come on .
like first in class ?
plus , a permanent seat in the apex prototype .
they want me down in sonoma to start training with the team right away .
i was thinking we could all go on the road ? maybe at least for the summer ?
in racing , your car goes where your eyes go .
denny , please , none of us has the heart to argue about this right now .
maybe it could 've been caught in time .
he can sit for hours on end with no effort .
what 's the deal with the dog ?
of course , she can see enzo .
yeah . from what i understand , enzo wasn 't exactly the ideal house-guest .
it 'd been years since these old eyes had seen a live track .
i even felt the tug of my old dream of driving in a real race car alongside him .
all the students to the grandstand . nobody head home yet .
give me a second .
don , how are you ? good to see you . hello .
this is luca pantoni from ferrari .

i just don 't want you to get in trouble .
it 's fine .
you know , with an imagination like that , i think you should be the writer .

the presentation needs to be visual and we 're gonna mix it up .
we 're gonna run everything through one person .
yeah .
lane has a really great eye for this stuff and i have complete confidence in her .
who happens to look a lot like liam .
even if she 's trying to forget
the lonely night of sad rain
oh , i thought you 'd like that .
lane , i told you not to date liam .
i know you did . i screwed up .
i think i just saw liam .

you won 't be disappointed , sir .
it 's okay . working in investment banking ,
goodbye , tom .
what really happened may not have a happy ending ,
i 've been walking around with the ghost of my magic man .
my anger at liam eventually faded away .

there have been abductions here and here ,
a troll ? trolls are extra .
i mean , correct me if i 'm wrong ,
carter thinks this could be the biggest catastrophe in u.s. history .
i think we 're heading in tomorrow .
the girl is 24 ,

the colonel will understand .
what we 're dealing with could be worse than anything we 've ever seen .
first .
i mean , i just finished hand-picking the best crew to go in
no one 's expendable .
colonel nancy jaax to pathology .
they all have experience with animals .

i called his house a few times .
i know , but we 've been testing ourselves ,
got too many samples coming in .
i promise .
look , i 'll be honest , jerry .
nancy should never have brought carter in .
sure , but getting everybody in that meeting
nancy 's trying to protect people best she can .
and when she puts her mind to something ,
certainly bodily fluids .
so , as far as this operation goes ,
i need to know .
anyone whose suit is compromised once inside
a nail can rip through a suit .

half the men ended up either
" separate thyself from thy enemies ,
let 's rotate. keep everybody fresh .

i didn 't know , i swear .
how 'd it go ?
the one we put in her car .
i don 't know , bro . i 'm sorry .
how it feels to kill a man .
wouldn 't it be poetic justice if we could just
if there was an ounce of it left in this world
they promised us a car , right , babe ?
so can you call someone ?
i don 't see anything . i think we 're really starting strong here .
yeah , yeah .

and to fund his operations ,
what the hell is someone gonna do with a giant worm ?
what can 't you do with it ?
i wouldn 't bother .
sounds like a duck hunt to me .
a decoy . a diversion .
why would they want just this one when they 've got the keys
and we are the cause .
but like all living organisms ,
they are part of the earth 's natural defense system .
but if governments are allowed to contain them , destroy them ,
unless we restore balance .
a dead , charred world , overrun by monsters ?
moscow , london , washington , d.c .
on every continent , the titans are triggering
their behavior has become random .
no . signal 's too weak .

my experience would lead me to say no .
you can 't go through something like that and expect to be who you were .
may i ask , what was the worst of it for you ?
i would concur .
i was there at owl creek

i don 't know .
i 've had such an amazing time with you .
you 're a really creepy dude .
really ?
fantastic
that 's about what it feels like to be on the beach with you right now .
so , what was it like being married ?
but there 's something that feels so good about sharing your life with somebody .
well , we grew up together .
tell me about the guy at work who talked too much .
you were waking up but had forgotten about .
even if you get home late and i 'm already asleep ..
because i love the way you look at the world .
okay .

and we 're getting divorced .
it 's , um , marked here in the red where you need to sign .
i can just get it out of the way
i mean , i feel like it 's true to what i set out to do , so i 'm happy about that .

it 's me , i couldn 't get out of my head .
and the way you guys love each other without any judgment .
isabella , that 's not true .
is there anything else , though ?
why do you do that ?
nothing , it 's just , you go , " whew , " as you 're speaking and it seems odd .
oh . did i ?
it 's just maybe an affectation . i probably picked it up from you .
i guess that 's just .. i was trying to communicate . that 's how people talk .
because they 're people . they need oxygen .
what is your problem ?
you think i don 't know that i 'm not a person ? what are you doing ?
i don 't know what 's wrong with me .
you were saying everything was fine , but all i was getting from you ..
i know . i do that .
i 'd be upset about something and not be able to say it

i didn 't know how to . it just started happening .

penelope mentioned you met with ted . how was that ?

okay . first we tie up rex
not long enough to trace the call
i want a tracer put in that bag
swat 2 : all right , tactical command , red team .
but when he gets there ...
then we call him from the second dark phone ,
you 'll wanna pull into the garage
and we tell him if anyone follows him in ,
the police will lose the signal from his wire
i then tell him to give me his jacket and tie .
.. dad pulls out with the new red bag just as he was instructed .
get your goddamn kids out of the fantasy .
they 're not even allowed at this pool .

what 's going on ?
why ?
and i don 't know where ,
so we were able to remove all of the necrotic tissue ,

who i banged in a bathroom
it 's what happened !
but none of this has to do with me .
entirely about you .
with the storm and everything , and we 're all just ..
it didn 't make it , did it ?
no , i 've just lived on the side of the mountain
an ex-marine showed me how to do it ...
oh , i can 't believe i have to build that house again .

we always encouraged him to hope .
to david , jews were not poles .
i live where he lived . i stole his life .

it goes to one of the big auction houses .
when was , uh .. ?
yeah , we got a call from a woman ,
did she give a name ?
that 's horrible .

your glee at another man 's misfortune should trouble me ,
maybe later you could be the principal
uh , i don 't think so . why ?
she looks half your ... beauty .
i know . setting up one last thing for us to fight over ,
what ?
oh , cool .
aww , bless her hoarding heart .
i had so much promise back then .

churchyard years ago , and stayed there !

an o .
it 's astonishing !
perhaps i could teach you one day , joe .
be it so , be it so .
not like you , young scholar !
ever the best of friends , joe .
goodness , well , that might take a little time .
do you know the name of the house , boy ?
is that greek or iatin ?
enough house . that 's a curious name .
and you have reared the boy with the intention of making him your apprentice ?
the boy has made no objection to the trade ?
oh , enough ! estella .
yes , um ...
dead , sir .
passed away five years since , while on the rampage . i miss her .
condolences , yes .
i 'm pretty well known .
joseph gargery , i 'am the bearer of an offer ..
i am here to inform you that he has great expectations .
do you have any objections ?
you 've no objections to that , i dare say .
and the second stipulation ,
i understand .
mr gargery , this is for you .
as compensation for the loss of his services .
if you think money can make compensation
very touching , i 'm sure do you want the money or no ?
joe .
no . they 're by no means splendid ,
come on .
i beg your pardon ?
the pale young gentleman .
miss havisham fancied that she wanted to see me play .
poor taste on her part.but just as well .

you know what i am , don 't you ?
sir .
get up !
pepper , i 've told you i 'm not to be woken unless the ..
i brought you a toasting fork as a present ,
my life has changed since then .

many a thousand mile off .
i 've done wonderful well .
yes .
i would like , if i may ,
before you go .
kind ? who am i to be kind ?
to punish my relations .
estella .
i have loved you since i first saw you in this house .
clearly the idea was absurd ,
when you say you love me ,
did i not warn you ?
did you not think i meant it ?
now , i ain 't gonna tell you my life like a song or a story book ,
that 's my life .. until i met my boy here .
i need you to tell me about compeyson .
is he still alive ?
i would strongly advise your uncle to pack his bags .
and it 's fair to presume that mr compeyson does not wish him well .
you told me he 'd never come back .
he mustn 't find out , ever.poor , poor , abel .
abel will never find out.i 'll ensure that .
you swore she 'd have a brand-new life !
magwitch and molly had a child .
bu ! molly was a fierce one , wild and passionate like her husband ,
his wife , however , was not safe .
cold-blooded and ruthless ,
put the case that a woman accused of murder went to see her
put the case that the legal adviser said to the mother of the child ..
if you are saved , your child is saved .
and the child was your fee ?
not a bit of it .
i had a little child once .
pretty little thing . a girl .
but there weren 't a day , as i was rotting on that hulk ,
maybe that 's why i took to you so strong .
you speak as if we 're parting .
we can no more see to the bottom of the next few hours
and it 's run through my fingers and gone .
listen !
uh , did someone just call me a major flag ?
that 's hector rodriguez , my therapist .

my plan to get nash back will work .
yes ! by day .

i got a great tip from the butcher on searing the meat first .
oh , dear . you 're still angry with me .
i lost my business , my children never call me ,
when i complained
i see . that 's the reason you 've always been
the point is , looking at what has been taken from us
could you pass me the tape ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm feeling a little faint .
it 's like sneakers mixed with cologne
yeah . i think i 'm gonna hold off on that for a while .
because .

so that 's what this is about . you 're competing with bob and lee .
i 'm building her self-esteem
oh , mike , look at this place .
excuse me . if i could borrow a moment of your time
it seems many of you have some misguided ideas
no , not necessarily .
it 's laparoscopic . the scarring is minimal .
poor lee . he must be pretty embarrassed .
she always stumbles over that pant .
oh , that 's right . oh. oh , hey ! wait !
whoo ! bravo !

beth ? i didn 't even know she got tested .
and she wants to do this ?

or we could stay home and eat money .
ohh , look at that .
nothing . the filet mignon just went by .
s-so should we just go over and get paige ?
i want to watch .
she 's probably ordering milk for paige .
wow . she really is bad at this .
why did that woman give you this baby ?
but i don 't mind .
really ? that 's beautiful .
are you ready to order ?
oh , your drinks will be right out .
i gave you a baby . where is it ?
i cannot live without real music much longer .

i cut the windows , a bit bigger ...
set some new spokes and fellows .
i put a sliding bolt on the door .

well , it wasn 't always like this .
" half in california with judy . "
oh , come on , girl .
there you go .
i 'll let the clerk give you the whole spiel
is that this place lost its gambling license
so all the swells took their business elsewhere .
and they 'll even rent you a room by the hour
thank you .
that 's probably the only reason that a priest
always wanted to stay in the honeymoon suite ..
the lady 's got a harder hand than we do , father .
i am very sorry to keep you waiting .
the el royale is a bi-state establishment .
or the great state of nevada .

my dear bilbo , what on earth is the matter ?
i am surrounded by dwarves . what they 're doing here ?
i don 't want to get used to them .
i 've never stolen anything in my life .
can neither fight nor fend for themselves .
hobbits are remarkably light on their feet .
and while the dragon is accustomed to the smell of a dwarf ,
there 's a lot more into him than his appearances suggest .
including himself
time required , remuneration , funeral arrangements , so fort
understood .
agreed .
for injuries inflicted by or sustained

they must have come down from the ettenmoors .
one that can summon the spirits of the dead

ur business is o concern of eves
it 's mine to protect !
save me from the stubbornness of cwarves ,
slow it to lord elrond !
it 's mainly academic .
you still read ancient dwarvish , do you not ?
moon runes can only be read by the light
it would seem you were meant to come to rivendell .
the same moon shines upon us tonight .
which is the start of the dwarves ' new year ,
you 're part of the company . you 're one of us .

this is not what i was expecting .
don 't be silly . of course ido .
" not tonight . "
rules no matter how miserable it makes her .
who would rather be good than happy .
do you mind signing for her ?
each other all the time .
oh , god . oh , god . oh , god . oh , god .
and you 're also keeping all your options open .
girls haven 't made a peep .
no more options .
is a small price to pay for happiness .
oh , my god . it was so worth cutting class to hear this .
what happened to the good girl ?
frankly , i think it looked better on me .
sorts lately. and i just couldn 't understand why .
and then it hit me .
this is from both worlds .
i can 't tell you , you got to close your eyes .

well , i think that 's a mistake , yeah ?
in light of your seniority , you will be given a retirement package .
jeff duhaim , emiliano grassi ,
don 't ever trust anyone here , adam .
that 's it ? i mean , you just pack up your things and leave ?
they toss you out like a bag of garbage .
now , this is for your collection .
you 're ready ?
okay and ..
what happened to you ?
uh , you know what ?
i 've been meaning to call you .
take me to lunch ?
yeah , you can come up with a better story by then .
no , i thought we could eat out .
shit !
no , no , no ! i 'd love to .
really , they were rude ?
they just kept talking about you and how great you are ,
why does that bother you so much ?
it 's like having optimus prime over to dinner
you 're not always the smartest person in every room .
oh , i am sorry .
i got thats
you jam it in the stomach .
you give it a pull back
i don 't like the look in your eye .
why didn 't you include any names ?
i 've seen it happen a number of ways .
son , in my opinion ,
leave it blank for now .
you should give it some thought .
five .
hello ?
take it easy , leticia .
i want extra time outside for the next two weeks .
cellphones allowed in here ?
extra time outside
maybe you don 't think you
but what i do know is that

how ?
to tell you the truth
6 months from now i 'm at the gate .
no . the moment has passed .
how goes your little project ?
ah , a combination of all your names .
i assume " koothranardowitz " was taken ?
oh , well then , by all means , carry on .
howard , did you solve the install time problem yet ?
i 'm gonna try having it pick up the libraries dyn ..
no , that was completely called for . we need quiet .
well , seeing as your project is to sabotage my project , yes .
if you don 't want me here ,
nobody knows
well , based on the fact that our potential market
you know , get the word of mouth going .
what 's he doing in your apartment ?
why do you regret .. uh , never mind , stupid question .
we 're not playing .
we 're going to be hundred-aires .
then i guess we would let him back on the app team ,
i 'll tell you one thing . if i get rich enough ,
really ?
oh , yes . he says they are lost without you .
it tastes bad in my mouth .
okay , fair enough . maybe a little picky , though ,
oh , hey , uncle cam .
you 're welcome , but you have to be more careful .
lisa was drinking , and i took her keys ,
seriously ?
honey , you don 't drink coffee .
she 's nice .

come on , don 't be like that .
what ?
not all science pans out .
well , that sounds awful .
well , on the bright side ,
mm , given i might be unemployed ,
oh , hang on .
" on the other hand , contrary to predictions ,
uh , not surprisingly , when penny moved out ,
isn 't that just vodka with blue dye in it ?
he said , " i hope all your correlations
you know , you 're a successful woman .
well , so should you .
tell me about it . howie texts me
i mean , if we weren 't physicists , w-what would we be ?
it 's fine . i don 't need to be a theoretical physicist .
i could be an accountant for the mob .
okay . this is getting silly .
that is enough .
your careers are not at a dead end .
instead of feeling sorry for yourselves ,
i don 't know . you know , when i 'm feeling down ,
i 'm sorry , i just.i don 't ..
i 'm sorry , i just have to go .
can we ... can we go back into the car ?
like an ex-girlfriend or something ?
is that someone that you knew ?
what are you doing ?
don 't worry .
but i need you to remember what i 'm saying
somebody gave it to me .
back in the car .
or it could be a stranger in a crowd .
he could look like anyone .
help !
but though i have wept and fasted ,
there 's an old woman at school today .
it was like she was following me .
no , but she freaked me out .

i mean something knocked me over and the door didn 't break on it own .
what do you think it was then ?
and i will to-tear it up .
'cause if it 's that ass , i already got that covered .
easy , easy . what are you , shipping off to war ?
girls ...
there 's no fancy tables or pretty chairs .
even i don 't look good here .
we have some adorable old-school ice cream tables and chairs
okay , girls , well , call me when you have a real business .
i don 't think so .
oh , my god .
he 's gone . he went into the kitchen .
should we call the cops ?
let 's just get out of here .
for someone to get their passage right ?
there . go open the door .
max has to put ruth in her place
by the way , where is she ?
text her and find out where she is .

jupiter jones
outside the cleopeides . better get a move on .
lord titus will see you now .

lies are a necessity .
honestly , lies are sometimes the only reason i get out of bed .

beauty and her beast .
so you can plead for this .
i kept it , knowing how you felt , even if you wouldn 't admit it .
but now if you can believe anything , jupiter ,
titus .
thank you .
sure you want to go into a fight with someone you can 't trust ?
kiza 's got the bug . couldn 't afford the recode .
she 's the only good thing i 've done with this life .

your highness .
a necessary feature for all royal weddings .
let 's hit it !
i enter into this union being of sound mind and of my own volition .
break left , i 'm going right !
good evening , your majesty .
where 's my family ?
i see you have the standard issue abrasax temper .
you and your lord are trespassing in this precinct .
i have been instructed to offer your grace a proposal .
they will abdicate your title
if you abdicate , you 'll have nothing to protect yourself .
your majesty , i could not even consider such an abhorrent crime .
if i were trying to wound you , mr. night , you wouldn 't be breathing
very well . i will inform my lord you have rejected his offer .
waiting to be converted into capital .
and beautiful machine defined by evolution ,
if that 's what your mother taught you , then i can see why you hated her .
and yet , you 're trying to kill me .
made me understand that every human society is a pyramid
is that why you killed her ?
i know because of who and what you are , you 're unable to say this ...
you lied in the commonwealth because you 're a hunter ...
understood
thank you .
once i seal this .
i can promise that you will not see it .
you knew nothing of harvesting before . why should it matter now ?
i came here to try to protect my family .
is that right ?
not anymore .
i am making sure that whatever you do to me and my family ,
i am not my brother or my sister .
mr. night ! it is an emergency !
captain , i 'm tracking a ping . is it her majesty ?
this is captain tsing of the aegis . we are tracking . can you click back ?
i have the family . can you extract ?

that 's when the plane passes ..
okay , you folks enjoy the rest of your flight .
can you please stay the fuck away from us ?
oh , rusty .
or the time that pan continental put us up at the ritz in barcelona .
i never took the uniform off , except when i did .
oh , gosh . i 'll get you a new guitar , okay ?

" so do you like school this year ? "

all my other friends , uh , who saw my paris pics , they clicked " like . "
paris .
we 're driving to walley world .
we gotta shake things up , right ? spend a little quality time .
uh , by locking them in a car together ?
don 't say weird shit !
kevin , bullying ! guys , come on .
so you just wanna redo your vacation from 30 years ago ?
no , no , no . we 're not redoing anything . this will be completely different .
the new vacation will stand on its own , okay ?
what do you say ? we can drive out and fly back .
couldn 't be as bad as that stupid cabin , right , honey ?
all right .
are we gonna drive all that way in your little car ?
come on , guys , heh . how come you didn 't follow me just then ?
yeah , that 's why i dangled the key like that .
okay .
hey , honey . what 's all that ?
okay , gang
honey , gps check ?
your destination is 2500 miles ahead
what ? how is that possible ? we 've been driving for less than an hour .
i mean , we have plenty of theme parks at home .
oh , god , it 's horrible . just please turn it off .
why is it so much angrier than the other voices ?
honey , it doesn 't like when you touch it , okay ?
and then you have to get through the course as fast as you can .
no , yeah . but , honey , it 's for charity , see ?
oh , no . we 're just stopping by .
i love this song
there used to be a graying tower alone on the sea
did you know that when it snows
it 's a man . and the coolest man ever .
baby i compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
that your rose is in bloom
gunning it .
well , the guy said it was right at the end of this road , so ..
hold on .
looks like we found our own private hot spring .
the water 's perfect .
man , this place makes our house look like shit .
especially when you make a lot more of them , heh .
shoot , you boys are growing faster than a weed under a faucet .
i can 't tell you how many nights we spent drinking bourbon together ...
it 's true , they did . they literally cried together .
yeah , that 's , uh ..
not embarrassing to me .
what is with these faucets ?
course none of that would 've been possible without my sugar mama here
but it kind of gave me purpose .
wow , uncle stone , i may not agree with your politics ..
after dad flipped out there .
and we were . and that 's all i want for my family .
you 're a clown
little something ...
yeah , not to walley world
that 'd be stupid . how about paris ?
well , not while there 's breath in my body , sweetheart .
yeah ?
she and stone seem really in love . it 's nice .
weird . why would they be stretched out in the . ?
i don 't know where you 're going with this ..
oh , my god .
no , i didn 't , rusty . it was loose .
hey , morning
well , i gotta be at the station by 7 : 30 ...
hey , you ever ride one of these things ?
oh , my god . this is so illegal .
yeah .
i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry .
get down ! get down on the ground !
you get down too . you get down too .
what do i get ? kids who don 't wanna be with me , and a wife who 's miserable .
oh , come on , debbie .
well , guess what .
i don 't wanna be away from you and the kids that long
and the lost gardens of
forget this whole stupid trip .
then the muffin made the car explode , but it didn 't matter .
by the guy with the rat on his shoulder .
oh , james , that 's terrible .
the journey sucks .
you had a dream to take your family to walley world .
hey , come on .
oops , wrong door .
ha , ha . no , no .
boys , when your father makes you a promise , he keeps it .
wow , this place is huge .
this is dope as fuck .
uh , for example ...
why don 't you keep it ?
yeah , i don 't need anything around that i can stab myself with .
as a kindness , i should probably take all the games .
in fact , you can have everything .
are you sure ?
well , now they 're yours .
well , you know what 's gonna happen .
for a man so good at predicting my moves ,
why don 't you let leonard keep a few things ?
you know what ?
yeah , take whatever you want .
yeah , i like this one .
but you made me order it because you were " too well-known "
oh , i do .
come along , amy .
how did you know it wasn 't me ?
that 's rai .
have some bread while it 's still warm .
hey , this pregnancy had an emotionally-needy
is this what you do when i 'm not here ,
thank you .
i think i 'm gonna go for a run .
no , last time that old lady in the park kept screaming ,
a .... week from friday .
you 're right !
i have to get married ,
wait . i don 't want to be the one who stands in your way .
oh , well . but i forgive you .
we 'll have the wedding when you get back .
we 'll call them .
i was plenty scary .
that 's the point , claire . it was overkill .
right .
the principal thought i did it on purpose
that 's it ! i 'm going to his house !
i 'm not sure if it 's the pregnancy ,
my country is covered in coffee .
half-caf , non-fat wet soy latte .
okay . bye .
oh , it 's just your poor dad , you know .
i 'll fill you in at the staff meeting
you are so doing that at christmas talent night .
then a " maneater " encore .
close your eyes , it could have been the real band .
oh , i 'm so scared !
well , this night was a bust .
or did i speak too soon ?
oh , hi , princess .
am i in trouble ?
um ... well , do you remember how we used to tell you
sorry , i let it slip . we 'll deal with it later .
why are you talking like this ?
sorry , sweetie .
i do
i always try to hold a little something back .
no , no , no , no , no , no . leave him .
okay .
you , too , sam .
so i think that , you know , since you ...
no fever . you don 't seem to be vomiting .
yes .
and you can start by prepping my atresia kid .
did he receive any treatment then ?
he works very hard .
five , uh , if you count me .
he 's given me everything , so please ..
he 's in v-fib .
clear !
lisa . her name is lisa .
we read that 's important .
we know that ex vivo takes less time ,
one second .
dr. stark .
yeah , i gotta check on that kid 's harvest team .
what ? i
wait , sir , are you splitting the liver
those folks have been spending a little too much time
her name 's lisa .
well , we all could .
how bad is it ?
maybe a little less party planning .
look , between you and me , he 's a good man .
wow . every time i talk to you , i feel a little more relaxed .
there is no way of
can we have assurances that your finest surgeons
he didn 't mean the finest surgeons in this hospital .
quiet , please . thank you .
but we all have the same goal ,
i am your only shot , and you have to take me .
you 'd feel pretty good about your chances .
good luck .
tell them they can 't operate .
yeah , you 've been saying that a lot today .
apparently i hold the whole fate of
avery , i need you where i need you .
no , ma 'am . that 's fine .
i 'm saying , with this letter , there 's a time frame now .
i 'm saying an intervention is not a good plan .
it 's not an intervention , shepherd .
he 's got three discharges .
dr. stark is in surgery .
what ?
it 's so simple .
it is the right shape , and it 's celluloid ,
whose idea was it , dr. stark , originally ?
let 's just see if it works .
would you please let the dog out ?
she 's delirious .
bypass would be so much better .
okay . good . there . i can clip the aneurysm .
i am trying to do a coronary graft
all right .
all right . pack that . i tried everything i could for yang .
uh , can i use avery ?
well , that 's good to know .
a ping
alex karev .
because if the pressure doesn 't find a way out ...
oh , listen . let me talk to her .
i 'm going to visit caroline 's horse .
which is everything .
i figured out the best way to go see chestnut .
sounds exotic . do i need a travel shot ?
i am so excited to see my baby again .
in the lifetime movie version ,
sorry to bother you .
i just got my period .
yes , this is not appropriate talk .
they 've been a quarter forever .
harriet tubman used to get her tampons here .
emphasis on the man .
hey , hey !
look , han , everyone knows there are certain things
off the top of my head ,
it is only two more quarters .
that 's outrageous .
if men were the ones who got periods ,
oh , now you tell me you have coupons ?
i didn 't wanna tell you at all , she made me .
look , it 's not a big deal .
you don 't even like them .
they were free .
who doesn 't like free money ?
chestnut 's fine .
ooh , oh , i just got another text from chestnut .
in the lifetime movie version ,
i get it , it 's just that after last night ,
i found this woman online
canned pumpkin ?
great , ' cause i 'm always lying in bed at night
a pretty pineapple daisy says so much more than cash in a card .
that 's perfect because my mom was 40 % off a regular mom .
better , look .
i 'm about to get my tamp on .
oh , what do you think you are doing ?
in case , uh ...
those are not straws .
didn 't your mother ever teach you
come on wall street , if you can sell it ,
you take it down .
no , it is free market .
i am the boss .
and i don 't cry .
i 'll be real quick .
if i had a cue-pon for every time i heard that from a guy .
if i combine these with the in-store bonus ,
come on , start pulling out the ones for the cake mix .
no , that was a breeze .
oh , my god , i can 't believe it .
where 'd she leave her crown , in the minivan ?
we don 't have time for this .
there , calm down , have a treat .
freddie , and i can 't talk right now
i know . you say that on your show .
who 's the queen now ?
look at you and your fancy coat .
told you i 'd come by to see you .
bugs bunny status , like i know you like .
the grass is greener .
we can 't seem to get cal to pee indoors .
and , mitchell , you are killing it at the office .
because i-i feel like i 'm kind of getting
there 's actually a big case that i am working on ,
please let it be one of their kids .
i started to , but it really seems like
that seems odd .
what time you flying out , artie ?
so , rob , gabrielle told me
i got beer for tonight . youl excited ?
just threw it in the cart at the shop ' n save .
hey , so , it is your last chance to change your bet ,
she is a 13-year-old
this is her year .
yeah , i have no idea .
so , i was thinking we could drink every time somebody asks
all right ? take a deep breath .
and it 's gonna be great .
it 'll make you last longer .
yeah , and i 'm feeling plenty of guilt then , too .
i 'm just .. really out of it .
i was having a crazy dream .
too bad the special olympics doesn 't have a comedy competition .
does anyone know the warning signs of a stroke ?
arthur , i thought you were gonna be here early .
hey .
i don 't really have a test tomorrow .
oh , no .
rob ! ah !
i have some more bad news for you .
can i confess something to you ?
what the fuck is happening ? !
that wasn 't yours to touch .
yeah , you should really listen to your girlfriend .
i mean , why do you pick on guys like me ?
i think you 're gay and you don 't
tommy 's gay .
the guys are super supportive .
yeah , i guess it would have been worse if you guys played a real sport , right ?
probably for the best .
you know , there are other
in this school , even .
i 'm talking about living a life without repercussions .
hey , didn 't your cousin get admitted to south oaks ?
thank you for bringing that up .
you know , i just woke up this morning , and long story short , i
yeah , you guys go .
show me your hall pass .
i 'm gonna have to write you up .
you don 't know the power that you possess .
a line on a college resume ?
like , tell me that you won 't write me up
she curb-stomped my genitals . with her shoes .
your mom and dad are on their way , by the way .
seems like to me you 're going for
yeah , in your pants .
come on !
it 's just a little mayo .
that 's a special sandwich , you little pervert !
what the fuck is wrong with you ?
no . i was yelling at my dick because it won 't get hard .
it sure sounds like it . do you want to watch ?
i really need to jerk off , but it 's not working , and i
just help me or get the fuck away .
i 'm not in a good place right now .
i 'd do anything for you .
tracing the man 's slow fall into madness .
okay , let 's get started .
oh , no , if it 's okay , i 'm just ... i 'm gonna stand .
not gonna lie . today has been a never-ending cluster fuck .
but as i 've learned
you have a very impressive application .
i have lived to get into this school .
hell , at one point , i was so nervous i might have even over-performed .
i don 't know . ii haven 't done this part yet .
you can do different things .
okay . all right . that 's great .
i don 't , but , uh , i 'm worried about you now , so ..
okay , um .
rob !
a mammogram .
oh , my god .
just forget it .
we can talk to the smartest person i know .
like a jinx !
ow should i know ?
well , if it 's not , then solve it for me
you have to figure out what made the curse start and fix it .
aw , motherfucker !
you know , i wanted to for , like , the longest time , and it
you know what could be really fun ?
okay .
yeah , but isn 't this better ?
and i 'm sorry ... white zinfandel ?
okay , then you can get the fuck out of here .
can you drive ?
why don 't we get some fries , too ?
well , it 's too late to knock .
really ?
when i woke up this morning , i expected to be here tonight .
how 's it going up there ?
that is my georgetown interviewer .
what are they doing here ?
just listen , okay ?
rob , leave .
ugh ! this isn 't about angela !
but i obviously ruined all that , so ..
oh , shit .
you 're gonna start having feelings .
yeah , yeah . it 's his first bee , so ...
origin . that is a great stall .
oh , no . he 's imploding
oh , don 't be such a pussy . come on .
come on ! don 't be s. oh , wow !
unfortunately , you 've gone
does anyone know where his mother is ?
when i had my lisp ?
tell me .. what were we doing ?
hey , maybe we could recreate it
the residents of wisteria lane are nothing if not loyal .
they root for the home team ...
but the fiercest loyalty on wisteria lane
stop .
then you 're not going .
that woman sat our table , spent the holidays with us ,
does look a little neglected .
oh . i ... can 't do that .
oh , sorry . and sorry about the mess .
you look thin . are you eating ?
i 'm fine . i 'm a little behind on my chores .
paul , um .. are you sure you 're okay ?
good-bye .
oh ! bob ! lee !
how fantastic is it that chris cavanaugh is speaking ?
i 've heard him speak before . he 's even better in person .
meg bulter . president of amtech .
my husband is the c.f.o. of morris technologies .
what 's that mean ?
the seminars are only for participants .
hey , don 't worry .
attention !
bree .
i just came by to talk to lynette .
she asked me to water the plants and collect the mail .
i never told a soul about your role that night ,
i understand .
we have so much catching up to do .
uh , wh-where are you staying ?
we 're going to be neighbors :
old friend ? you look like you 've seen a ghost .
your hand ! let me call you an ambulance .
martha ? y-yeah .
there 's no doubt in my mind .
oh , please . i can get a face full of steam
i know , and i asked , and they said no .
tom , i 'm not a child .
i 'll decide what i want to do .
when i 've been five or six times ,
let 's go , mrs. scavo .
this is why you keep us drunk , huh ?
this hits the spot .
i was talking about him .
well , maybe the dream is telling you to follow that impulse .
it 's natural to be concerned about him
it 's your call ,
paul 's very charming when he wants to be , and beth ...
well , didn 't you try to warn her ?
when he was released , when he had defiled her ,
s-so she killed herself ...
bastard .
beth would hate for all her friends
sol can watch him !
but i won 't let him destroy another woman
no , no , tell him he has a choice .
yes .
i guess that rule only applies to plus ones .
i wanna grab a soak before the keynote speech . bye .
huh ? oh , hi .
meg butler . meg .
uh .. great .
paul , you have to let me talk to you .
because you 're a mess , and someone has to do something .
dreams ? what kind of dreams ?
sure . no problem .
oh , no ! got it all over me .
in fact ..
so last time you and i had a meal together .
that was a long time ago .
susan ...
why do you care ?
hey . this is not about a cake . this is about trust .
do you have any idea how offensive that is ?
ahh . there .
if only trust were so easy to make .
and they ... they-they don 't wear underwear .
uh , do .. do you love this girl ?
but she knows how important star wars is to me .
how important she is to you .
sheldon , you-you can see this movie whenever you want .
be with her .
great .
the two of them away together ,
well , if you think i 'm afraid of birds ,
you guys think the same way and we all come home .
this location 's been abandoned for 34 hours .
expect a violent reaction .
and let 's not forget , these are not hostile enemies .
they have the same goal we do ...
just like ebola .
what 's our eta ?
good .
someone is on the premises .
why didn 't he radio us directly ?
checking with ase ops now .
it 's been stalled too long already .
not stir up any public panic .
i am in command of this mission .
okay .
dr. mudfly .
my lord .
there is great concern for her majesty 's health .
she 'll be lucky to last the week .
you got a dying queen ? not for long .
oh , uh , wait . wait for me !
shut up , blair !
ta-ra .
you must let nothing pass her lips that hasn 't been made and served by you .
that 's us to the carriage .
very important .
stand back , everyone , while i secure the perimeter .
i do so admire how you don 't give up .
good luck .
no ! no .
oh , i can 't look .
do it again ! do it again ! do it again ! do it again !
so , while i remain here
you got me on the ropes , you have , cheech .
jab , jab , cross .
i really don 't want to fight you .
it 's a therapeutic session .
stop worrying , john .
i 'll be back before you even miss me .
i think i 'm beginning to understand a little bit of what the animals are saying .
sir , i 'm afraid your obsession with dolittle is .
i 'm not obsessed with dolittle .
you 're the one obsessing about my obsession with dol ...
but luckily , i think i know where he 's going .
she had such a sure hand .
what did they offer you , mudfly , to murder the queen of england ?
chair of the royal college .
blood rushing to my head . everything turning red .
thank you .
teamwork makes the dream work .
to put it simply ,
what unites such a group of creatures ?
.. we just belong together .
lily would have loved it , john .
i just got the chills , and i 'm not even cold .
we know , o lord , that there is no word impossible to thee ;
i 'm sorry we couldn 't save you , your majesty .
in that case , i would use 1-0 nylon retention sutures
because i would make sure the area
finished . yes , i know . i 'm sorry .
it 's very distracting .
if you get distracted this easily .
certainly calls it into question .
it 's just , no one can seem to make up their own mind today .
they just need a little help getting there .
okay , if someone comes to me with a problem ...
a metaphor ?
now the next time someone comes to you with a problem ,
see ? that 's the beauty of it .
you didn 't forget snack today did you ?
damn . and if they 're here ...
uh , lack of use ?
that 's right . it 's too late for this muscle .
they 've even gone into his heart .
at this point ,
dr. grey ?
what about an abscess ?
well , apparently , you have ruled it out .
if you say so .
precisely my question , dr. yang .
and i a thousand times .
that 's ... fine , too .
mm-hmm .
you can take the exam again next year .
that was a trick question .
yeah , but my answer was wrong .
w-what is he pointing at ?
the drapes ? yeah , she 's sterile .
infection spread to the ex-fix .

but what can you do ?
and when i came to , i jumped off the brooklyn bridge .
she jumps in the east river .

it was like watching a dream .
sit down , honey .
now .. you see what i 'm doing here ?
okay . okay , i-i get it .
am i making my point ?
you gotta , you know , loosen up .
i can 't stop thinking about all those men out there
they are spending their hard-earned dollars
boys , boys , it 's been a month .
isn 't that what they do ?
she looks lost .
anyway , obviously .... .
you can. send me a check .

uh , no , i meant here , lynette .
hey ! how 'd it go with the doctor ?

you 're gonna wanna sit down .
and you 're the one who told me to go to the doctor .
oh , " take long baths or get in some extra naps " ?
gosh , i wish i could , tom .
i wanted tonight to be special .
about that ..
but there are certain other ... .
i have nothing to hide .
good morning .
ah , i was up kinda late .
you were up with tom ?
no surprise after the way things went
oh , i don 't want to get in the middle .
why ? you catch him , uh , grating cheese on his abs ?
must 've been pretty bad for you
i guess i was hoping ...
that one day i might outgrow all this .
i just can 't have him around . he 's too distracting .
and how would that happen ?
all i know is that not living your life isn 't the answer .
well , then get good , because take my word for it ,
cool .
uh , he and renee went out to dinner .
yeah . they went to that french restaurant dad likes .
oh , i want .
nah , i 've got plans tonight .
cool .
there ya go .
you know , you 're gettin ' good as this .
i 'm also getting good at lying to my husband .
how 'd you find me ?
no . your answering service said i might find you here .
but he bought a maserati .
very temperamental ,
i 'm no maserati , keith .
well , i 'm sorry about that ,
and the truth is , my life 's kind of a mess , too .
my house , not my life .
i really do sound like a maserati .
oh , my god .
the good news is ,
do you think you can offer me that ?
good .
but just so we 're clear ,
the way things have been going lately .
you 're welcome .
i think i like having you around .
it 's late , isn 't it ? yeah , our truck already passed .
sounds good to me .
good to meet you too .
really ?
seemed like a nice guy .
it sent me into a bit of a rough patch .
yeah , no , i revised the plan to include the open staircase .
okay . great .
oh , yeah , yeah , yes . gordo , hi .
that is going to be simon 's office
he 's like , terrified . i have to get rid of it . you want it ?
no . no
it 's going to come up looking real nice . it 's already great .
i should go and check on that .
oh , i don 't want to ...
like in , you know , information protection .
don 't know how to use it .
kind of widening out .
i want you to start rebuilding the business .
i just don 't want you to be stressed , honey ,
okay .
why do you get a name like weirdo ?
maybe .
breaking in to give us something ? it 's not very bright .
i hope his next gift is a sushi knife for those fish .
ha-ha
the fish are beautiful . really beautiful . thank you .
you know , most people think that sammy davis jr. or nina simone
yeah .
my dad named him , actually .
i love you for it , but you know .
but he would offer an alternative , you know ?
so basically , eventually , you two need to have a conversation .
yep .
come on . i really don 't think that is the reason why .
why all the drop in 's and the stop by 's
i think you 're slightly exaggerating .
i think he wants to nail you .
please know that i would never do anything to upset you both ,
you won 't hear from me again ,
turn it over . there 's more
but he seems okay , right ? other than that ?
so whatever this was , let 's put it behind us .
you know , what do you say ?
simon ?
i 'm glad you said that , ' cause
i thought we left all this back in chicago .
you got yourself a doctor too already ?
simon , i .
he made peace with us . i think that we have to make peace with him .
" cause i 'm not feeling good right now .
why would he
you 're probably paranoid from the pills .
i didn 't take any .
no , i didn 't take any . no , i wasn 't .
this has nothing to do with pills
will you please just listen to me ?
robyn , it 's over .
and jangles .
you asked me if there 's something i want to tell you .
is there something that you wanna tell me ?
i00k at what he 's done to us . this is his faut .
that 's why we 've got to just put it behind us .
it heals everything .
let 's make a family .
it 's really important to not look back .
listen , so don 't look now ,
oh , my god .
well , robyn , don 't
yeah .
i 'm going to take that too .
i don 't mean to interrupt .
goodbye . have fun , you guys .
bye . don 't let mom drink too much .
" put your mind at ease . this guy is a nobody . "
robyn , why don 't you just ask him ?
what are you going to do ?
simon 's sister said he was involved somehow
greg pierson .
" simon , just after all these years , "
look , i think he wants to hurt us
if you were helping him ,
god , this is crazy .
she told me that he was found in a car with a
long time . i saw you up there . wanted to say hello .
i wanted to apologize .
about how i might not have treated you so well ,
you see , it 's too late for that .
you know , i was willing
see , you 're done with the past ,
it 's a saying .
hey , i asked you a question .
i gave you a chance .
all credit goes to kevin .
thank you . do you hear ? he said , " all credit goes to kevin "
what the hell was that
you just jumped . you jumped so far .
was that the glass ?
i saw the e-mail , you asshole !

and my price includes that horse .
you look like you wanna die .
i just like killin ' men .
do i know you ?
well , i don 't know if i can honor your dying wish ,
no , no , no , no , not so fast .
iust leave .. leave me alone
in a world that don 't celebrate being alone .
you will run from this man and you do not look back .
grandpa !
uh , you have any ..
pond water 's not the best water .
so you 're headed south , huh ?
hmm .
passing the big trail yesterday .
what time of day yesterday ?
those mexicans you .... you saw , they .
they came in the night and they took her .
my concern is that those riders
bloodshed and kidnapping to your door .
those men
i asked the men what it meant .
no . no , i was just following orders .
you were eventually .. sherman 's best killer ,
i have a granddaughter in my life here .
our tather , who art in heaven .
hallowed be thy name ! ...
louder ! thy kingdom come , thy .
you come to my office ..
we had a deal .
is this under the radar , brad ?
yeah , i don 't care what they see .
i 'm listening .
we give this thing to the press
ad said there are still people in the administration
but they 'll release the tape ..
and how can she discredit her own appointees ? sure .
we 'll have to find someone we can trust
she 'll do it ; she 'll find someone .
because this is our last shot .
well , it seems not that often
to get scofield . what ?
well , i can type , and scofield can 't see who 's sending him the messages .
but .. i 'm in school again .
i mean , it 's not the same
i guess i 'm just saying that ..
i just want to stay in one place ,
i , uh ..
okay .
i love you , too , son .
go down the hall , down the stairs to the basement .
the one on the left .
the judge comes to us .
do you see my clothes ?
my inhaler is in my jacket pocket ,
i 've got a spare in my glove box ,
my mother was an asthmatic .
what the hell difference does it make ?
you 're a real piece of work , you know that ?
just one .
you just remember him .
i don 't know where they went .
yeah .
then find them .
the brothers come back to a city that 's 15 miles
maybe it 's because the president is
burrows is innocent .
as advertised .
you of all people should know that .
she 's the only one i spoke to .
we got to get as much of that in
everything 's going to be perfect .
excuse me .
as a way to keep ticket prices low ,
they tell you to meet them at the statue .
then they send you to the building
dan ?
and , yes , even shed a tear or two ..
i don 't know . , maybe he didn 't like the fact
okay , look , i know what a good person you are ,
i 'm , like , the sweetest person i know .
yes , but once in a while ,
you one of those people ?
i-i think the cookie thing .
welcome back .
he puts the reading in your rainbow ,
to be honest , his research never amounted to anything .
how did your research turn out ?
hey , this is the apartment you get when you win a nobel .
i mean , maybe i come off a little strong ,
but there 's a difference between being tough
where ? to babies r us ?
okay , sorry . can we just go ?
oh , come on , they don 't hate you , all right ?
and if you touched the ground , burn you .
take that , glass ceiling .
one crazy ride .
i 'd like to share with you all one last use for a white flag .
good night .
sheldon ...
if you didn 't press record ..
well , that 's it .
and we still don 't know who framed him .
i guess the sad truth is ,
that 's a nice way of looking at it .
mom .. i want to meet him .
you were yelling in your sleep .
i 'm .. i 'm doing a painting job .
shades of yellow that go in the kitchen .
now if you don 't mind , i 'm gonna go back to sleep ,
it 's so great visiting a retirement village ...
what do i got to do to get you to hurry it over , build a fence ?
i 'm sure you can find one somewhere .
oh , go ahead . i got time to kill while i 'm waiting
i love her . what do you think ?
frank ... is very to the point .
oh . what else you need to know ?
i never noticed that before .
that doll .
heck , i 've had her since forever .
i couldn 't bear to toss her , so there she is .
see you at the wedding , lorraine .
well , he 's quite a ...
for my son who disowned me .
i 'm tired of hating people .
what a thing to say .
you 're a decent man .
what is that again ?
okay .
you just need to identify what 's negative in your life ..
that sounds like a plan .
actually , i wanna talk to you about gaby .
well , you know , we went through kind of a rough patch ,
girls , dinner 's ready ! i made your favorite ...
yeah , well , i don 't carry it around with me
gaby , i want you to be happy ,
this is clearly about grace .
we 're not supposed to talk about her !
i 'm going to get ready for dinner .
i kept her warm for ya .
and obviously it involves keith ,
anyway , i 'm ...
mommy . i can 't find my ball .
how old is charlie ?
i had actually moved out before i realized i was pregnant .
i had actually decided to give up the baby ,
after that , it just never felt right to come back
so charlie is the only reason you came ?
maybe i ... was kind of wondering
you seem really great .
i think i have to .
i 'm still waiting on a few pieces ,
i 've been thinking about this room for 20 years .
i used to imagine the kind of room
i never knew you thought about kids .
it 's never too late . heck , if we can adopt ..
this is not the color we agreed on for the trim .
i can 't wheel her down the aisle to marry some jackass
well , you know , how can i put this delicately ?
someday soon she will die .
that 's a horrible thing to say .
you 're lucky you 're holding the baby .
if you don 't support her ,
yeah ?
and think about the example
now , look , tom and i have a little savings ...
but ..
nobody needs me anymore .
bree seems to think your wife planted it there ,
so you 've never seen this before ?
yes .
i 'm not comfortable around firearms , that 's all .
detectives , i know for a fact this is not beth 's gun .
should we take two blankets or three ?
what ? why ?
oh , shoot .
trust me , beth .
they 're so excited about finally becoming fathers .
is that .... . still the case ?
that didn 't sound very convincing .
okay , well , let me rephrase it .
it was quicker than waiting for the gods to answer my prayers .
yes . their generosity knows no bounds .
dresses worthy of a princess . a new one every day .
a golden palace to raise our family .
well , this truly is a big day for the family .
king of all egypt !
gods .
my brother thought the afterlife was a gift .
from now on , you have to buy your way in with riches earned .
it 's yours now .
i looked up to you .
that would be unwise .
i thought your sight was perfect .
in the year that followed , many gods stood against him .
for mortals , things were worse
those who prayed for him to save egypt were sorely disappointed .
i had found zaya enslaved to a cruel master .
i 'd like to drop him from a great height .
is theft always the answer ?
even if you could free me , what about my family ? our friends ?
you really believe the gods care ?
i want to show you something
the perfect time for someone to sneak inside .
they say horus ' eyes are kept there .
steal from a god ?
the plans should be here .
the source of his power . no feasts .
the treasure will pass through the front gate .
it 's what comes after .
come on .
he will pass over its peak and marvel
i 'm sorry ?
taller ?
well , that might be difficult , um , now , i mean ...
i suppose because i proved to be the best , my lord .
he shall see it from dawn to dusk .
oh , gold , gold !
a toast !
a toast to my legacy .
enough to make you afraid of your own shadow .
i pride myself in an orderly office , zaya .
oh , and this pathetic little trinket of yours
it was all my idea .
give me back what you took .
i don 't need any more worshippers .
unless you brought more wine , get out .
what are you ? some thief ?
i have something set took from you .
go on .
there may be a way .
but the journey through the nine gates
if i kill set and take back the crown
my magnificent bloody hounds .
you are my children of iron and blood .
the rebel gods have choked on our spears .
but you , my legions of the desert , will bring them reckoning !
and if you should fall in battle and travel the nine gates ,
oh , in that case ,
stay there . be quiet .
and put the mortal below deck if you want him to live .
you shall never feast on my creation !
things would be different if i could dwell
egypt must never be destroyed by chaos .
that demon isn 't the one who murdered my father .
and the uncertainty of its destiny is my will .
allow me to fill my flask with these waters .
you plan to quench the desert fire .
grant me the power to fly again .
i let you come here and i grant you passage home .
without both my eyes , i doubt i 'm strong enough to beat set .
have you been so lazy for so long
hey !
not worth the papyrus it 's written on , hmm ?
i do not approve of how set rules .
lord , the last of the rebel gods have retreated behind her walls .
yes , sir .
she was your wife .
from now on , this will be the way of things .
better get used to it .
since you became king , the need for burial shrouds has been great .
you should know why i could not .
remember when you rode out of the desert .
and imagined the great deeds we would accomplish together .
some parts were sweet .
i still thought we could have been happy .
nothing can fulfill me .
why ?
maybe next time , keep flying until we 're actually on the ground .
i thought he was helping you .
the whole of the nile cannot quench set 's fire .
kill the desert .
ho , 1 .. well , yes .
i 'm not going to risk looking at those tricky eyes of yours .
excuse me ?
i 'm not even half done .
the answer to the riddle of the sphinx .
go ask the riddle and come back and relay it to me .
one ci us would have to die .
i don 't lie .
if i even attempted to explain ,
you tell me what kind of power do i really have ?
and i say we wait .
you 've always been in hathor 's heart , you know .
room enough for a crowd in there .
she did it for love . you 'd punish her for that ?
i only ever wanted one thing .
but you , my lord , are bigger than most .
of course you are .
my duty was to help dead souls make their way to the afterlife .
" seduced " ?
this keeps them at bay .
but i can 't see you .
but how ?
in return , he 's going to help us .
i know , zaya . i can hardly believe it myself
horus is a just god , as you said he would be .
well , yes . just a little bit .
you do know which is the door , right ?
no , no , it 's ... it 's that one .
perhaps we can help her .
it would require a very special treasure indeed .
ike this ?
you should have stayed under the sand .
of course you don 't understand . how could you ?
by the way , apophis is going to eat the land of the dead .
me just telling you about mine .
the story begins on the fields of jamaica where ..
usually works , yeah .
just one , man , it 's just her .
this is the bulwark police .
rosalinda , are you in there ?
gotta be aware of this stuff .
i do what i think best when i 'm out there .
there 's a reason i 'm sitting behind this desk running things
that wasn 't my point .
one thing before you go .
you threw a lot more cast-iron than you needed to .
you weren 't that rough .
it 's not healthy for you
couple more years out there and you 're gonna be
i gotta go .
yeah . i can save it .
his cousins are gonna be there this time .
i don 't like doing things
but they was moved up .
do you think our wages accurately reflect what we did ?
i 'm smarter than you by a yard stick ,
guiet .
shouldn 't engage them here .
fifty percent .
any yes or no question .
" the bank will reopen in 15 minutes , come back then . "
this quy 's like a cigarette commercial .
i will .
not unless they 're crooked ones , looking for the gold .
just stay focused on your work .
it 's the pale sac in there , the one that looks like ...
careful not to pop his liver .
let 's dump him and drive .
this is the only deal you 're gonna get .
leave the bullion where it is and come on out .
you stay in the van , we 'll kill all of you ,
when you drove by the bank .
what do you want ?
so i can thank you face to face
go rob bank robbers .
i need the strap to stop the bleeding .
you want to get yourself a notebook .
it 's already infected your tongue .
juka , what 's that about
they 'll make entry at approximately 2200 hours
why ?
surround the house , take him when he moves ,
i 'd take that as a compliment ...
we win this election and
the kid at the airport ,
come on .
you get the hospital , but that 's all .
hathan , fuck of
do you want me to start on row two ?
yes , boss .
and that 's where it gets complicated .
the next day , they pick up ruan
they 're going to make an example of him ..
because of you .
man can kidnap , kill , rob
and he gets called a legend .
get good marks and all that ?
so you work hard , you do your best .
the only lasting thing about jacob sternwood
i 'm thinking . you put it out there
okay .
yeah .
90 home , kiss your wife .
i was involved the second they pulled the trigger .
you are . i 'm gonna go track down this security guard ,
i mean , you want it new school or old school ?
that 's the way the gospel 's usually nowadays , cyber-styley .
and rob .
i 'll show you fucking old school .
right , wait there .
so what are you saying ?
i 'm saying when i 'm given a new job
this may be nothing ..
they 've all heard that ruan sternwood is apparently
um , what 's the name of the company ?
alright .
but this is actually one of the largest container yards
this is sarah hawlks , leave a message .
have you ever heard of someone called bartnick ?
the way they fired their guns ,
hey , honey .
this is for your benefit , max .
people in this city won 't be
jane , i 'm paid to catch crooks ,
gotta talk to you .
yeah , i can 't understand what you were doing there .
i had information , i acted on it .
maybe he was checking out a lead and needed protection .
but why two officers from separate divisions twinning it ?
what do you mean two officers ?
of course i didn ' .
tacob sternwood was there too
well , that 's not good enough .
i don 't give a fuck what kind of .. it 's fine mate ,
just tell him he 's a fucking moron .
relaxing at a murder scene ?
how did you know i was here ?
i 've been trying to call you , max . i 'm glad you turned up .
yeah , right .
give us two minutes , could you ?
what the fuck ?
deal with him or i fucking will .
walk away , juka .
who killed my son ?
the ones in the club ?
who was she ? was she involved ?
why didn 't you just kill me in that tunnel ?
that 's the guy that focused on me at the club tonight .
i wish you had , nan .
come on , mate .
yeah , why not ?
we know how busy dean 's been keeping himself recently .
how we were the only ones to speak up and voice our disgust .
you were ike a rock .
yeah , you wouldn 't be involved
how 's your son ?
yeah , unfortunately , ruan passed away recently .
ake him down to the punch for a few drinks .
so how do we do this ?
i get terrible migraines . feels like my head 's gonna explode .
you don 't mind if i stay here and relax , do you , iris ?
maybe they can watch calamity jane .
i want to settle things .
when i close this down ..
told you before , i 'm wise to you ..
and you sit there in denial like some fucking royalty
i have to get this speech right with robert .
i hope this pans out for you , okay ?
bult warns can 't be reached .
you broke my fucking arm !
you can 't settle trying to set me up for murder .
right now you 're wanted for the murder of your partner
he was with bartnick and crown
and that compromised the deal .
bartnick and crown went to the hotel looking for their money .
and you suddenly get worried
this can 't just be about money .
robert wiseman , he got it .
tane bad ham ?
i provided some manpower , turned a blind eye , you know .
because you wouldn 't shut up about it .
hey , guys , i 'm frying to cook in here .
no , no , speak up .
zack 's here !
sorry . i really want to hear how sad you are .
sorry she made you come over here on a holiday .
plus , penny told me we 're married ,
can we just get this over with ?
okay .
why won 't you sign it ?
we don 't have any kids .
you know neither of us thought this was real .
of course it was an impersonator .
you married him instead of me ?
sign the papers .
you have been a jerk about this all day .
and the blade high like this ,
once you 've gotten the hang of it ,
nothing to sneeze at .
here , let me show you something .
little boy , are you okay ?
miss ! miss ! he lost his bathing suit !
i 'm fine !
i love your limo !
but , you know , w-we can 't bail on my family again .
plus , cam , this will be fun , too .
that 's a bit direct , but , you know , he might be flattered .
fergus !
just had the worst fight with hugh .
i took a shot at russell crowe in " les mis . "
he has to know .
let 's see . what do we got in here ?
i saw manny take shampoos from the hotel .
then some bigger things .
it makes my heart go fast .
a hair dryer . thanks , buddy .
sonia , what are you doing here ?
we 're sisters . we shouldn 't fight .
you 've been doing it since i was 10 years old
can you be a human being for one second ?
well , that 's just a reflex .
oh , come on . where is that written ?
and then when cam thought
gloria , we can 't sit around doing nothing . call sonia .
why would i make an exchange ? we have all the leverage .
what is she gonna do ? raise manny ?
there 's got to be a better way .
why does she want your sauce business , anyway ?
my late aunt
because papa loved me more ?
oh , my god . i guess so .
when you lose a love like that at such a young age ,
listen , if you want the hot-sauce business ,
i want to give you something that is very precious to me .
it 's something that i should have given you a long time ago
but seeing how happy you make my grandson ,
now , let 's put this someplace safe .
do you want to do this ?
you know , it was nice of bernadette to offer ,
if you were in charge of her project ,
aren 't you always saving it 's about the work ,
plus , i 'd be working for bernadette .
that 's what makes you a good employee .
it 's just such a bummer .
you sure you don 't want me to call her ?
but , you know , just , ugh , why ?
i remember .
and now , instead of losing our jobs ,
looks like my wife left me a month too soon .
what was his name again ?
sheldon , super-asymmetry is your paper ..
mm , actually , the nobel committee has sometimes favored
yeah , that 's not gonna happen .
this discovery belongs to amy and me .
how long has she been like this ?
come to me
what do you know of what a spook actually does ?
your answer .
it 's not that simple .
sometimes it 's just ... dust on a witch 's fingers .
your master was in love with a witch once .
close your eyes .
a failed spook and a half-witch ..
well , my mother taught me how to steal .
tricked her .
i thought that prison would hold her for eternity .
now everyone she kills in her wake is my burden .
this is rebecca
you may do as you wish with the boy , my darling
beyond the forest .. pendle mountain . we have three days .
dependable as death you are .
a boggart .
it belongs to my queen . how did you get it ?
don 't get up . i 'm fine . i 'm fine .
what :
what is this thing ? that thing ? the umbran stone .
makes their illusions seem more real
but it was stolen from her by another witch .
are you telling me that my mother is a witch ?
a witch 's son who is a spook 's apprentice .
must account for your visions .
we have a job to do .
you could have the whole place to yourself .
teddy bear could have his own room .
go , go , go ! race mama !
you can 't find a clearer station than that ?
i don 't know how to make it clearer to you .
you don 't make me anything .
shelley , let 's just ... .
the receptionist has gotta be around here somewhere .
hey .
charlie .
nikilki , what 's wrong ? where 's charlie ?
what the fuck ?
the receptionist . his face was ripped to pieces .
the mod now have confirmed fighter jets
they know there was something on board .
something like that fucking thing out there .
you think the government hasn 't known about this for years ?
whatever it is , it 's out there , on the loose ,
what do you think it wants ?
i can 't hear it anymore . think it 's gone ?
the shutters are locked .
wait . remember ..
all the power systems and wiring are in the basement .
well , there 's no way i 'm going back out there .
have you got weapons ?
but i do know where to find some .
but that still means we have to go out there .
ay . what you need to do is you need to get to the far end .
charlie . look , about shelley , things like this just happen .
listen ,
charlie .
it 's a dead end . it 's a dead end !
i mean , it might work for the japanese
i feel terrible .
i deliberately tried to sabotage stuart 's date with penny .
you completely screwed up your karma , dude .
it 's not superstition .
oh , no , thanks . i have coffee .
um , i really don 't want to talk about it .
no . they can 't just cancel a show like alphas .
firefly did a movie to wrap things up .
heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season
ah , don 't .
i just .. i want this done .
that man was clearly a cowboy .
why do they keep hanging up on me ?
you know , sheldon , sometimes people seek the comfort
okay .
oh , that 's nonsense .
i don 't care how they end .
there 's a whole field of behavioral neuroscience
use it to your advantage .
well , that doesn 't seem fair .
no , it 's not .
so take what 's in that blog and use it to get her pants off .
why couldn 't you just say the blog is like
oh , look how cute your little doggy is .
if i give the right command in german ,
that 's quite an impressive layout , isn 't it ?
" let 's box it up . "
okay , sheldon , make a wish and blow out the candles .
now your wish can 't come true .
i didn 't think anybody actually read it .
i spent hours digging around online .
and your diabetic aunt seems
and i ..
rai , i didn 't say " feminine " was a bad thing .
i do have a-pretty balls-to-the-wall
you set me up !
i could have been arrested !
you stole some shit , you got away with it .
you really miss me ?
like , how much ? like , on a scale of one to 10 ?
you 're not gonna try and kiss me now , are you ?
ooh !
before state , coach gave us key cards
it 's fine , don 't worry about it .
i don 't make the rules .
i heard that .
i didn 't jump , calvin .
well , you go first .
it 's not what she wants .
not like she sees them .
well , he. he seems to be helping .
it 's not him that i 'm worried about .
of course if i buy them ,
oh , no . you have to go .
i thought i was a teeny-tiny wildebeest .
wait . what are you talking about ?
she could ferret out priya 's tactics ,
no . once these puppies touch the ground
good news : the wildebeest is in the curry .
bernadette is with priya and leonard .
commence operation " priya wouldn 't wanna be-ya . "
what 's the word i 'm looking for ?
she 's also dating an astronaut .
yeah . but leonard 's impressive , too .
i 'm such a basket case , i can 't even talk to a woman
i have a big decision to make , and i 'm scared .
a friend at the school of pharmacology
fascinating . what 's in it ?
some sort of beta-blocker attached to a molecule
that 's not the point .
i 'm a scientist .
i 'm afraid if i take this , i might lose
good golly , penny , your whimsy is boundless .
i think they 're on to me .
calm down . everything 's going to be okay .
bernadette , i 'm putting you on speakerphone .
in the bathroom .
what 's the problem ?
you texted me penny 's dating an astronaut .
auto-correct must 've changed it .
all right , look , just forget about the astronaut .
look , just find out what 's up with this trip to india .
don 't you quit on us !
it was an architect !
you 're a good friend .
that 's what i strive to emulate .
can i help you ?
india .
it 's a beautiful country . you 'd love it .
uh , okay , sure . why not ?
there 's no need to interact with me .
what 's he observing ?
look , joe , there 's no monsters anywhere .
are you sure ?
they 're not like the evil spirits ,
no , no , nothing , baby .
look , my window 's open .
impossible .
my monogrammed money clip .
i needed to get it before mom saw .
david sedaris is coming to barnes and noble
i-i am not in competition with you .
n-no .
connect the dots , you dummy .
my hair is lustrous like a lion 's mane .
no , the opposite ! i 'm pregnant !
the family didn 't want me to get back together with beau
oh , pam , i-i had no idea .
oh , all of them .
she 's pregnant !
hey ! hey ! cut it out !
is it on me ? !
call 811 .
call 911 .
pamela , why didn 't you tell me ?
i didn 't want to disappoint you .
you 'll be happy i did .
you wanted to make an entrance . i get it .
when he tries to tell you he used to be cool ,
well , this is not for me . this is for the baby .
i 'm sorry .
hey . bernadette 's water broke !
you have got to be kidding me !
stuart , stop driving like an old man .
i 'm not an old man !
here comes another one .
all right , hang on .
howard and bernadette 's kid
i ... i dreamed ...
george is going to die in the army if we don 't stop him .
who said that was george ?
meredith . so ...
that 's not geroge .
he wrote in my hand .
what does that
you know , in my hand. he wrote " 007 . "
joe ?
i 'm telling you , he squeezed my hand .
you don 't get to talk anymore .
i could 've sworn it was george .
he 's not answering .
i 'll check .
george o 'malley jumped in front of a bus today .
so i 'm not gonna allow you doctors to stand here .
there are lives we can save .
so let 's go .
and you , i take it , must be olivia .
olivia is a brunette .
i 'm sophie .
no , thank you . just a little wine , if you have any .
oh , are those little cakes ?
they 're delicious .
oh , leave her alone , stanley .
do you have a telephone i could use ?
you 've always been so certain about the world , stanley .
we really don 't know .
the goldfish doesn 't understand
told brice i 'd be late
do you have a , uh , handkerchief
when did you first realize you had this extraordinary gift ?
well , and you saw it as a way to make money ?
eh , but it 's astounding
goodness ! i found that rather exhilarating
i can 't believe i found this place .
i came here as a boy .
we just got a little wet . it 's water .
well , you know what my thoughts are ?
that we 'll get married at summer 's end at the donaldsons ' yacht .
and then after the wedding ,
that 's pretty swanky stuff for a girl from kalamazoo .
you 'll run your foundation . you 'll be world-famous .
you know , my mom has been so happy since you 've been here .
shall i sell the beach house on the tersey shore ?
i really didn 't want to .
go on
i knew ic !
no , i really didn 't believe it .
i 'm so relieved to know that i was the only one .
how wonderful you make me feel
i 'm too excited to lock myself away .
brice is away for the week , in paris .
i 'm sure swimming isn 't your favorite pastime .
just need to buy a bathing suit ,
live dangerously , i say . you only live once .
you are a much better swimmer
to be born , to have committed no crime
yes , wei ling crawford .
good , splendid .
no ... well , yes , it is a ..
it 's much more than that , much more .
it 's philosophy , it 's religion .
he is pushing me very hard .
i mean , it 'd be logical .
you know , stanley ,
hmm . well , you could 've fooled me .
and you do have agreeable features ,
i mean , even you just said i have agreeable features .
provided the light hits you just so .
just in case i ever need to look my best for a job interview ?
of course i am .
do you have a date ?
i 'm going with the most charming woman in the south of france .
i like her .
maybe you and i can even have a dance together .
ah , your mental vibrations told you my feet are killing me
aunt vanessa ?
i 'm overwhelmed , sophie .
that 's more like it .
tell me , um , stanley .
have you not , in the .
well , i 've already told you ,
t mean as a woman .
what an odd question .
well , i was always certain you were not of my sex ,
i mean , comparatively .
you do understand , i 'm seriously considering
you don 't see it as
far beyond what you could hope , given your trivial resume
and most of your time will be spent with your ..
so the time that we 've spent together ,
you imagined that you and i ...
i mean , you 've conquered my mind .
i just thought , in the time that we had spent together
don 't misunderstand me . i .. i .
can you believe the little medium has grown fond of me ?
no , no , i mean .. i mean , she 's emotionally taken with me .
but you 're both spoken for .
well , it seems you 've given the matter some thought .
yes , to be sure .
come , i 've got to drive back to provence ,
i came to unmask her , as i have done countless others ,
know all the tricks .
what are her plans for the future ?
how does it feel to be wrong
so , it is fair to say that you feel
but it would appear that perhaps ,
it 's gonna be a world-class foundation .
i came at once , but she stumped me ,
and damned if he isn 't her biggest fan .
i have some seriously distressing news .
your aunt 's been in a serious automobile accident .
she 's in critical condition at the hospital .
jacques .
this is stanley .
so , how 's she doing ? what 's happening ?
oh , she 's in the operating room now .
so what do you think ?
at this moment , it 's touch-and-go .
you ... you can wait there , if you want .
is that right ?
oh , stanley !
you can imagine how anxious we were about your aunt vanessa .
me ? i didn 't even know .
if i had known ,
and , " all 's well that ends well . "
but now , after years of trailing in his wake ,
thow did
it 's a trick , sophie .
my reputation will suffer ,
've .
and you enjoyed life for once .
and we had some laughs together ,
sitting in your room and shuffling cards in front of a mirror ?
well , i started reading that book
think about it , stanley ,
and you won 't forgive me ?
only god can forgive you .
precisely my point .
" what doesn 't kill me makes me stronger . "
nevertheless , i think he was wrong .
i 've had another idea for our honeymoon .
i 've always wanted to visit bora bora .
some things need to be smoothed over .
yes , of course . yes .
i bet you 'll be glad to get back to london
you 're a great admirer of darwin 's .
and of course , you must miss olivia .
such elegance and style .
we 're ideally suited .
and she 's quite attractive , to boot .
a very handsome couple indeed .
as you would say .
of course i love her .
me ? i never mentioned sophie .
sophie baker ?
exactly . that wretch .
well , you might .
the very idea of you and that specious american telepathic .
you , a creature of reason . a man of intellect .
certainly not trivial .
and she 's hardly in the same class as olivia .
olivia is a person of accomplishment and charm .
i regretted what i was doing
and i accept your forgiveness .
well , then just say it and go ,
that 's only because i fooled you
and as far as what i can offer you ,
i saw your arm . looks really cool .
i am not supposed to be in here , but i snuck in here like a ninja .
she ate some bad fish yesterday , so. yeah
oh , sorry , got to take this . they are wondering if i can get some more info .
who ? what ?
they are experts on zombies . they live in america .
so they can come here ? just tell them to come right now to get the zombies .
come on . you can do it .
can i have my chocolate now ? there is no chocolate , kid
i got to get out .
it 's not what it looks like .
hello ?
bobby , uhh ..
is bobby there ?
and we will be heading your way shortly .
well , umm ...
do you mean our parents ? yes , our parents , but ..
got it
it 's time to go hunting .
not shoot mr. olsen . you shoot the dog !
boring .
what are you looking for ?
nice , huh ? do not touch the exhibit .
i hit it right in the eye . oh my god , oh my god .
first zombie scuad kill .
cheese ..
oh , we spoke on the phone . i am daniel . this is blake and monica .
we tracked your iphone , of course .
what did you find out ? what do the creatures want ?
this is insane !
the force is strong with this one .
that sounds basically impossible .
yes , we need someone to attract their attention .
who knows these swamps and can move through them without getting stuck .
we 're getting close .
i don 't think that would help .
then i could get us out of here .
the rest in the garage with some ice cubes .
brief the guys . send photos to all the cops here in talvik .
odor and color .
for once we will shoot at something other that seagulls .
i mean , say we actually manage to wake these russians back to life .
i don 't know what 's gonna happen . but judging based on him ?
hopefully .
i 've seen a thousand zombie movies , and this is not in any of them .
look , i mean , if we are gonna go up against a battalion of nazi zombies ,
or what he did . we have to kill hi
herzog killed stavarin and 50 of his men here .
ieow do we do this ?
i put my hand on his head .
master !
ie was first seen here
then he appears to be heading south . perhaps there .
a gang dressed as germans going crazy out there ?
and suddenly we have ragnarok on our doorstep .
there is no one here . we have sent them away .
since you can 't complete your mission ,
don 't you get a bitter feeling when somebody you thought were dead
troops !

i hereby do solemnly swear

once they know ? but they 're not gonna know .
everything 's gonna be all right . it 's all good .

i just felt you should know what he was saying .
obviously i said no .
would you mind , um , cleaning this up for me ?
this is serious , karl . he asked angie to spy on me .

this money is blood soaked . the blood of innocents .
imtiaz , what have you done ?
sir , the pakistani saw me opening tawfeeq 's bag
you mean ' you ' ?
i have a lot of emotional baggage
nice , really nice .
hey. rose .
she took it so well at the beginning .
civilized is out
now she 's got delayed rage .
she was being big before putting on a brave face .
like 3 men who 'd be married to those ladies in the ball gowns
just like when you had pete you remember ?
but you will love me later when there 's virtually no scar .
three gentlemen in a limousine
oh , no .
which is across town .
we can do that ?
and , uh . if i were you , i would insist .
the good grey ?
and i 'll throw in o 'malley .
phil ?
the limo hit a patch of ice .
i can 't feel my legs .
oh , sir , dr. hahn is working on multiple crash injuries
to check on my other patients .
hello ? vincent ?
every 30 seconds , her memory resets every 30 seconds
how you doing ?
i know , it 's just .

so we consider him a good teacher right ?
there 's a problem with the insurance .
i know , michaeli called them and the credit card company
i ... i don 't understand .
is there something i can do ?
i ... i don 't .
if you can just tell me .
i 'll talk to billing and see what i can do .
it 's stuck .
you 're a little mean to george un-unnecessarily mean
why are you talking to me ?
you thought that makes us friends ?
he 's not my boyfriend .
you do .
shut up
please .
shut up .
no . why ?
oh the softer side of alex .
he 's stable but still critical .
this is dr. yang .
i will keep you posted .
where am i ?
what 's going on ?
without my consent ? no , i don 't think so .
get out of my patient 's room !
listen you arrogant little
oh gentle gentle , gentle
how 's mr.kenner ?
i 'm doing my best hold still .

did you mean what you said about me and derek ?
i 'm impaled a
that is unprecedented in the meredith chronicles .
fine .
got you .
goes with the story of how i cut my hand .
i-i didn 't say anything .
okay okay
he 's down to 90 degrees .
i think it 's too low
do they recommend lido or amiodarone ?
all right.looks like we have some warming to do .
um it kinda looks like it 's hitting nothing ?
because it 's hitting nothing !
we just couldn 't bring him back .
none of you .
and you walk around this hospital like it 's your god-given right to be here .
you are here because i allow it .
so what , you don 't make mistakes ?
today i killed a man because i couldn 't do a stitch .
it 's about something . it 's not about being the best . it 's about saving lives .
and i don 't know everything . nobody does .
and the next time . i don 't make that mistake again .
mistakes are how you learn .
my head. hurts .
betty you and vincent were in a car accident .
no , no , please .
it hurts . what happened ?
it happens . people make mistakes .
and i think you 're off to a good start .
he was ready an hour ago .
fine .
it 's tomorrow .
i 'm sorry about the hand .
not to me they don 't , or they didn 't before you existed for me .
every doctor in this hospital wanted me in their o.r .
and now i 'm the crazy girl out of fatal attraction
you 're never at a loss for words with your patients .
you don 't seem to have any trouble letting me know how you feel ,
when i like somebody . i make sure they know it .
what if he doesn 't like me back ?
what 's ... what am i doing here ?
did something happen ?
oh , right .
you should ditch this place and go for the adventure .
yeah . yeah , it does
uh . dr. yang took good care of me excellent care .
i also heard a story that you constructed an o r. table
you have to be innovative everywhere .
i don 't have anything to compare it with.i ...
so you 're freaking out , too ?
yeah . i don 't do therapy
well , not much , i expect , unless i can convince you
no , thank you , sir .
more a matter of content . you don 't seem to care much for our profession .
i 've read your books . neither do you .
you got it right in kentucky blood .
but cold denver morning , you got it wrong .
look , that wasn 't my fault . all right ?
now , this town doesn 't need that . it needs to heal . it needs to forget .
well , there 's a missing girl involved here .
then i guess we should just let it go , huh ?
something like this ... you can never explain something like this .
now , we did our job . you 'll see that .
if writing true crime has taught me one thing ,
well , i 'm gonna go out on a limb
oh , and ... i find this to be in extremely bad taste .
he wanted an autograph , but he left his copy at home .
yeah .
no , not yet .
no , i thought i 'd set up my office first and get started .
just an hour or two .
oh , god , i don 't know . it could be a long one .
it should be in my backpack .
oh , fuck .
trevor , don 't walk away from me . ashley , close the door .
i 'll tell you again . i wasn 't thinking .
you wanna be treated like an adult , but you don 't act like one .
you don 't know what you 're talking about .
go to your room !
fine .
i didn 't say you were a .... you know .
i 've taken my fair share of forensic science courses .
look .... .
but if you want me to run interference for you while you get this worked out ,
it 's my home , mr. oswalt .
all right . come here .
i don 't know . that 's what i 'm hoping to find out .
maybe .
yeah , or his 60s .
i don 't know .
toxicology reports , some cases the killer drugged his victims .
well , they couldn 't tell for sure .
here he used a tree branch to do the heavy lifting .
my god , what on earth possessed you to move here ?
this place came on the market . it was a steal .
so what trevor drew last week , that happened here ?
the previous owners of this home were hung from a tree in our backyard ?
really ?
and play dates for her kids ..
it was fun !
well , they look fine to me .
same time next week ?
the loved ones who traveled alongside us ..
and those waiting for us on the road ahead
let me see . oh .
oh , come on . trot her on out .
actually , l think i 'm starting to feel pretty zen
i can 't even blame him for hating me
i 'm with you . carry on .
somewhere down the line ,
i 'm fine .
oh . well , i mean , when two people split up ,
i 'm sorry .
look , are you sure this is what you want to do ?
you 're like the first 14 chapters .
i 'm gonna be honest .
it was just awful .
his mother and her friend were there with champagne .
well , there 's something comfortable about george .
oh , and best of all , he loves the opera .
no harm , no foul .
we 're two old friends who suddenly find themselves single .
a little less lonely .
i 'll be back on friday to pick your guys up .
yeah , um , before that happens ...
she 's getting so big
please. tell me the kids didn 't see it .
right before you took off your bra .
oh , norma . it 's okay .
you 're just having fun.lf 's nothing to be ashamed of .
at one point we actually talked
thank you for being so open-minded .
guess i owe you an apology .
i 'm still gonna need some proof .
what happens in nine months ?
now just so you know , stan ,
well , don 't wanna wait too long .
well , for starters , he knows the last thing
but you should know that .
dr. goldfine has other concerns about us being together ,
i 'll agree with dr . goldfine on one thing .
really ?
i 'll talk to dr . goldfine about it tomorrow .
not good .
okay . we can 't panic.caleb is scared .
which yards haven 't you checked yet ?
oh , dear . what 's wrong ?
well , that was a waste of time .
did you hear the big news ?
karl and i are back together
there 's some stuff that i have to say ,
whatever it was that you said to him really helped .
gaby , if i make it any tighter ,
i can 't have these girls thinking i 'm pregnant .
trust me . they 're merciless .
when i decided to marry carlos ,
tell gabrielle i 'm sorry i backed out of the show .
helen ! helen , you 're here .
there 's a special place in hell for people like you .
you 're an adult . take some responsibility !
she is wearing a dignified classic ,
edie britt , everyone !
yes . if you like .
you seem angry at my good fortune and i thought we were friends .
well , i was actually just teasing . i thought you 'd see that .
well , it will , if i build it using the finest claltsmen in the land .
prime minister , we need to discuss who will go to the french with the peace treaty proposal .
so they will give in to us .
i upheld my party together , as we the country
the french were chastened but not defeated , harley .
make them sue for peace with broken hearts and begging backs .
sweet and right .
we must take it to the queen .
i liked your father .
then i guess he did .
when i was fifteen , my father lost me in a card game .
this one here .
lady marlborough .
yes , lady marlborough .
must the duck be here ?
horatio is a prize worth stealing , it is not leaving my side .
and how are we going to pay for this ?
this is madness .
she relies on you and your love of england to holds the tories together .
the love of your country ?
look , the dead pile up , as do the resentments .
i grieve them all .
in my heart , a scar for each ,
there is always a price to pay .
throw .
when it crosses your eye , pull the trigger .
perfect !
are you following ?
you seemed to be following me , sir .
that was you i saw on the horse that morning ?
where would i get a horse ?
perhaps it was you .
it 's like a monster attacking me .
i don 't think so , your majesty .
the queen and lady marlborough are to race lobsters . and then eat them .
queen is going to announce for the doubling of the land holders tax to parliament .
i don 't think she 's certain of it though .
and the fields would have run with blood , as the
agian to our queen ,
you have become close to abigail .
it is such a shame but ' ve had to dismiss her for theft .
she 's my servant , she 's not dismissed .
did you not hear what i said ?
yes .
you will dismiss her .
i like it when she puts her tongue inside me .
it 's good for you .
what if i should fall asleep and slip under ?
oh , then i shall die happy .
do not scratch at her .
mr morley .
how handsome you are , mr freeman .
perhaps i was not making a point .
perhaps some malformation of my heart .
i must take control of my circumstance .
so kind .
anne .
oh , we should ask people .
this is not how matters of state are dealt with .
would you leave marlborough exposed ?
do not shout at me . i am the queen .
is the queen not riding today ?
i have thought on the terms of our friendship .
i will get you an audience with the queen if you ask her a favour for me .
harley you did not need me as an enemy .
true .
the war with the french will bleed us dry even if we win .
the people hate the war , you realize
no , she has not .
of course .
i must talk to you of your maid also .
i believe that is her name .
she 's just a maid .
we need
this cannot wait .
is it a bit like going late to your party ?
but if it 's going badly , you cannot save it ,
i am sorry prime minister , passing thought .
i have told you before .
she probably went back to south hampton .
to plan what ?
i am as hard as a rock and it is our wedding night .
in his newspaper , the next day ,
and for you .
you 'd do that ?
do you not wish to know what i 've decided ?
the queen requested the return of your key .
where is she ?
you must stop it godolphin .
indeed , but he would have launched us into a bloody
a new era of peace and prosperity , a new day , a door to a new future ,
thank you all .
i shall leave a gap in the conversation for you to remedy that .
this cannot be all of it .
don 't lean on me .
perhaps it was lost , or eaten mice in the long journey .
yeah , they 're helping me get pregnant .
yep , he 's poked more famous people than john mayer .
tell you what , i 'm gonna do what i used to do
max , do you think randy invited me to dinner
we have to leave now to take sophie to the healer
i can 't move any faster .
well , since drinking that hot sauce ,
unless it 's a diaper full of ice .
okay , okay , remember that party bus
surprise !
i 'm feeling suicidal , and i 've always wanted
you 're getting two poles for the price of one .
well , you haven 't seen
if you gonna puke , please aim for the floor .
there 's ladies in the bus not wearing penis helmets .
here , girls .
and you wonder why you 're single .
and there 's the taco place we had to eat at afterwards
and there 's the parking spot where i put randy behind me .
if so , i 'd like to hit the affleck-garner house .
we 'd make a right at that super ripped homeless guy ,
he really liked you too .
oh , please , spirits , put a baby in me !
oh , this is not a bill .

more croutons for us !
oh , sophie , it 's just you .
look , i stole it again . where 's oleg ?
a high fashion model was giving me the eye .
uh , han , i believe i 'll stay here .

well , she knows more than she 's letting on .
hey , you guys have been here a while .
max !

and then worse , no one buys me ?

down over there !
we have a young male with multiple gunshot wounds .
blood pressure 's dropping . sixty-thirty .
can you tell me what 's on it ?
i sent it out so people will understand what i 've done .
we need to know if there are more attacks planned .
so , i needed to do emergency surgery on him .
there are several bullet fragments close to his brain stem .
that means if he survives ,
my parents divorced amicably when i was very young .
i maintain a close relationship with my mother .
i was too focused on my career ,
my mother had nothing to do with this . she 's not relevant .
how many children do you have , mr. lippestad ?
yes , of course .
so , he buys 900 kilos of fertilizer and aluminium nitrate ,
when he attacked them , he attacked us all .

i 'm going to make sure you and your family rot in hell .
this will be led by one of oslo 's leading lawyers , mrs. alexandra gerig .
this inquiry is of vital importance .
if we fail to do so , the terrorist will surely win .
it was from the office .
yes ?
two or three years .
that could be fatal .
do you have any questions for me , viljar ?
i 've allowed the families to take control .
i have to prove that these attacks meant something .
i have to finish what i 've started , and standing up in that court ..
that 's the whole point .
he wants to change his defense .
has he given any reason ? i mean , why ?
and he knows the consequences .
the psychiatric assessment was clear .
how do we get around that ?
just tell me what i need to do .
i want to begin to explore to what extent government was aware
the security services told me they had no warnings ,
we have discovered that mr. breivik 's purchase of chemicals
that was not what i was told , madam chair .
you can turn to tab three .
were you aware of these discussions ?
mr. breivik , you told the police that this organization
i don 't know . i get a good idea , like why don 't i write about my dad ?
who wants to read about , " he was disappointed in me ...
he needs to go outside a lot , breaks up my day . that 's why i 'm not writing
can i have bobby now ?
calvin ...
that he would help me meet people .
that he would be awesome and we 'd take hikes and stuff

i can 't write . okay .
of the new york times best seller list , uh , for several months .
and , uh , how can i go back in time and be him ? "

we are lucky to have him around .
phenomenal , man . just brilliant . thank you . thanks .
calvin . hi .

i don 't know how or why ...
and i like it .

i 'm not seeing things .
i told him when she was a character . he won 't understand .
harry , don 't laugh at me .
some girl wanted to get close to you , somehow got her hands on what you wrote .
if it does , then you 're right and this is a fucking miracle .

yeah . actually , my parents died when i was a baby in an accident ..
i guess the habit stuck .
mom 's gonna fucking freak . whoa , you can 't tell mom .
... you can 't tell anybody . not mom , not susie . no one .
ruby loves giving blow jobs .
women are mysterious creatures . i still look at susie like :
for men everywhere ..
i was wondering if you 're gonna make it up this weekend .

calvin , she is so intuitive . what ? what ? what ?
and the bricks come from an old catholic school that was torn down .
stairway , bedroom .

and she came back .
you could send me postcards . i love getting mail .
cool .
you were always asking me to make plans for us . i did .
i don 't want to fight about this . fine , great ! let 's ignore it , then .
and i think that 's wonderful . we 've all noticed it .
sally made a really interesting choice using that big tease ..
she 's not afraid to be bold .
everything 's been so up and down lately , you know ?
mavbe i should talk to someone .
uh . dr. rosenthal .
i thought we were talking about you .
mavbe you 're right . mavbe i just need to get out .

you think i gave a shit if you were famous ?

you can keep your underwear on if you like .
writing is sensual . it 's , uh .
oh , really ?
your pen ? ... ike a lightsaber .
we , uh.we thought we 'd take a dip .
you have all these rules and you don 't tell me what they are .
and then you get to be disappointed with me ?
so i wrote it down .
ruby .
you were living in my house .
to tell her :
i couldn 't see you when you were here
a human being has been created out of ink , paper and the imagination . "
any writer can attest ..
she came to me wholly herself .
i can write more for you though , elton .
great . that 'd be good .
my real name 's reggie dwight .
yeah , it sounds like a cowboy name .
all i ever wanted to be was a cowboy , you see .
oh , yeah ?
right , i 'm not having a mess in this house .
and there isn 't one now .
commitments , tours , etcetera .
taking care of things .
you realize i 've got a contract with elton .

you 're breaking your poor mum 's heart .
so 's you can go buy a new one .
when i 've given up so much for you .
your father for a start .
you know , i don 't live my life in black and white .
you know , i am so sick of running away from who i am .
or pleasure . in fact , why am i apologizing for it ?
and i 've taken every drug known to man .
and all those legends who were welcoming us in .
when did you give up ?
whenever i needed you most ,
i have worked my balls off
for years .
it 's me who doesn 't have a life .
thanks , no . i don 't really do organised .

why should we ?
i don 't deny her sincerity ,
a cattle market ? well , that 's an unappealing analogy .

because if you fall flat on your face down this hole or that hole on the night ,
that is correct .
alphabetical order , please . come on , hurry , hurry .
get her off the stage , clive .

on the night , this area will be shut down ,
we 'd infiltrate the theatre .
a planned invasion .
why not ? that 's where the cameras will be .
they 're turning oppression into a spectacle .
we 'd still demonstrate outside ?
who 'd be prepared to go inside ?
we 'd buy tickets .
and you lot would .. you 'd have to blend in .
oh , i love them .

i think we 're gonna win .
the doctor wouldn 't give you birth control .

paddy 's here , nicky 's here
sir , this is all about the seurat .
i need a full surveillance kit , i need manpower and i need a gun .
ok . no gun .
let 's take it down , you 're a little testy .
and let 's just say , hypothetically ,
a sort of " sorry for fucking you over " money . huh ?
robin .
maybe ' cause you just knocked over a nine-year-old little chinese girl .
you never prey upon the virtuous or the poor .
and you never , ever betray your family !
there 's always an angle with you , man .
you think this is about money , crunch ?
think again .
just because he says he 's sorry doesn 't make him a changed man .
wow ! she 's good .
no . crunch needs this .
oh . well , what i understand is that ,
take care .
what did ya have in mind ?
that 's where the motorcycle kicks in
in and out in 4.25 minutes .

turner , monet , vermeer , those guys kept my eyes open .
i only started getting into trouble when i wanted to possess it .
money
who you can trust .
not because i want to get you or your brother in trouble .
let me ask you a question .
i will
looking good , sam .
i 'm not going to fuckin ' prison ! i 'm not cut out for that shit !
these wet noodles will prevent very few prison rapes .
you gotta trust me . look , ever since i 've been back ,
ok , my turn .
all right , guy just landed and we got a little problem .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
because of crunch 's record , interpol will be brought in .
what the hell am i looking at ?
and on the day , what about interpol ?
seriously , what are we doing ? why do i listen to you ?
the border . they 're at the border .
pick up . come on , pick up .
atta boy , crunch !
yeah , the old days where you threw me to the cops ?
uh , uh , uh . now , now , gentlemen .
well , you 're progressive .
well , you better get your best brando on , hoss , ' cause we need you .
come here . you got two lines :
oh . will you ?
i cannot even be in the same room as you !
i got an idea .
i fail to see how that makes us rich
and we can get guy to duplicate a book for each one of them .
the news hits the paper and boom .
each one thinks they have the original .
well , yeah , i didn 't mind predator two .
you can 't go wrong . no .
oh , yeah ! thank you .
i 'm never doing this shit again !
what the fuck is this ! come on !

it cost guy ten grand to fake one .
ten grand a book , that 's a hundred grand . i can front it .

this could have been big .
damn it .
a million per book . ten million bucks , guys .
no , no , no . let 's stick with ten . let 's not get greedy here .
today . now .
i just need money .
oh , no , no , no , no , no .
you just made one for ten thousand .
and if you want these to pass the carbon dating and the professional scrutiny ,
with our buyers , most certainly .
all right , look .
oh , no , no , no , no , man . i 'm not doing that .
if we pull this off , you can buy ten of ' em .
listen , i gotta think about it . i wanna run it by lola .
don 't talk to me about lost time , nicky .
ah , you waste no time .
ok . great , we 're all here .
during that time period paddy will have made the sales ,
in a month 's time , we 'll contact amsterdam ,
all right .
they 'll pass carbon dating , expert analysis , everything .
they 'll just need to look convincing
why .. why bother working that lot at all ?
this way , you and i can split it two ways
yeah , well , let me tell you something about family .
yeah , but then he delivers his books
i won 't be around .
fuck !
olga something
have you ... have you seen paddy ?
did you fuckin ' see paddy ?
what about the gospel ? did customs ask you to look at the gospel ?
did they ask you to look at it ?
and that is the story of the theft of the mona lisa .
nicky boy ,
all i did was drop off a sculpture .
i just needed to plant the idea and let his imagination do the rest .
i 'm not a cop . but these guys are .
look who we have here .
" model , rear-view , " 1887 .
uncle paddy could come up with ten buyers easily .
you see , all he needed was the news of the theft .
this is all about the seurat .
we still need four hundred and fifty .
we know what you were doing .
oh , you were breathing , all right .
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
i 'm always trembling .
we just want to know how you got invited .
so there 's another game next week .
who 's in it ?
how do we get invited ?
and you didn 't tell us ?
i thought we were friends .
no , we wouldn 't ! i told you when i was

of course you wouldn 't wear a shoe on your head .
a shoe belongs on your foot
i belong on the head , you belong on the foot .

if you look very deep into the eyes ,
yes , tanya . i do .

i 'm not your friend . and why would i ?
education ?
i 'll miss our late night phone chats .
all with only one arm .
what 's the matter ?
you see those cables ?
die !
i think it is easier for someone to survive on this train ..
if they have some level of insanity .
we need to maintain the proper balance of anxiety and fear ..
if we don 't have that , we need to invent it .
sit down !
now , i got two bodies back at the trailer .
who knew about the buy ?
if i tell you , he 's gonna kill me .

you 've got two alternatives .
and we put him away for a long time .
detective , i want to see what my client just signed .
i said i want to see what my client just signed .
you had no business having him sign an affidavit without me there .
look , the affidavit is on file at the clerk 's office .
but as for me
guards ! get me out of here .
that you truly understand the meaning of death .
but you know what those misfits did , the first chance they got ?
this country is built on the barrel of a gun ,
we are the poor with guns .
death before dishonor .
or just simply freakin ' stupidity ?
get him on his feet .
we 've got cops .
you want me to say i killed ' em ?
to turn a blind eye from some of his business affairs .
a very selfish thing to do .
well for your grandson 's sake , you better hope they do .
it 's best served cold
no , i was thinking about that other one .
an eye for an eye .
you go back and get him !
ge out of the car ! get out of the car !
hey , man . ruck ! i 've got to go to the hospital , man .
don 't shoot . don 't shoot
so bring frank in and let him clear his name .

if you have any explaining , you can do it at the station .
raise your hands , detective .
don 't move . let 's go to the station .
do i trust him ?

it 's all good , homie .
i 'm just doing mine .
how much did he pay you to kidnap my grandson ?
i tell you what , man .
we could help you out , but uh .

and you were always the oldest , so you 'd end up babysitting
shit . i 'm sorry .
i know it was hard on you guys .
yes , sir , i saw it all .
you played your hardest . that 's what matters .
okay , listen .
i 'll get the generator going
robert , you 're right . that 's your job . so , find a radio or tv
okay .
don 't go outside unless it 's an absolute emergency .

your livelihood is our utmost concern
the weapons and ammo , get it all .
yeah

holy shit !
i can 't . this is stupid .

not if it meant putting everyone else 's ass on the line .
mait 's been gone for days .
what are you doing here , matty ?
okay . do what you want .
the chair is against the wall .

you here to help them out ?
we got clean water and bandages
i was afraid of that .
it went defunct .
far from it .
a lot of this country is still free and up for a fight .
we 're only 50 , 60 miles from the border .
and other places , too , swinging back our way .
texas-mexican border has been burning for weeks .
god damn it , do what i say , robert !
i 'll catch up . go !
no . no , no . everything 's great .
no , we 're having a wonderful time .
what ? your dad ?
hang on , watch me back . i can 't flip you over anymore .

i see you in there . get out here now !
oh , no .

l .... . i like him .
alright . it 's none of my business .

he tried to buy me off with shoes .
well , you know if you ever need anything , i 'm always here .

good morning ! have fun today . hi !
no , no , no , no , no , no !
somebody secure the whale !
that dog 's out of control .
dad ...

no penguins means no sanctuary .
well , there might not be anything here for me .
i will fight for the penguins ,
you 're not a penguin , dad .
look at the camera so i can see you .
you 're a good-looking young fella , aren 't you ?
that 's a boy . that 's a boy .
what ? what 's that ?
only a week until the penguin count .
give us your hand , love . there you go .
did you have a dust-up with a fox , mate ?
looks like we 're in business .
maybe , but we should talk about
but you can 't just give up . breeding season 's soon , right ?
i 'm just .. i 'm not ruling anything out .
if bradley 's projects in town go well ,
wait , you mean like ... moving away ?
but what about the penguins ?
sometimes you just have to trust that
like ... ?
so , emily came to see me about oddball .
this might be my undoing as a mayor ,
when i point out how exposed the entire whale development is
i didn 't become mayor for nothing .
but be warned , when they 're forced
no-one approves of me , anyway .
this is a major setback .
don 't put this on me .
we 'll , er ... we 'll find oddy .
we can still fix this , sweetheart .
sweetheart , go help jack and zoe , ok ?
what am i sticking around here for ?
it 's been a , er .. it 's been a while
actually , i .. i really need you to know ...
when you went , i should have ...
and our family .

no , no , no . i can 't let you go through there on your own .
hey , babe .
can i get a hello first ? can i get some love ?
that sounds like fun .
but i never met a stranger .

and if we 're being honest , let 's keep being honest .
it 's 30 days behind .
my house has been paid for for over four years .
what are you talking about ?
did you find a body ?
so you assumed that this was blood loss .
well , can your dna test determine when that blood was left there ?
so it 's a possibility that the blood
you know what you just did ?
that 's what you did .
i don 't get it .
baby , come on , just eat a little bit .
i don 't want it ! who are you , my father ? i don 't want it !
okay ?
why didn 't you say something ?
there is no way i can honour that request .
in case of a family emergency , you can grant an inmate supervised leave .
what do you think this is , a siesta ?
those two words mean anything in your country ?
i 'm not gonna warn you again .
i can 't stay , nick.i 'll get back .

no . not freddy . you know this .
you 're forgetting one thing .
jerry , kill me . i wanna die .
don 't worry ,
no ! don 't ! i gotta do it . i gotta do it .
the fourth angel is lucifer .
lucifer is an angel that , uh ... . a fallen angel .
you see what i mean ?
what about the body ?
yours , jerry .
bloody blooming right it 's jolly well high time .
i super-hate those pills .
she 's not a bad person .
just say " no . " i do .
yeah
the divorce was final in september or something .
what kind of cat ?
like a black and white
no , the real question is are cats good with me ?
oh , my god , yeah .
you 've got that right .
yeah , yeah . me , too ! me , too . me , too .
he was not having it . he tore up my couch .
they already know . i told them .

nobody can prevent grandchamp from launching that missile .
not even the president .

it 's that or apocalypse .
it 's a turning-point in history . we have all trained
distance from magic point 2 ?
captain takes the boat .
captain , someone 's messing with us .
no , we continue the sequence .
with that logic in syria , we 'd be dead .
take care of titan .
i 'm already giving you the friends and family discount .
we 're getting the friends and family discount .
slow down .
what are you doing ?
you see betrayal in others , but not yourself .
oh , of course you would have to believe that .
" excuse me , stormtrooper . "
so , what 's gonna happen next ?
i don 't know .
then she 's going to have to convince your mother to let you go into space .
i had no choice .
he can 't go to space .
do you know he once got an asthma attack
no , i was there that day .
i don 't know what i 'm going to do .
am i the bad guy in this ?
we 're just here to provide comfort and support
i took our love and threw it under his bus-sized mother .
well , that-that 's good . i 'm glad you came to that .
what ?
can we talk ?
all right .
i was gonna tell her eventually ,
i got scared .
i know .

my company designs the menus for the cheesecake factory .
well , my dad . but me and my sister are vps .
i know it sounds easy , but there 's a lot of science that goes into designing them .
it 's a time of day i invented .
i 'm fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need .
i would snort in derision and throw my arms in the air ,
but we-we put all your vital information into this dating site ,
even assuming you could answer any question the way i would ,
capable of devastating a major city .
they were identified as low level chechen separatist .
by enabling acts of terror
normally , you and your team would be tasked
and now we know who you are .
pursue us , you 'll be caught . resist us , you 'll be killed .
good luck , mr. hunt .
mr. chairman , the tmf 's

he 'll die , before you turn him .
you should go , before it gets ugly .
you should go .

alpha team prep . standing by .
langley brimstone , go .
langley , there 's nobody here .
another one vanishes here is flight 606 ?
is it that time already . okay .
i know and i 'm gonna answer truthfully .
i 'm actually third in line to the throne .
why would he contact me ?
tell me what you make of them .
look at the photographs , dunn .
all of them were government agents .
these are highly classified

that thought had cross my mind .
you seem to thinks i have some kind of obligation to him .
ethan hunt is still out there in the field , and i 'm stuck here answering for it
that 'll be all , dunn .
ethan , where are you ? where the hell have you been ?
everything is going to be fine . just keep walking
for your sake , we shouldn 't be seen together .
but isn 't this taking the role a little too far .
oh . we haven 't formerly introduced .
tlsa faust . you 're ethan runt .
new identity , passport , cash , road map .
everything you need to make it to dc undetected
it 'll go easier if you tell them what they want to hear .
him .
missing , presumed dead
former mossad .
tonight , i made it official .
the same day a car accident killed the visiting fpresident of malawi .
hours before a passenger plane vanished over the pacific
right before a fired petrochemical plant gassed a village of 2,000 people .
that missing plane was carrying the secretary of the world bank .
i can 't protect you .
it 's not your decision to make , ethan .
all i know about you is that you chose to work for hunley .
you don 't have to worry about ethan .
this is the cia , this is hunley we 're talking about .
they 're going to kill ethan . they 're going to kill benji .
you need to understand something .
i believe you
not much .
his name is solomon lane . he created the syndicate .
he 's former british intelligence .
syndicate was created by one of their own .
so that the other one can access the computer without being caught .
can i get in through there
in the pipeline . and before you ask .
no oxygen tanks .
well . then , you just have to hold your breath for 2 minutes .
so , i have to hold my breath for 3 minutes ?
the more you exert yourself , the faster you consume oxygen .
all he has to do is install the fake profile before i get to the gait analysis .
that doesn 't sound impossible .
so , how are we suppose to find ethan and benji before they do ?
so where are we going ?
the syndicate 's entire infrastructure .
it 's everything you want to know .
why would lane want it so badly if it wasn 't authentic ?
did you never stop to consider he may want me to have it ?
even after you gave him the disk ?
that 's a le
they don 't care if you live or die .
i hope you would .
i 'm listening .

agency which is since been dissolved .
but new intelligence suggest that he 's been
and if you don 't mind i asking ,
he came forward with first hand knowledge of the plot against you .
he believes it is the key to bring down the syndicate
and it was , prime minister . i can assure you .
i don 't understand . prime minister , your life is in danger .
sir . does the name , solomon lane , ring a bell ?
so , there actually is a syndicate ?
recruit former agents from other nations. supply them with a new identity
i rejected the proposal unequivocally .
prime minister , there is no any syndicate .
there is no secret he cannot extract no security he cannot breach .
he has mostly likely anticipated this very conversation
prime minister .
sir , please step away from the prime minister .
attlee shot me
desperate times , desperate measures , sir .
do you know who i am ?
but lane went rogue and turn it against you , didn 't he ?
that 's why you erased the disk which she brought it to you .

no one is arguing that , but you are asking us

i brought you pears yesterday ma remember from jimmy ?
ok , i will .
work was , uh , the same as every other day .
my pop taught me how to use this when i was little .
bit surprised , but it 's doing the trick .
i was always telling your pop he should sell this crap
yeah , except his family .
hmm .
oh . all right , i 'll leave you the news .
nah , i 've gotta wait for a customer .
how was your day , mane ' ?
it was the best day i 've had in a long time .
how was your day , ma ?

oh , man . i 'm sorry to hear that .
no , right ? figures .
do you have your ticket ?
just go back there and cet my shoes
i heard somebody 's not cooperating
you gotta know , you can 't hide looking the way you do .
there 's a fake wall behind the bathroom mirror .
it 's pretty ugly in there .
the body was right here .
he was dead i swear .
there was a blue bag here with my shoes in it
and my taser .
in fact there was a whole cache of guns ! what the hell ?
oh , yes i have and you know with who ? your father .
yeah .
what are you saying ?
you knew this all this time and you didn 't tell me ?
he made me promise not to .
he said that i was the only one he could trust .
new rules , jimmy !
max , i just don 't want you to make the same mistakes
you 're who ?
care to tell me what you 're doing here ?
oh , and she didn 't finish signing it .
pull her hair ! now 's your chance .
that check should have cleared .
even for a little boy , by imitation ,
and nobody believed , but he was like that .
we went to this place in wales to make a competition .
yes .
and sharing it with all my friends and with my father .
my father , he says , " listen .
and i say , " okay , if you say so , i will do that . "
so , how did you get your first part in an opera ?
and my debut was the 29th of april , 1961 ,
it 's love . it 's passion . it 's very beautiful . it 's casual .
and desperate , because there is. that is there .
i sang there in 1963 with great success .
if you want to become luciano pavarotti ,
you can have a beautiful , nice life of the tenor ,
everything .. everything was easy .
it was super clear , like a photograph .
a tenor singing a high c makes your ears vibrate .
we all dreamed to be the most important in the operatic world .
so i was the first boy after six years
everybody was looking for me .
i think luciano loved women . and he also trusted them .
suddenly , in between my relationship
that was certainly an important point
everything became more geared towards mass appeal .
yeah .
there 's so much repertoire .
one of us suggested , " why don 't you do this one and i do that ? "
so , to pick , you know , between the saddest and so and so .
you know what kind of determination , you know what kind of fears
it was okay , like , " anything you do , i can do better . "
" boy , what a phrase you did . now let me do this one . "
it 's kind of hard to overstate what an impact that had .
the three tenors transformed three guys
at the age of 60 , he shouldn 't do such things .
divorce at that time was unthinkable .
in italy , this story played out for years .
men have four or five wives .
so , at the beginning , i spent ,
and while mrs. pavarotti is in seclusion ,
but my wife suffered more .
he caught it-in the neck for-pavarotti the pop star .
and now-falling in love ... ... he-caught-it in the neck again .
ooh . guy must 've been a hunter .
did i hear you say that you thought that she looked like amber ?
like , just under six feet , blonde hair , kinda top-heavy .
yeah , and you think that shelly looks like her ?
yeah .
short with dark hair ,
uh , shelly .
we 're both seeing completely different versions of you .
the guy 's got white hair .
okay , i 'll tell you what ... if we can get you in touch with marconi
we got a direct line . here .
you dreamt you were being chased through the forest by your mother .
that 's right , arnie . everything you know is wrong
a lot worse .
we were just a year or two out of high school ,
i once knew a man
emergency room , john .
yeah . i don 't know what else to do . i 'm not gonna play this game with you .
he pulls out this sauce and goes ,
i mean that didn 't happen .
did anyone else take the sauce ?
i think they got freaked out when they saw a needle come out .
are you kidding me ? how could i not ?
okay , all right .
uh , hi . i need a priest .
what can i do for you ?
have any experience with , like .
no no no . no no . i 'm not crazy .
why don 't you come talk to me ?
well , they never know they 're ill , do they ?
i suppose you just feel regular
oh fuck !
yes , son , i am .
nothing you 're seeing is real .
look , i appreciate your time , but .
son , i 'm going to be honest with you .
tohn ! tohn !
who the fuck are you ?
congratulations . now who the fuck are you
it is said out of genuine concern for your safety .
korrok is a powerful adversary .
fascinating . what ?
do the bees know that they make the honey for you
do you ever wonder why sometimes you 'll see
black stuff. this soy sauce .
oh , i 'll get to that .
it lets you read minds and all that .
i don 't know . it 's like .... . when you 're on it , it 's like overload .
and you 've still got some of this stuff ?
you 're on it right now .
yeah , i took some today .
it is physically impossible to avoid it .
ah ! shit
wait a minute .
what the fuck is that thing ?
it 's pretty freaky though , right ?
you made me see something
no , it 's really there .
most people only see it that fast if they 're stoned or drunk .
i need to . i need to get it out .
the truth . okay .
okay .
anyway , so the cop comes in ,
he went into convulsions or something . his pulse stopped .
we 've got vinnie doing cpr on him .
now you listen to me , boy .
he can 't hurt me , right ?
dave , it 's me . where are you right now ?
the sauce .. iu was alive
listen ,
i had a full 1.78 seconds before the detective would step through the door .
to that machine , one second is an eternity .
meaning ?
high school kid ?
i remember now . he 's that kid .. kinda talks like a junior gangster .
well , he 's the guy. who called in the ..
i thought he was stabbed in the gut or something
yeah , i guess .
ghost door .. you see it ?
all i see is a wall
now the tripper may not kill korrok ,
well , i like the concept , doctor .
just decide that you want to and you will .
you see , by 1881
in 1926 mr. rooney passed away .
the very day mr. rooney passed , it became sentient
for some , this process was easy .
an entity so powerful
we are all very excited
that if franz kafka was here ,
gentlemen , you are about to see something
20 years ago korrok foretold your coming
but we have tried . oh , we have tried .
you can show us the way to go from our world to your own
mmm , bacon !
we have observed you and will soon move
you think there 's something in there , arnie ?
open it .
i 'm sorry , arnie . i really am .
look at your body , armie .
you 've been dead for days . i think someone got wind
i 'm not a fucking ghost .
i 'm thinking you got killed right after we talked on the phone .
well , when you got killed ,
i don 't accept it .
i got a vacation coming up in june .
still can 't sit down , huh ?
ah , take your coat off .
oh , pat , it took half a tit to get him off .
krissi , turn that fire off . we 're broke .
here you are , son , hand him over .

johanna , you get to make first contact
leaping lizards !
what ?
yes , sir .
i do have a proper question now .
why are your songs so sad ?
.. that 's big one .
.... you see , i was , uh ..
i can give you the headline .
you 're kind of crushing my
i know . i am so sorry . i have two things for you .
my brother 's fanzine .
the one they wouldn 't let me print .
the other piece ..
transfer your votes to martini .
it 's too late for that .
of course , yeah . you dance with someone ?
so , for the sake of the dignity of my office , yes , with someone .
please .
you 've been one of my harshest critics ,
no , not directly , but , um ...
my church ?
is moving in directions that i can no longer condone ,
i no longer wish to be a salesman .
it 's a metaphor .
a product ?
i cannot , in all conscience , endorse .
it seems to me that we are no longer part of this world .
we are not connected .
holy father ...
oh , well .
love has many faces .
i still have san lorenzo .
that priest , that day , me finding him there .
you have such certainty .
and i 'm certain ... he wants me to retire .
do you play the piano or any instrument ?
you , uh ... you made an album .
that 's right , i did .
the signal is not good here .
yes .
my favorite program is kommissar rex .
.. the trouble he gets into .
it 's very fun , oh my . it takes my mind off things .
here , in this place , they call me " god 's rottweiler , "
so i never say anything .
you know , it 's a small pleasure .
yeah .
let me help you .
i hope this urgent business is not too distressing .
oh , good luck with that .
yeah .
otherwise known as the " blond angel of death . "
how long will you stay quiet ?
no . if you spoke , you would be one more , like us .
making contacts .
with fear .
she warned me ,
i was his teacher . now he 's head of the jesuits in argentina .
these are the guys learning skills .
they 're real artists !

i didn 't know you could say that . that 's ... that 's useful .
as a child , i failed you first by not ..
instead , i hid away in books , and then study
oh , don 't know . you okay ?
well , i 've got a valve replacement .
altman just has to shut up and watch .

i think dad 's back from the shop .
mummy said she 'd put on a sari but she 's not changed .
this is an important time for me .

yeah , i do .
i hope we get to spend lots of time together .
bailey , you 're my mentor
okay , you have ...
we do it because when you say you want the truth ...
shepherd says his wife 's still unconscious , too .
so even if i cared , i wouldn 't trade .
i don 't know what that is .
what could either be pizza sauce or blood .
i was hoping it was blood , and you were dying
these interns are sloppy .
and i trained you ,
swag bags for the syrians .
dr. murphy is gonna run some labs
okay .
it doesn 't mean you 're gonna get it .
it 's entirely possible it means nothing at all .
i want you to call the lawyer .
even if you get the disease , it 's decades away .

sorry . i 'm here . i had to get a piece of gum .
well , she will love him whatever his name is .

i got a blade i can use for skin grafting .
oh , check with ross .
wait . i thought brooks was on your service today .
he likes to follow through .
her flight got canceled ,
but this is pretty standard , right ?
it 's an unusually aggressive infection ,
you don 't want to cut too deep .
that 's good . but no deeper .
okay , so you want to place the screws
mm-hmm . now advance the screw by hand . yeah .
don 't be afraid to push too hard .
not when you don 't have anesthesia .
let 's go at this another way .
it 's okay .
and meanwhile , you 're sitting here .
my mom 's not coming here
i had a low-grade fever .
so i came in .
okay .
i just can 't be a mom .
they already have a mom .
you 're not dying right now . you know that right ?
can you check out bed three ?
uh , no , not yet .
why didn 't you talk to me first ?
but you knew that i was concerned about this case .
it shouldn 't be news to you
shane , you have to stop .
yeah , but she annoys you , doesn 't she ?
brooks has an instinct for this that you don 't have .
well , if i 'm making up for it , who cares how ?
you should find a specialty where you shine .
doesn 't that count for anything ?
and that means , to me , i have to teach her , not you .
go figure out where .
where are we going , sensei ?
just use peripheral vascular instruments
and then thread both ends
yes , but not for long , please .
oh , he 'll be fine with social services .
this kid doesn 't have to .

all done .
unequal , brother , to your duties as a good citizen .
" whoops . i shot a fucking cop . sorry .

this place is a shit-hole , doc .
they revoked my license to practice three years ago ,
breaking down your immune system
no , i 'm saying , cocaine made you more susceptible .
i thought azt 's supposed to help me .
it kills every cell it comes in contact with .
as well as the mineral zinc to build your immune system .
sounds fun ?

bless your little heart .
i promise you , that i will try my very best .
okay .

i say what goes in my body , not you .
you think i 'm one of your goddamn guinea pigs , sevard ?
mr. woodroof
well , hear this .
why are my fucking walls painted red ?
people can live with this thing for longer than they 're saying
if you 're abusing it , like you did

she got full blown aids .
here i 'm gonna need your complete medical history .

who do you think is gonna do that when i 'm not here ?
god sure was dressing the wrong doll
look , it 's one thing for me not to like you
you don 't believe that i would actually ...
that snake you work for . that 's my prime candidate .
as a matter fact , if you hear of anything in his office
and , what is going on ?
non toxic drug , that i got proof it works .

the pain persisted , so he took another ...
unfortunately , when mike 's pain began to subside ,
but mike never shared this with those who cared about him ,
i 'm out . i need to meet you tomorrow .
it 's not like he 's trying to put a ring on my finger .
aw , he 's so beautiful when he sleeps .
he 's fine , but i 've been doing so reading ,
isn 't it designed to facilitate breast-feeding ? :
you 're not lactating .
well , that doesn 't make caring for an infant any less tiring .
i suppose .
she 's broke and old and rude .
stella is very resourceful .
okay , this is no time for name-calling .
well , don 't worry , ma 'am .
we 'll find out exactly what happened to your husband .
mom , want to mall with derek back later j
all right . how was it ?
i doubt if the crown i put in will last her a year .
that 's not the point .
if we did , he mightn 't have turned out so ...
lazy ?
i was going to say angry ,
of course , that 's off the menu these days .
and if you 're as tired as you say you are ,
you 're leaving our bed ?
i 'll have a better shot at both if i 'm alone .
i don 't think so .
you should have told the truth about us .
adam , let me in .
oh , my god .
oh , well , good . at least she 's not living like a hobo .
know it 's a little dicey , but you 'd really be doing me a big favor .
i haven 't seen her since i delivered danielle 's baby .
hey , andrew .
is this about the other morning ?
i am . in fact , i already gave the landlord a check .
yeah , he said that you owed him money for some ..
yeah .
he 's coming back tomorrow .
well , it 's about the mayor .
i think he 's dead .
carlos please .
now they know someone else was with him on the boat .
it 's just a matter of time .

oh , i think you 'll find this has a real kick .
i thought i told you to stay away from my house .
and , heyyou married into a cute family.kudos .
now get out .
i 'm taking julie on a tour of my campus .
you son of a bitch.you set me up .
now where do you think you 're going ?
i failed as a woman .
i don 't think that 's how it works .
so ashamed .
uh , sorry.i didn 't mean to eavesdrop , but , um ...
you know , he 's always talked like that .
i 'm sorry.you want this around ?
and for the next few years , she would be known as
a mysterious cassette tape had ben discovered by my friend bre .
oh , no , she 's not .
you better get over there . she 's wearing cotton .
what 's that ?
i held onto it in case of an emergency .
but if you want to give it a shot , be my guest .
oh , which one goes and which one stays ?
you want to talk about good neighbor etiquette ?
i am on a fixed income .
run by germans , hm ?
you 're going to the hospital , mrs. mccluskey .
i don 't wanna go alone . come with me .
and i 've got a roast in the ... freezer .
all that time i was looking for her .
i 'm so sorry .
i wanna tell you what my doctor said .
see , i had this skin tag ,
please , i can 't sleep in the den anymore .
you might wanna try a motel ,
obviously a few more .
i admit , i was way out of line .
you know what to do .
well , then have fun at the motel .
what ?
what am i supposed to do for money ?
i 'm unhappy . with carlos and my marriage ..
every time something went south in my life ,
oh , um ... now 's not a good time .
that 's great , because my car 's on the fritz
i know you 're trying to get over morty
you know how blue i 've been . why can 't you be supportive ?
you haven 't . you really haven 't .
if he 's not gone in five minutes ,
delfino .
your mother tells me
no . i 'm gonna need every drop .
aren 't they gorgeous ?
sorry .
shh ! talk later , you 're watching the game .
you have no money , what 's the story :
i also forgot i have options . a whole bunch of ' em .
i don 't need your credit cards . carlos .
but if our marriage is going to work ,
open these , would you , and put out the pills ?
god knows what your kids pick up .
she said she doesn 't think i 'm going to heaven .
i 'm sure she didn 't mean to hurt your feelings .
when she said that to me .
i 've been called worse .
you know what , kyle ?
it won 't be right away
look at you .
everybody who meets me wants to be my friend .
what kinda name is swin anyway ?
if we go 83 the rest of the way we won 't be late .
if you decide to run off ,
do not bring girls around
why , just think . one day this could all be yours .
vacuumin ' his corvette .
would either of you boys like to call me sir ?
we 're gonna go traffic drugs across state lines , sir !
how many of those you got anyway , like , ten ?
sounds like a stripper recipe to me .
one of ' em 's already named cinnamon .
that 's why you 're so good at this shit . your brain 's managing
in whose car ?
do i look like a drug dealer to ya ?
testament gave me a suit .
i miss him to much .
i am so sorry to hear that , but you know what ?
that shit you sold him was bunk .
it 's boring . you don 't wanna. you don 't even wanna ..
put it in the dryer with the rest .
probably already counted it as just lost .
uh , maybe only that something 's not right .
it 's impossible to tell right now and that 's the truth .
he won 't even tell me where his family lives .
okay .
how bad is it
i didn 't
like wholesale .
and park ranger bright , he was our boss .
we didn 't know what to do or who to tell , so
as soon as we found the bodies .
these trailers are pieces of shit .
we need to go shopping this weekend .
we need to get a stroller , crib , that kinda thing
you ain 't gonna say hi
hey , barry . is your daddy still dead ?
barry , i think it 'd be best if we made you
why would i bother myself tryin ' to figure all this out anyway , you know ?
every time i come over here ...
how about you ? you know where mr. bright is ?
look at me , look at me , look at me , look at me .
you 're okay . you 're okay . you 're okay .
you 're one of us now
go on . all right , ready ?
we 're full in our rights to use it .
and then some .
our aunt don 't really care what we do all day .
how do you like being mechanics ?
well , it happens , i 'm in the black market game .
so what do you say ?
what 's the title ?
senior distribution executive
you may never refuse an order and you may never quit .
i will hunt ya down and i 'll kill ya , no matter how much i 've grown to like ya .
tim , you 'll no longer wear that earring .
well , gang bangers are taking more streets day by day .
but what do you think , frog ?
it 's your business now . you do what you want with it .
maybe you took too many hits to the head .
i don 't want it to be like that with us .
you boys are ready .
i 'll open up a little curio shop .
we wanna have as much good debt as possible
i intend to kill you by strangulation .
why not just shoot me ?
what , do you roll the ball around in a circle 500 times
it was gonna be a star and a moon ,
excuse me .
my feet are like sausages .
but you are going to get a crash course education
the only thing that matters is the evidence .
what is he talking about ?
and the evidence in this case will focus on
we will establish that dr. torres made a series
implant 's in place . everything looks good .
all right , let 's start closing . irrigation , please .
we 're missing one sponge .
we can 't close until we find it .
all right , you know , it 's gotta be on someone 's shoe
no , that 'll take too long . he could go into shock .
oh , crap , crap , crap , crap , crap , crap .
no , there 's no time .
you can 't do that !
we still haven 't
i had to force him to come in .
i 've seen worse .
yeah .
a small one . travis ,
oh , wow ? what does " oh , wow " mean ?
the wound looks a little infected .
yeah . okay .
we can 't afford any delays .
all right , if she 's not available in the next five minutes ,
no , there 's no way to salvage the joint .
and just .. leave him with no hip ?
it 's the only way to get this completely cleaned out .
oh , yeah . it 's the best .
and the peeing .
oh , and then the .. the no booze .
it 's never nothing .
my lawyer 's on speed dial , for crying out loud .
you really didn 't have to come all this way .
my baby 's in trouble .
oh , all right . well , i don 't understand .
we split up . she cheated on me . it 's been bad .
when did this happen ?
why didn 't you tell me ?
i-i fought so hard just to get you to accept us .
cristina
will you tell callie to back off and let me do my job ?
he can 't live without a functioning heart .
he 'll be more stable , and the heart surgery will be less risky .
let me try to save his leg .
oh , he was febrile overnight but his white count 's stable .
travis ?
what 's wrong ?
are we losing this case ?
we haven 't presented our side .
richard ! well , you shouldn 't be here .
it 's a miracle i made it here at all .
i even spoke with the team who invented it .
and the surgery ? it went smoothly ?
what wasn 't perfect ?
and that 's when you left the sponge .
and i would do it again .
i-i believe that the sponge wouldn 't compromise the joint .
it was the right call .
not a mistake .
you wanted to work on travis 's leg .
why ?
which is an indication that the limb is starting to die .
once a limb turns black , there 's nothing we can do .
and she knew that the heart would keep throwing out clots
okay , let 's say you 're cooking ,
what do you do ?
or do you extinguish the curtains ?
i cannot believe you 're picking this fight right now !
i am trying to tell you how i feel .
okay ? it wasn 't just your kid .
wanna do it ? i bet they 'll let us temp together .
oh , god . last week ,
he won 't do it . i 've asked him like seven times .
oh , yeah , i worked here before .
it came from here .
i went ahead and printed out my address ,
oh , crap ! i spilled champagne on my good bucket blazer .
i 'm doing doug from the sexual harassment video .
especially that sad h.r. scene
now it 's my booze bib .
somehow it 's small enough to fit in your purse ,
i talked to eli about hiring you full-time .
i will knock you to the ground !
it comes with health care .
are you trying to take away a woman 's right to choose ?
yup , that 's her .
me harassing you ?
caroline , this isn 't a joke .
wait , what 's going on ?
it is nice to hear you humming again .
yeah .
next month , so i have some time before i start feeling like total crap again .
are you sure ?
orson , i said be careful !
welli don 't see the problem with it ..
yeah , and showers aren 't just about presents.they 're fun .
well yeah.i don 't bake.catch up .
why don 't you just let it go ?
nonsense .
and your baby .
you know , it 's often a sign of twins
i , uh , bet you wouldn 't mind if i broke my neck on that scooter now .
aunt lily just took a pill , so she 's down for the afternoon .
this is what i wanted .
i pretended to so she 'd leave us alone .
then why did he always avoid you ?
because of you !
again , karen , we are so sorry .
you can let me go , all right ? i 'm okay .
i didn 't break in . i ...
went in the wrong house .
i just ... i just had a little too much fun last night .
thanks to me , you have a genetic predisposition to alcoholism .
i can be pretty resourceful .
hey . i saw the party rental truck . what 's going on ?
wh ... our spring fling ? we 're .. still flinging ?
oh , i don 't know . unless the theme is
well , we can 't ignore the fact
they told me there was no chance ...
beth is alive , and i intend to keep her that way
beth was not in her right mind when she signed those forms .
and who 's the client ?
coffee ? doughnuts ?
this is an a.a. meeting .
lying to your son .. which step is that ?
my chief financial officer took a job in london ,
glenn , where 'd this come from ?
so i started asking around . come to find out everybody loves you .
i 'm prepared to give you a very generous salary ,
but no .
what ?
look , tom , i don 't want to buy a man out of his loyalty ...
lynette ... glennyou have made my day , but i gotta pass .
i 'm not gonna screw over carlos .
nothing .
lynette , as much as i appreciate you trying to run my life ,
anyone else want to share ?
when i hear you guys talk
you know , i ... i think her greatest regret in life
i mean ...
nothing i ever did was good enough for her .
you 're not exactly a born leader . "
well , maybe she was busy
uh , bree ?
well , there is a difference between sharing and whining .
god ...
so i just want to remind you about the panty renee and i are throwing tomorrow night .
so .. renee and i are still having our party ...
beth young .
making me the compassionate one .
yeah , he was exhausted .
and now she 's gone .
maybe she can recover .
i 'm not praying for her .
we did this to her , paul .
and we have to let her rest .
sure .
look , the deal was one meeting , mom . i went and i 'm done .
nope . elvis has left the building .
i hope you know that " i don 't have a problem "
i ... i have no job .
doing a little better here .
you are a valuable part of this company .
oh , that 's great .
and you are walking away from real money and real power
told ya . well , i 'm pretty close to capacity ,
wait . is that the guy from animal control
uh , these are mostly people i 've met through the years
is it okay if i clean your pool
ugh ! don 't give me that look .
honey , the only mix i see
you have a cool house .
well , i 'm not sad , and i 'm not gonna pretend to be .
and whose fault is that ?
i can 't tell if we are gonna drive ...
what time does this have to be back ?
i 'm guessing we could be a little late .
hello , susan .
as you know , our decision to forgo direct ascent
well , even considering von braun 's initial criticism ,
dave scott is gonna be your pilot .
don 't worry about elliot .
oams propellant , 13 % .
gemini 8 , coming back into range in three , two , one .
how do you read ?
we have serious problems .
we 're disengaged from the agena .
what seems to be the problem ?
yeah .
we did everything , as far as i know .
we saw flawless rendezvous and docking .
how near were you to being unconscious ?
we did .
as i said , we initially assumed
i 'm done .
jimmy asked what you 're gonna say
uh ... a lot of things have to go right
um .... well , we launch in ten days ,
we 'll be in isolation .
and i know how much you love single malt scotch .
oh , god , no , i bought it for you .
i 'm trying to finish this book i started a long time ago .
about heidegger and fascism .
another book about heidegger and fascism .
'm blocked . i can 't write
i can 't write ' cause i can 't breathe .
i , you know .. the will to breathe .
inspiration , you know ?
i 'm sorry about this afternoon .
and you took the cialis ?
can i confess something ?
i deliver them to him , they don 't want to go .
he sticks ' em in a corner of the garage he works at .
i mean , they should be outside , in the fresh air .
on what grounds ? :
switching custody would be a disaster .
i brought in the kids ' teachers , i brought in the kids ' doctors .
and you 're sure he can 't be recused ?
it 'm due in court in six weeks .
i can 't get a decent night 's sleep .
i mean , i actually thought of taking them out of the country .
you 'd be a fugitive .
he won 't get cancer .
if you want him dead , you have to make it happen .
on the other hand , i could kill him for you , lady ,
i could perform this blessing for that poor woman
what , you 're shaking
an anxiety attack or something .
okay .
everything about killing judge spangler turned me on .
i was intrigued by the creative challenge of bringing off a perfect murder .
no one can stop him .
it 's not that ambiguous , even though it 's ugly to say it .
the dizziness and anxiety had disappeared ,
my mind was racing with ideas , plans to kill judge spangler .
i knew you 'd love that lighthouse .
oh , it 's so beautiful here .
not to have to rely on single malt scotch .
what you are is in love with the romantic concept
is that really what you think ?
and even your poet laureate .
my god , what have you been eating for breakfast ?
what happened to the philosophy professor ?
for the first time in so long , i felt free .
run away with me .
my zest for life had returned
one day a week , he played bridge with his cronies at the pavilion club .
saturday mornings , he jogged at lippitt park .
why continental philosophy ?
where 's roy tonight ?
and now that we 're here , i 'm determined to win you a prize .
his spirits seemed up ,
i want to go with my first instinct . there 's my first hunch , 17 .
no , it 's a bad idea . it 's a bad idea .
you have a terrific boyfriend
come on , let 's have fun .
but maybe it was just that he wasn 't in love with me
all i was sure of was that as much as i cared for roy ,
i was right in thinking the killing would be an act of creativity .
weighing all the options , i came to the conclusion
cyanide would be quick and painless .
every stage of the way was a risk and i must admit , exhilarating
yeah .
well , that 's cool .
yes , i know .
sure , sure , but can we talk as we walk ?
i don 't understand . you 've been in such a touchy mood .
yeah , but the only reason i got the tickets
roy and i aren 't exclusive , i told you that .
roy would say different .
well , god , i 'm sure , but we were celebrating .
well , who do you think it was ? do you think it was the woman ?
or , one of her friends or something ?
i feel like an authentic human being .
that life has the meaning you choose to give it .
it was as if whatever had been stifling his deepest feelings became unblocked .
at a press conference ,
you 're wearing a new perfume .
what ?
today for one very funny moment ,
don 't know , i con 't know .
it 's got to be hard to kill somebody .
especially to poison a stranger .
i mean , cyanide 's a whole other deal .
i always assume anyone poisoned , is poisoned by cyanide .
i mean , someone would have to be close enough to him
i enjoyed the whole conversation .
oh , that 's a good point .
someone appears out of the blue , and drops something in his drink ?
or someone could have gone to pascal 's and gotten a juice ,
right .
and he was right . i wasn 't . but i didn 't know what to do anymore .
oh , yes , are you gonna tell me that she had an affair with him ?
no , she has this hilarious theory about abe lucas .
she thinks he would be a good suspect in that case of the murdered judge .
oh , please .
once i was inside abe 's house , i felt i was betraying him .
i couldn 't imagine what i expected to find .
oh , are you kidding ?
not flabbergasted .
i played out my last few weeks at braylin
i knew jill would never betray me .
well , there goes my theory . i guess i ' never work for the tbi
i don 't know
look , it 's none of my business ,
and it 's not like he 's some great cyclist or something .
how much is it worth ?
and that ticket is as good as cash .
maybe i take a little finder 's fee , let 's just say a third .
what ? ls mr lin in charge ?
let me tell ya something , boys . i am a cop !
hey . come on , it wasn 't that bad .
get your buddy to bellevue .
that 's how long it took you to soak yourself in gasoline and set it on fire .
i think i 'm gonna need the address .
two hours in the chair . can you believe it ?
i 'm gonna go get my morphine . i 'll be right back .
i 'll take care of myself .
what 's going on ?
nima .
you know what ? it 's really uncool to let a messenger service
it 's hard enough out there .
i gave it back to the front desk .
who told them to change the address ?
you get your envelope back ?
but it 's going to the wrong place .
what do you care ?
it 's like a receipt for a great deal of money .
a man or a woman ? that would be a dude .
i gave it to manny .
hey , jersey , you wanna move your fat-ass suv !
l / vilee .
wait !
shit .
you get to 28th street before i do , i 'll give you the envelope .
i don 't have time for this bullshit , man .
and that steel pig you 're riding ain 't gonna help you neither .
i 'll give you the 50 bucks !
come on , man , you don 't wanna drag your hefty ass up this hill .
the kind with a masters in bullshit and obfuscation .
aren 't you afraid of dying ? i mean , the way you ride .
that is collective insanity .
sounds good .

i 'll get this guerrero up to speed .
no , no . nothing should ever come before your terrorism cases . ever .

you 're protecting someone , siefert ,

i can 't have you questioning him at the moment .
do me a favor , okay ? let me run point on this .
suit yourself .
i thought you didn 't want it .
bumpy , give me the ...
well , looks like you won another convert .
said he knows him as beckwith .
" horses might be the only thing he likes
he skipped parole , didn 't he ? your beckwith .
why ?
oh , yeah ? why is that ?
ghazala .
of course he did .

what is it , high school ?
we 're looking for an intellect .
he 's buried out in the yard .

before you say another word , you need to get yourself a lawyer .
i 'll be fine with whatever you decide to do about it , okay ?
but when they torched that van ..
he just ..

i found a real writer .
it 's your , uh , first time in seattle , huh ?
yeah . you 're just gonna , uh , you wanna go west on union

you could not have made the offer of your hand
you 've said quite enough , madam .
" as to your other accusation , of having injured mr. wickham ,
" wickham squandered it .
" thereafter he severed all ties with me .

none of these treatments will allow the baby to survive .

and this is what 's gonna happen , ok ?
and when i do spend time with you , i 'll be thinking about drumming
and you 're gonna tell me to ease up drumming , spend more time with you .

i 'm going to notify the authorities right now .
but i can 't let you do that .
if it 's the only way i can convince you , so be it .

so i think , at this point , chairman , you know ,
i 'm gonna have to kill a senator .
he ...
he didn 't tell us he was gonna do that .
they 'll never be allowed in the plant again .
all of our workers are members of the workers union .

don 't you give a shit about anyone but yourself ?
dude , i do care about the holden .
i was desperate .
you are not powerless , brodie .
well , how long did it take ? what ten , fifteen minutes ?
okay . well , you look adorable . it really brings out your eyes .
okay . i get my guitar .
but she ripped up the pages .
i have to try .
right .
me too .
do you always travel by driver ?
my father adopted him from an orphanage in hungary .
that 's you new home , dasha .
when i was a boy , this place was full of life .
it 's the only other access to the second floor .
she 's old and has a mind of her own .
it 's just a mannequin .
she liked to keep it .
what is this room ?
your son ?
i didn 't mention it , because i wasn 't ready to talk about it .
i 'd like to make toast
but i assured him
like tyler .
we were there for you then ,
to new beginnings .
nina , is there something you wanted to ask me ?
my phone is not working .
didn 't you call her yesterday ?
and the day before .
the message says its .... disconnected .
don 't you do anything for fun ?
my mama 's having dinner with karl ,
you 're good at this .
were you friends with him ?
i girl would go crazy around here with no friends .
wow !
i like vampire movies ,
well , you 've really outdone yourself , haven 't you , nina ?
oh , well , if it 's dasha 's favorite ,
you summon the courage , and you pull the fucking trigger .
please , karl , just give her to me .
afterward , he pulled me aside . he said , " karl ..
" nothing . "
that 's why i 've decided to spare you .
a chance that lucia and my mother never had .
good .
dasha ?
she 's just sleeping .
why is she ..
to make a difference for you ...
i offered to pay the board millions ,
you never know what you 're getting .
a young , healthy donor .
he 's my flesh and blood .
clean-built and trig-lookin ' !
we were on the breaks ...
and why , ask ye ? why ?
i ... i didn 't ..
the day was long as hell on that drive .
i stood and he slipped .
" tom , you dog ! "
and all i could think when he was done was ,
send for the lighthouse establishment ?
i 'll report ye , i 'll bring the inspector up ..
see ?
i 'm free from your designs !
up there !
last night you made a confession
but come a fortnight ,
his jaw locked tighter than an anchor bend ...
what were it ye accused me of ?
just let me into the light , old man .
just let me show you . another chance .
just let me into that lantern , is all .
or i 'll beg .
please !
stand down .
keepin ' it all to yourself .
look at ye , handsome lad ,
why ?
that 's ridiculous .
dude , my accent is brilliant .
this is what you sound like .
sheldon , do i really sound like that ?
why hasn 't stephen hawking played a word ?
maybe you weren 't challenging enough for him .
i was humiliating the man
you can 't beat hawking like that .
everyone knows the guy 's a big baby .
really ?
i told him he was wrong , but he kept insisting .
well , the next day , he had a pizza party ,
terrible .
coop and rolling thunder are together again .
so , now all you have to do is let him win .
i will play the word " at "
losing on purpose is intellectually dishonest .
oh , but i want to be hawking 's friend .
now , i have over 14,000 hours
observing , as opposed to ... ?
i worked with volunteers in actual simulations .
can you explain what that means ,
our plan involves , uh , using individual assessments
what kind of assessment ?
we understand this is a different approach ,
come on . what science ?
you 're getting emotionally involved .
w-we don 't know he was a terrorist .
i understand .
senate staff doesn 't have to run for reelection ,
but things seem to me even worse than i feared .
schnabel , gerd , captain .
look , i know things don 't go according to plan around here .
just tell me what the damage is .
please . for the refund .
money ?
heil hitler ! heil hitler !
is there any food left ? breakfast was a long time ago .
out !
as captain of the luftwaffe , i resent this disrespectful treatment .
you don 't want to show off your pay book to a corporal with that behavior ?
a special operation . special operation ?
with what warrant ? with what warrant ?
the top .
he 's heard a lot of things .
but first , tell me who you are .
at least in yours there has be something written .
then if i may ask for your papers , too ?
l shall also have to note that in my report , captain sichner .
yes , you know ..
you will have to show the pay book more often .
captain , i will accompany you on your inspection ,
my god , poland 1940 ..
i never forget a face .
up , ud , up , up , up !
i 'll buy you a drink .
that 's an outrageous luxury .
captain herold .
a pleasure . we take care of your men .
he is in charge of the guard unit . this is captain herold .
we 're forever waiting for the stand court . he 's not from the stand court .
all i heard was special ops , and i thought it was time to get serious .
to the fuhrer . himself .
yes . thats why i told captain herold about our storage problem .
yes , you know .. with all the escaped prisoners
we 're struggling with the same problems .
well , how do we know each other , oh so .
i just can 't remember .
what did i tell you , get out !
what 's the matter with you , huh ?
my father always said , " what you start , you finish . "
all right .
heil hitler ! take a look at this .
captain .
90 , dr. thiel .
uh , oh , that .
among the prisoners are some artists .
i 'll send you to the pit !
i 'm sick of this ! uh , yes . yes , i agree .
yes . but i 'm relatively better off .
so . oh .... . i 'm so hungry .
i 've got a pretty good instinct for that .
what do you think , gerda , huh ?
hm .. maybe a murderer ?
i am not a murderer at all . what are you then ?
sadly , yes .
it 's for one of her colleagues who is of asian descent ,
what can i say ?
amy .
i 'm not allowed to wear my silver surfer neck tie ,
you 're sick ?
well , see ya .
me ? no .
but our relationship agreement clearly states
no , the intent behind that clause
never mind . good night , sheldon .
i made a commitment in writing
i don 't need your medicine . i 'm not sick .
i got better two days ago .
so you 've just been lying to him ?
rubber cement .
don 't look at that , either .
i have some bad news .
i 'm working on a grant proposal for a new fusion reactor .
so they asked you to pack up your things and ship out .
you 're one of the good ones .
that 's ridiculous .
kind of a strange place
and nobody to know i forgot to turn off the laser .
our action figures have arrived .
$ 1,000 on action figures ?
yes , cocoa .
oh , teacher ! me ! me !
i am angrier than ever and filled with despair .
oh .. no , no , no , i know this .
yes , hot apple cider with cinnamon sticks !
and yet , now you 're in my office .
welcome to the thunderdome , kripke
why don 't you show me yours first .
we exchange at the same time .
how do i know you 're not going to do that with mine ?
sheldon , what 's going on ?
it 's leaps and bounds ahead of mine .
it 's his mommy .
what did you do , put this in your tea ?
now i 'm not even smarter than you .
you just got stuck on a wrong path .
he got stuck on the unified field theory for decades .
his great breakthroughs happened when no one knew anything .
sheldon lee cooper ,
all right , geez .
all the laid i 'm getting
she enjoys my genitals .
okay , stop bragging .
i 'll do what i can .
is it boy howdy , is it magic .
are you out of your mind ?
for as many dolls as we want .
at any point , did it dawn on you to talk to me
i don 't believe you !
what are you talking about ?
you make peanuts !
that means , when you get sick ,
you 're gonna return the machine .
oh , my god ! are you actually thinking about it ?
why didn 't you just tell kripke the truth ?
anyway , if kripke asks ,
why ?
he can protect me like my friends .
he protects me from the creatures that crawl in the night .
and the storm swept me up to a real high point ,
yeah , wow .

very well .

hollis said you found her .
i don 't have an exclusive deal here .
so if you arranged a deal
someone who knows enough law to know she 's right .
i have a contract , and i 'll sue you .
where does bull hancock eat lunch ?
but it 's gentlemen only .
i 'm sorry , mr. hancock .
it 's all right , brenda . it 's all right .
well , how 's it going ?
do tell .
the farm 's in bad shape , as is daddy .
well , horse farm needs a strong hand on the reins ,
i need a good trainer just to get things stabilized .
what do you mean , " trying " ?
excuse me . i 'm penny chenery , chris chenery 's daughter .
yeah , bull called me , but i tell you ,
well , i 'm in a bit of a tight spot .
we have plenty of good horses .
well , that 's why i 've come to see you , mr. laurin .
you 're going to have to go back to bull and see if he has any other ideas .
fore ! hey !
watch where you 're hitting !
penny ? penny ! do you know what that means ?
what is this ? come on . we need you here , penny .
right after the coin toss .
hollis . what are you doing here ?
how do you expect we can fetch a good price on the farm
this coin toss is big . the foal could be worth a great deal .
they think he wants hasty matilda 's foal .
no , hollis , i think that 's wrong .
world . you know more than they do ?
please don 't take offense , miss chenery ,
all right . we 're all here now .
the winner has the choice of the offspring of mr. chenery 's mares .
are we all in agreement here ? all right . here we go .
but i got what i wanted .
can i give you a lift home ?
phipps . he went with hasty matilda .
call me when she 's ready to drop her foal .
we 've been putting on this protest pageant for a year .
what do you mean you can 't ?
when the teacher saw what we were doing .. dad , can we , like , sue them ?
what ?
she scares me .
secretariat leaning against the back ofthe gate .
it wasn 't exactly what i had in mind .
he was ready to race . he just wasn 't ready to play bumper cars .
so do i. what were you doing ?
go on home . just go on .
excuse me ? what are you saying ?
are you sure that it was paul 's fault , then ?
no . it was my fault .
well , i know this .
you want a jockey who won 't back off , then you want ronnie turcotte .
know a lot more about it than i do .
every bit of this is my business ! do you understand ?
i called to check on your flight .
you 'd be able to ride in our next race .
i spoke with some of the owners you ride for .
you 're great with young horses .
use bad judgment . put a horse into too much traffic where he can 't run .
i hear you have the heart of a champion . i know my horse does .
i 'm sorry ?
what did lucien say ?
i want to win , just like they do .
but it 's who they are . and it 's who i am .
i don 't want somebody else .
his name is secretariat .
you don 't know which horses we own .
big red one .
yup .
close them up !
conditions are perfect . the track is rated very fast .
the field is spreading out . russ miron out quickly .
he 's got nowhere to move . i thought you said turcotte was aggressive .
secretariat . secretariat making a bold move .
i 'm not selling him .
but if he were to lose just one of the triple crown races
him and ogden phipps knew all that
and he 's got a horse named missed opportunity .
and they 're going to insist on a performance clause .
that 's a mile-and-a-half distance
this is a big deal . i have never done anything like this before .
you mind if i ask why you called me ?
your father , he really helped me and ...
i 'm in .
ladies and gentlemen , start your engines !
no , sir , he 's not for sale .
it 's a select opportunity . we have 32 shares ...
i will head that way . i 'll see you in a bit . all right , bye-bye .
nobody has .
we will call him back later . thank you .
no disrespect , sir , but if he gets any better ,
you could have her give me a call me later this afternoon .
orson ! not on the duvet ! oh , it 's okay .
mistress ' teeth in it ! let 's just take them to the police .
we can 't prove these came from alma 's .
and don 't forget , i 'm the one they suspect .
i agree , but not until we put the back in her house .
that 's how he could tell when people were lying through them .
in the moment it takes a gunman 's bullet to enter his victim 's leg ..
in the instant it takes a father to meet his son for the very first time ..
yes , and she hasn 't responded to any of the meds that we 've tried .
uh , not just yet .
it worked for her before .
this is your new lawyer , alan marcus .
hey , mike .
i was wrapping up an armed robbery trial .
so should we get started ?
i 've got a strategy to ensure your case never goes to trial .
what 's the strategy ?
he 'd only be pleading to manslaughter .
well which is better than life , and that 's what mike 's risking if he goes to trial .
with a better lawyer , he could be out in zero .
well , the evidence against him is very compelling .
my " feelings for him " ?
jeez .
a little bit of both .
your father 's taught you well .
what 'd you do with monique 's teeth ?
maybe i hid them here .
oh , l don 't think you 'll bring the police into this .
we 're done .
you shouldn 't treat me this way .
tears might 've worked when we were married , after you lost the baby .
we should have kept trying .
oh ! crap , that 's ed .
lynette , please ?
my boss is waiting for me outside in his car .
it 's time to get creative .
anything we can do ?
dirty ! see ya next week ! thanks for understanding !

i know ! you 're such a good dancer !
i 've been taking lessons ' cause i knew it was your favorite .
" cosmo , " ' 98 .
you researched me ? that 's sweet !
but gossip was the foundation of our relationship , so ..
ian was traveling a lot on business ,
so i guess they worked it out , right ?
but if you 're asking , did he ever really trust her again ? i don 't think so .
you play that pretty well .
i had a good time tonight , but ..
yeah , me too .
forget about it .
it 's not just them . i ...
you think just ' cause we 're two girls
you do that ? do you have a card ?
you ? she changed the menu again .
so what are we gonna do now ?
max , we can 't go .
we also need a shower curtain that doesn 't give us rashes .
we also really need a toilet
and we owe uncle sam $ 1,500 .
so what are we gonna do ?
well , it could have been alot worse
nicky. can you hear me ?
it 's temporary . so is the nausea .
i think i popped a couple stitches .

i can 't hear you .
not so fast .
you know that was my best suit .
investigators are combing through the debris ,
bomb was designed to maximize chaos .... injuries .

i haven 't seen one of these since iraq .
not usually .
which means , there 's possibly three detonators .
gcms identified residue
you can buy it at any gun store .
low explosive . why ?
the van bomb 's a different story .
that sounds like nate haskell .
yeah , he gets off on the intimacy
are you saying it wasn 't nate haskell ?
then who the hell is it ?
it 's crime driving without a license .
he 's a decent man .
and now the government took him away from us .
because ralph dared to live as a new american .
oh , a cell phone from their center detonated the bomb ,
well , i don 't know ... csi 's working on it .
could be a younger brother .
well , the owner of hank 's hobby shop
he 's not gonna talk to you .
we know how well that turned out , right ?
in case you haven 't noticed , it 's already blown .
what are you gonna do , nick ,
i mean , i owe him that much , don 't you think ?

and if she can do that , she can do anything .
robbins has her baby shower , so i 'm free .
dude

hey , it 's not like i went out for a cheeseburger .
look , i still don 't have approval from the fda , bailey .

grey ?
i 've been boning up .
oh , bite me , mark .
are you guys fighting again ?
oh , yeah . of course . it 's not a real shower
no , you can 't . because if you quit and move here ,
please stop calling . good-bye .
damn it . he 's got a mass . it 's close to his heart .
you ?
let alone allow you to operate on him .
it 's an extremely delicate surgery .
it 's win-win .
she 's a traditional girl , catholic .
that 's why i figured , the bigger shower , the better .
excuse me ?
every woman who 's ever had a pregnant friend hates them .
the bridesmaids always want to strangle the bride .
the only one who 's not normal here is you for acting like
uh , i 'm fine . i 'm fine over here . thanks .
come on . it 'll be fun .
i 'm going .
mr. green , there 's no time to wait .
yeah , of course . you do whatever you need to do .
and then what ?
look , i just did a surgery that i wasn 't approved to do .
the patient would 've died .
you have alzheimer 's , honey .
please take the test , baby .
fine .
thank you .
that way ...
we 're going to grow old together
oh , someone threw out the gift list ,
what 's going on ?
yes , mark . i lost the list .

besides me , who 's in charge here ?
this is nick stokes .
you 're sam 's little girl , right ?
just like your old man .
you should discuss this someplace else .
mr. boozell ,
i wouldn 't even let the sheriff past that tape ,
sam 's little girl .
the " booze " ?
let me guess .
yeah , so , uh , what now ?
i like murder better .
nick , help me out here .
i 'm not the one that got you in this mess .
a young woman was killed .
to a shark ?
she 's going to bleed out into the pool , period .
which could only mean she was dead
what happens ?
why ? because the artery 's like a pipe :
our victim did not die of a shark attack .
not on the front .
all ready .
oh , injection mark .
it would be impossible to inject yourself
catherine said coral .
according to shark week
that means the shark is only guilty of biting a dead woman .
dr. ray , it 's good to have you back .
i can 't help that she comes to me
seriously , you 're gonna blame me ?
henry .
and then you can 't take her home , ' cause you live at home .
that 's it !
what are you doing ?
i found the murder weapon .
you ever known shark skin to be smooth ?
it 's almost as if it was sanded down .
galeocerdo cuvier .. gc .
are genus and species .
one zero means 2010 .
and there are only a handful
and i think i know who i 'm going to talk to first .
at least , it was your shark until it took a dip
" if there 's a shark missing from my property ,
i got rid of it .
i called my guy ...
dr. holloway .
he came by , picked it up .
hey , asshole . do you know who this is ?
what 's your name , wise guy ?
how fucking appropriate .
see , this place is what you call sentimental value to my community .
now , you take the deal
you know ..
you see , i know the pain of a son
to grow up and one day own that very bar ..
first .... . you should have taken no for an answer .
i was gonna let that slide
oh , my god . oh , my god .
you okay ? how are you feeling ? i 'm okay .
i 'll see you later , all right ? okay .
hey , you okay , man ?
somebody just wanted to lend me an ear .

i 'm out of fucking reasons tonight .
we 're on the same fucking team , briggs .
what the fuck is that ?
all-around you .
thumb drive . nice .
i thought we were amigos .
not to mention you pissed off toro .

you just don 't know it yet .
you 're lucky i don 't have time to torture your ass .
please ...
look , i just run the club .
i swear it . what man ?
so , you 've seen him ?
that weird voice of his ....
you 'd either have to break your hip or let howard knock you up .
she 's actually been keeping herself busy
she wants to . after all , you were her maid of honor .
oh , right . yeah , oh , yeah .
no , no . no , no , no , no , no . i 'm sorry .
no ! i got to go .
someone baby-proofed the front door .
i mean , bernadette gave me all these bridal magazines .
never got ' em straight again .
you really understand my dilemma .
my mother is pushing for my brother ,
how are we gonna make these decisions
then we aren 't really making the decision ;
that decision only seems subjective .
if i may use a superhero analogy ..
okay , i 'll use real people .
if a best man with fake testicles hanging
so we break down each of the roles
if i had known getting married was going to involve so much science ,
oh , oh , i 'm starting a book .
he means he 's writing a book .
yeah . it 's about a brilliant physicist
it 's not about you .
they gave us plain rice instead of fried rice .
the woman must contain all the attributes of fertility .
certain carnal spots should be prominent ,
you chose intimate mode .
against my better judgments , activated nimani .
her behavior is not natural .
she does everything you want , but you don 't have to fight for it .
l don 't think you can have a relationship without any refusal , any struggle .
in one dimension , the cats alive .
the only way to find out ..
you never told me what she did to you .
it 's ..
this series of women without any soul .
bad outcome doesn 't mean that person was wrong .
come on , cut the crap .
this is perfectly customized advice just for you .
not as a part of sexual fantasy ,
ten , nine , eight , seven ,
i 'm okay . it hasn 't even been a year yet .
how are you getting along with nimani ?
it could be easier without her .
you said " we . "
operators fueled by personal frustration have proven to be solid employees
copy that .
are we still in the communication window ?
how come nimani 's supervising me ?
it runs on the latest tifa operating system .
wait a minute , you 're losing me here .
ls there any way to delete this cache memory of me ?
nd i can 't be an advanced user
some people feel nostalgic for nasa 's freeze-dried space foods .
that was engineered with people 's stomachs , not their brains .
no , it seems i 'm , like , your caveman .
i 'm a robot . i don 't drink wine . i know .
do you think we wouldn 't be having this argument
is that what you think ?
i love you so much , and look at what you do to me .
computing initiated .
if you uninstall the tifa software ,
l can just take this tablet , press the button ,
and why don 't you do that ?
okay . tell me , how do i become an advanced user ?
n case of emergency , pilot may become an advanced user
unauthorized activity detected .
the ship is off the slingshot path .
the only possible maneuver
advanced .
what is the only chance for completion of this mission ?
only i can thrust . allow me to log in to advanced mode .
the ship is back on course .
why the fuck don 't you obey me , then ?
why the fuck do you care if i touch you ?
you are punishing me .
no . rape is a standard fantasy ..
you promised me she won 't hurt me .
but that 's impossible . she obeys all the asimov 's laws .
hat ?
just don 't play with my feelings .
it 's all preprogrammed .
she 's a person .
should seek professional help .
your engineers have data on everything .
but you 're not able to create life .
we all failed .
what do you want from me ?
why not ?
you 're a robot .
there isn 't a person in the world who knows you more intimately than i do .
i didn 't meant to hurt you .
you projected them all inside me
you risked your life to make me .
if i 'm so menacing , why don 't you shut me down ?
comfirmed .
slipping into hibernation mode may ease the trauma ,
aren 't you supposed to recharge in a month ?
it seems you definitely lost it without tifa , huh ?
computer must shut down in ten ,
as for you surgeons ,
well , you can afford to slow down a little bit .
you 're very pregnant .
shepherd .
i need your help . come with me .
so you 've got your craniofacial baby .
no , he said elective .
i 'll put you on the o.r. rotation .
folks , they 're saying that this is going to be a bad one ,
thank you .
i-i tried to convince her to come down to l.a. with me ,
i wish there was , but honestly ...
i know .
the patient 's awake and responsive .
it 's bad , huh ?
the fact that we 're talking right now , leon ,
if these bars hadn 't caught me ,
just keep that up , okay ?
karev , what the hell happened ?
make sure he doesn 't die .
this one 's sitting right next to the carotid ,
and according to the ultrasound ,
these bars are rough metal . when we take them out ,
doctors , he 's starting to lose his airway .
that 'll take forever .
all right . just give me the grinder , and you can go .
this is dangerous work , people . so everybody out .
and you 'll need me to irrigate the metal .
that 's very good thinking .
no , grey , not you . you go .
she has a kid .
um , death , that 's pretty solid .
brooks .
why are you making me talk so much today ?
but you also have a natural talent for this .
so now it is my job to make you feel confident
i said fight the guy . i didn 't mean fight the guy .
now you 're supposed to be less stupid .
i don 't know . um , i need your help .
i found that on paul dawson 's scan .
yeah , that 's exactly what it is .
might be ' cause it was me who asked her .
she needs a break .
how about you pull out the bar ,
you know it was the same with arizona .
mm , that might be true .. for them .
okay . let 's go .
that is a handsome face .
i couldn 't have done it any better myself .

i looked at her , and she was my daughter .
it 's your jones , holmes .
i 'm sorry . i was just messing with you , okay ?
you mentioned this before at our last session .
no , no , that 's not an option .
i 'm bored , but i mean , that 's only part of it .
she 's a distraction .
you were going to talk to her about marriage and having a family .
you know what ? you 're right .
are you gonna ask her to marry you ?
i 'll pop the question . heh , heh .
as your therapist , i have to advise against that .
i 'm sorry i got you into this , bro .
i bet you 're a good student .
thanks for the drink . sure .
sorry i got you into this , bro .

uh , i 'm on shepherd 's service . good shepherd .
maybe we 're gonna be the next shepherds .
all right , guys . the day is as good as you make it .
come on !
in alt
so rather than a boring press interview ,
i 'll see you in the o.r ..
all right . okay , thanks .
why settle for another boring press release , right ?
i would love to see the procedure done firsthand .
you 're not gonna get a cardio fellowship
cristina yang is doing a solo aortic aneurysm today .
i 'll see you after we 're done .
any chance i could scrub in with you ?

c-can you explain anything that woman just said ?
here you go , sir .

she 's a ray of sunshine .
i 'm gonna go out on a limb
why can 't i see my baby ? what 's wrong ?
but dr. shepherd 's here .
the shepherds are the best
all right .
what took you so long ?
i had to make sure that the mother wouldn 't bleed out .
it 's pressing against the trachea .
no , you 're not ,
it is scary .
yeah , i already read the brochure .
uh , no .
we 'll use the renal vein .
someone page dr. bailey , please .
why aren 't you doing a tevar ?
a tevar is safer . it 's far less invasive .
i already ordered the graft .
i might have nicked the carotid .
did you get the whole tumor ?
i 'm not asking for myself .
you don 't publish , you don 't teach ,
what do they call me ?
trust me , you two don 't want to be the next shepherds .
you had no business shoving in there .
i wasn 't about to let that guy die
what are you talking about ?
she made a complete fool of me .
it 's all right . i 'm a doctor .
clear .
you know where i can find dr. shepherd ?
meredith .
don 't come and clean up after her again .
and it 's beneath you , and it 's pointless .
i want my brain in an android body .
i 'm with you .
i promised my mother .
well , there 's always the possibility that a trash can
they want us to present our paper
okay , if i may drill down to the bedrock of my question
which , if i were there , it would be .
leonard , please don 't take this the wrong way ,
hey , leonard , your mama 's research methodology is so flawed ..
sheldon , we have to do this .
we have to take in nourishment , expel waste ,
okay , let me put it this way , i 'm doing it .
come on , the only reason you 're the lead author
not to put too fine a point on it ,
excuse me , i designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis .
so the entire scientific community
you forbid it ?
so you admit that it 's our work ? no .
and once again you are welcome .
are you guys still not talking to each other ?
you know , like in the classic sci-fi movie scanners .
how about this one ?
wow , i didn 't know they still made corduroy suits .
okay , well , let 's just see
and this , and this , and these ..
no , this is stuff i want you to throw out .
you won 't be helping anyone .
anyway . i was talking to leonard this morning ,
i don 't understand the question .
oh , i hadn 't thought about it like that .
wait. what ?
just talk to him .
it 's certainly preferable to my plan .
a powerful laxative .
look , i know leonard values you as a friend ,
yeah , i mean , he tried to explain it to me .
it 's not science .
was the apple falling on newton 's head ,
no , no , that 's true .
you could not possibly be that arrogant .
look , if you weren 't happy with my presentation ,
i didn 't screw it up
i 've had enough of your condescension .
maybe i got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16 ,
we 'll take shifts . it won 't be hard .
bree 's got her trial .
what the hell is this ?
you said the trial was going well .
hey , lee ! sports talk .
i can 't do this anymore , gaby . i have got to step up .
how do you not feel guilty about this ?
we just have to hold on a little longer .
to prove a point about what an honorable guy you are ?
okay.but if things get any worse i 'll have no choice .
stop !
oh ! no . i still wanna sell .
the dead guy was her stepfather .
absolutely not.i 'm the client . you 're the lawyer .
it 's your call .
do you wanna come inside ?
ben and i are getting married next week ,
jane wasn 't the problem . it 's me .
i guess we can both agree ...
look ... i 'm sorry i missed the cake tasting , sweetheart .
leaves in her hair.she was ..
yes .
a shovel .
renee , what did you just do ?
what you said in there could really hurt bree .
friends aren 't supposed to turn on each other .
what is that supposed to mean ?
hey just so we 're clear , i didn 't want to testify against bree .
i made a promise to my friends .
do you understand that ? you are going to go to prison .
good . you should be scared .
i don 't understand .
i 'm also somebody who ... really ..
it was carlos .
or anyone else .
it was self-defense.alejandro broke into her house ,
and don 't worry , they 're taking the furniture .
well , l 'll tell them exactly what happened that night .
honey , it 's 2 : 00 in the morning . are you okay ?

why would i put you on the stand ?
i can testify that renee was so stinking drunk ,
i think i can , uh ... fit you in next monday .
do i look like i 'm gonna make it to monday ?
what the hell ? why don 't you take a seat ?
let 's not talk about that right now.i don 't want them seeing this on the news .
when you 're in a family like me and the girls ,
so when , uh , gaby 's stepfather came back .
your honor , had no idea .
i thought she was gonna discredit renee perry .
given the testimony of the last witness , l have to .
ms. stone ?
ms. stone , is there anyone else
all right , in that case .
that 's all .
gregg told me that you broke up with him
and just like that ,
we 'll just have a long chat once you 've settled in . okay ?
and this was the beginning .. of the end .
that , and i decided i just wasn 't into women anymore .
the women don 't shave , and the men carry purses .
i don 't know.it 's so big . it 's a whole department .
gaby , don 't you know how smart and talented you are ?
yeah.you know what ? you 're right .
i don 't even know how to talk to employees .
oh , please . that sad sack was a moron .
i 've been craving chocolate constantly .
mm , thank you .
is that your lawyer friend ?
i thought you liked him .
yeah , l didn 't want to brag in front of the girls , but it 's worth a few bucks .
well just look at our last financial statement .
oh ! have a seat .
she 's sleeping.i don 't think it 'll be long now .
no.this is our time together we 'll be fine .
not me . that lawyer guy .
karen told him she really wanted it .

so if you even give me one syllable of grief ,
let 's go inside and get started on our wedded bliss , eh ?
well , can you give me till the end of the day ?
look , bree ... all those ugly details you 're talking about , i ...
i don 't want to love an ideal.i wanna-i wanna love a real person .
all those years ago , when ...
that is the most shameful thing in my life .
fair enough .
i 'm sorry .
it was a tough time for both of us .
our roles are reversed now , but we can 't start drifting away from each other .
we should start there .
i 'd prefer to start in front ,
how intertwined they are .
i should really go with these spinal canals .
if i don 't relieve the pressure on her lungs ,
do you think she really wants to live ?
she doesn 't seem stupid . doesn 't even seem all that scared .
people do things every day
what are her chances of surviving the surgery ?
so is it worth it ? hey , come on .
she 's 43. it 's worth a try .
ok , but i think it 's worth talking to him again , pushing him
ok ..
it 's best you 'd not scrub in
you know , they call you the nazi .
dr. conserva , 3742 . dr. conserva , 3742 , stat .
the surgery is going to be long and difficult ,
there 's always that risk , but if we don 't do the surgery ...
i guess i 'll have the surgery .
on one condition . i don 't want him there .
if he 's in the surgery , i 'm not having it .
ok , miss connors .
what the hell did you do ?
man. the mike must have been on .
the micro shouldn 't have been on .
now you won 't realize your chance to scrub in .
i got the history on the tumor .
a year and a half it 's the first time she 's even had it looked at .
why doesn 't she get banned ?
you can 't ask me to scrub in , when i haven 't earned it .
you can 't treat me like crap when i haven 't earned that .
i got myself into this mess , and i ...
i don 't ... know that yet .
you did great work here today .
yeah ?
you didn 't .
tell you what , blondie .

no pulse. wide complex rhythm .
i need more suction . i need more .
it happened fast .

you opened a heart bedside ,
i paged you 50 times .
oh , man. the battery . i forgot to change it .
you are hateful !
ooh , i was kind of hoping to get it
well , he 's always saying
you know , i do work at a pharmaceutical company .
do you have any of these ?
he knows where the soup kitchen is .
i don 't think i like the way you 're treating my friend .
you want the book or not ?
friendship .
the mineral and rock show ?
so what am i supposed to do now ?
this isn 't funny .
i 've heard those words so many times .
too bad .
and now we go to reverse warrior .
well , to be honest , i thought she said " yoda . "
i support you .
namaste .
fine . i 'm not sure you should have quit .
oh , so now i need your permission ?
tunes with your chunks of cheddar cheese .
and here 's a lovely little story .

i don 't like you enough to let down the whole of year ten .
okay . sorry .
of one man only .
i know .
each week , a new song online .
we start with corden , then we move to kimmel ,
a couple of times .
fought hard to keep her , too .
fought hard for her ?
we have talked about this numerous times .
what do you mean ? i didn 't hijack the meeting .
yeah .
i 'm in commodities .
mark , i know you suffered a terrible loss .
i don 't talk about that .
no ... i don 't care , porter .
how long can that last ?
does it make you feel bored ? or stupid ?
wall street loves to use confusing terms
so here 's margot robbie in a bubble bath to explain .
they made billions and billions on their 2 fee
after all , there are only so many homes
thank you , benter .
by the way , these risky mortgages are called subprime .
so now he 's going to " short " the bonds .
good .
how do you know the bonds are worthless ?
look , i don 't think that they even know what they 've made .
it 's a time bomb , and i want to short it .
there are no insurance contracts or options for mortgage bonds .
lawrence .
and then
hey ! excuse me !
fine . okay , goldman . you 're right .
when he was a kid he excelled at studying
paul is a fine boy , and mark is an excellent student
he 's looking for inconsistencies in the word of god !
later , baum started his own fund on wall street
but then a tragedy happened to mark ,
the therapist called . you did it again .
i worry about you , mark .
you 're running around like you have to right every wrong in the world .
you 're so angry .
i 'm a mean guy and i 'm pissed off
they 're all getting screwed , you know .
or they care about what actress just went into rehab .
no , no . we agreed . if it interfered with work .
that 's never happened in history .
market and banks in popular culture ,
that 's a ood one .
if you offer us free money , we are going to take it .
i 'm sorry , are you for real ?
yes , that 's correct .
i went for subprime , and the gist was ..
bonuses aren ' for three months .
some fund manager from california .
a whole new way to make money , doug .
there are now . we made it for him .
i told you we 'd meet later .
never hung out with these idiots after work , ever .
apparently , this guy wanted $ 200 mil in credit default swaps .
somebody shorted $ 200 mil on mortgage bonds ?
mike , i consider myself a mentor to you .
lawrence , i have full autonomy
do not throw our inception agreement in my face , michael .
this is not crazy .
so , now we pay up premiums on these swaps
oh , hey , kathy , you busted me .
i 'm not your babysitter .
okay . hey , did i hear you 're expecting ?
lvf 's are cleaning us out but we 're staying positive .
... lump on my ball . and i go in for a scan .
and a hell of a trader .
that was a weird cal
and then in the middle of the call i realized he had the wrong frontpoint .
wow , it 's down ! it 's down three points since last year .
what was this guy 's name ?
that 's right . these lucky sons of bitches
i smell money .
okay , hi . how are you ?
okay , mr. vennett from deutsche bank . what do we have ?
so , how many people have you talked to about this trade ?
no ! my boss would have my ass ..
it 's just a meeting . it 's something like ...
people drink their coffee , they have a meeting .
1z es !
could we see some of your offering documents ?
it 's our money .
can you tell us how much you manage ?
but we started four years ago with $ 110,000 .
so , as you can see , that 's pretty phenomenal returns .
we got to call ben .
ben rickert was a former trader in singapore
dburt ben was dark .
he thought the whole world was going down .
you guys should start your own garden .
i used wood ash and urine to help restore the soil .
seeds are gonna be the new currency .
we 're gonna crunch the numbers like harder ..
of course . one second . yes , ma 'am . we 're going .
oh , come on . would you relax ?
mark wants us to check that out first .
because i heard the cuban food is amazing in miami .
hello ?
$ 425 , 000 each ?
hello . i 'm surveying mortgage owners who are over 90 days delinquent .
your landlord filled out his mortgage application using his dog 's name ?
wait , has that asshole not been paying his mortgage ?
well , yeah , he is over 90 days delinquent .
two years later , $ 480 , 000 .
this couple bought it for $ 650,000 ast year .
hi , john .
it will break his heart , but he 'll let it g0 .
neither one 's working right now .
as motivated as one can be in this neighborhood .
wow , a lot of people seem very motivated .
that 's all . just .
okay , let 's try number two out of 14 .
ben , why do you do that , man ? i mean ..
the nsa has a $ 52 billion budget and the ability
hey , i promise i will refrain from saying
did you get a chance to look at what we sent you , ben ?
hi , charlie . yeah , i did . hold on .
yeah .
that means this vennett guy 's not wrong
yeah , yeah . okay , so , you know , vennett mentions the cdos ,
we can 't even model them .
he didn 't even know what a coo is .
it 's like two plus two equals
we bought into a rigged game .
i 'm gonna have to move back in with my mom .
all right . well , i got a colonic appointment .
ben , look .
what ?
no way ! no !
are you serious ? you think this is a game ?
come on . i think it looks fun .
yeah , here we go . here we go .
chris , on my left . chris , on my left .
when do we get a chance to face time with some of these lovely folks ?
we 're gathering information , okay ?
we don 't want to spook everybody . can you do that ?
can you just keep it shut for a few days ?
yeah , don 't worry . we 'll play nice .
business is good .
and , yes , we had to take some losses
mark , it 's not a q and a .
i have a question , please .
but you know what ? you seem anxious . how can i help you ?
when we were in vegas , he did that .
yeah , the beretta ... meh .
i need this cdo machine to run for another two years .
brother , i will sell you as much as you want .
that 's cool . that 's all right with me .
don 't do that . stop . stop .
i appreciate that .
well , this is an opportunity for you to meet who you 're betting against .
okay , fine . who is this guy ?
i 'm a cdo manager .
yeah , at harding advisors .
we select the securities that go into the cdo portfolio
do you represent the investors or merrill lynch ?
you do .
mortgage bonds than actual mortgages ?
if the mortgage bonds were the match
and i know what you 're thinking .
okay . so here 's how a synthetic cdo works .
$ 10 million because this hand is meant to represent
dealer showing seven .
good odds . in fact , her chances of winning
everybody in this place wants to get in on the action .
how , this is a classic error .
a player makes a bunch of shots in a row .
he was in pain . my brother was in real pain .
it 's sad . it 's scary .
he told me .
saints don 't live on park avenue .
just feel the feelings like the rest of us .
i offered him fucking money !
subprime mortgage lender new century financial ,

i can 't help but enjoy it .
bye , kathy !
yeah . they 're unloading them .
let 's go to the press , man !
cobert pedford !
do you want me to write a piece called " we 're all fucked "
and they won 't devalue them until they et them off their books .
jamie ... and this is me being honest here , okay ?
no bank or ratings agency is going to confirm a story like this
i thought you were for real , casey . you know , i 'l have to say i really did .
yeah , jamie , you try being for real with a three-year-old
yeah , casey . i 've always hated you , because you were a prick in college
charlie , come on !
subprime bonds fell off a cliff
yeah , fuck you very much .
" and caesar wept , for there were no more worlds to conquer . "

but in the meantime , i still want oatmeal .
he 's impossible .
i believe what you meant to say is ,
we then eliminate those unqualified

and then ...
well , i 'm sure that zoo will be happy .
nobody 's ever seen a white one before .
i don 't think so .
why don 't you just fly his ass back ?
any change in atmospheric pressure
he was in the andes , now he 's at sea level .
so unfortunately , a boat was our only option .
another goddamn problem .

go keep those engines running .
loffler let most of the animals out .
i bagged them , and the bags are gone .
how many are there ?
well , we see ' em ,
if you see them , you call me .
you tell jerome , don 't go anywhere near the snakes .
and you brought the anti-venom ,
do you have any idea how irresponsible it is
it 's not what i mean .
what about the cat , walsh ?
is there another way to steer this thing ?
loffler asked the same question .
what are you doing ?
you just had to trap us all here .
now take that kid back to the safe hold .
forrest , you , and freed find loffler .
turn this boat back around .
well , i gotta crack the lines and bleed the air out .
then i got to change the filters .
i got to crank them over , and ...

and we 've suffered all kinds of casualties here ,
14 degrees , 20 minutes north .
we don 't have you on our screens , mimer .
16 degrees , 31 minutes north . 66 degrees , 43 minutes west .
affirmative .
i got deep intel on all of them , frank .
ease back , walsh , do it now .
come on , you got to hit a little harder than that , pussy .
i can 't seem to feel my legs .
hey ! listen , you want to ... you want to know ...
you 'll still be aware .
because ..
and i would appreciate it
how much do you want ?
they can be incredibly convincing .
we 're the national army .
and remember that humanity was always saved
you need to move . she 's interested , but make a move .

the message , damn it ! give me the message right now !
a system of chances to play roulette .
b is the chance of losing .

.... deputy commissioner reyes . at ten this morning ...
we have to prepare a rescue team .
shout my ass .
what 's going on ? lower your weapon .
we surrender !
this is your hell .
no , you take responsibility for neither .
your defeat forces you to .
i 'm responsible and i accept my punishment .
why ?
they 're persecuting us , it 's like an attack
they put a voice or an antenna inside me .
whenever i stop , they attack me again .
stop .
my potty and my mate .
and bring some hot water for the mate .
so , uh ..
'cause she lives , like , you know , a few miles away .
yeah , i i 'm planning to see her .
dr. hunt . i 'm not on trauma today ?
you mean the part where you asked her to move in with you ,
i was here for both
you don 't have to do everything i do .
look at what 's going on with stevens .
i got a plan
removing her hippocampus could compromise her memory , her speech .
on cancer patients ?
if you do the surgery , i could lose my memory ?
and if you don 't do the surgery ?
why take the chance ?
putting her brain to sleep
it 's unnecessary .
she 's having hallucinations .
like right now , for example
i didn 't let them cut out mine .
okay , one minute , i 'm this college kid ,
i had 15 surgeries .
forget it .
i come here every three weeks ,
but it might .
and once i get the prosthetic , then ..
you 're not her doctor . you 're swender 's resident .
derek ...
and this .
i did
well , i 'm gonna go now .
okay .
everything she had , everything she was .
in the end , she wasn 't even my mother anymore .
that is what we did . right .
oh , crap .
skin flap is done .
someone please remind me again .
if you don 't do this ,
we re doing what he wants .
we need more blood ! we need to move faster .
i didn 't see any bowel perforation .
dr. swender ..

where your eyes are supposed to be right now ,
i can 't live like this .
i don 't want any extraordinary measures taken
slide this notebook ... .
i 'll just be in the bedroom .

in fact , that 's the bare minimum to get to the plural " weeks . "
oh . good .
he 's a firefighter .
a potentially jealous man who 's handy with an ax .
guys , i mean , he 's around , okay ?
maybe those are his " after the holiday " pants ,
i mean , do you think it 's too soon for her to be dating ?
oh , well , i don 't even want to think .
what ?
first of all , you already look amazing .
i 'm gonna give him an extra day of crying .
yeah , you 're right . i totally felt it .
please , god , no .
which one of you is rajesh koothrappali ?
i am . i was just trying not to be racist .
is leonard around ?
it was the only option .
could you give me some guidance as to how to proceed ?
oh , i see .
it 's no big deal . i 'm just a little behind on my bills
it 's the stupid engine that stopped working .
you know , it occurs to me you could solve all your problems
hang on a moment .

oh , thanks .
a couple of months ago . it was back-ordered .

thanks , but no . she 's out tonight .
and the rest you put on me .

hmm . you don 't want to take the time ?
this isn 't my first s.t.e.p. procedure .
why are you making such a big deal ?
i taught you better than this . you 're out in the world now ...

no , no , no . no , i mean it 's really gonna screw me up .
i need every second to prep for this meeting .
i just wanted you to have half an hour of fun .
just wondering what beth would think if she could see us now ,
our hate was what killed her .
so maybe she 's thinking , " oh , great . now they get along . "
did she suffer at the end , in her last conscious moments ?
$ 1,000 ? y-you bet $ 6,000 ? what are you , nuts ? !
hands off the table , sir .
my friend ...
he died yesterday .
he said i was on a lucky streak .

i want to keep my family alive .
you 're probably right .
you want to get the base shut down ?
she 's not gonna say anything .
i have no road map .
out of all the agencies that are set up to protect us ,
there 's only one reason people do anything in this world .
i 've been in your shoes .
juggling a burgeoning outbreak and two kids ,

isn 't it funny ? i mean , how we 've lived
my roommate ? you mean linda ?
oh , god , they seemed so happy together . what was his name ?
what was his name again ?
here we go .
it 's the worst timing for me , ever !
truth is , it 's nice to have some company for a change .
why don 't you tell us your life story ?
yeah ?
so they run a bunch of tests
then i go home , turn on the tv , and they say three weeks .
that 's when you find yourself renting a gun and buying a bullet .
isn 't that right , dodge ?
no , i guess not .
you wanna join me ?
okay , what a fucking weirdo .
who drives around with shovels ? i don 't trust him .
yes , and thank you for that , by the way .

well , what 's it gonna be , then ? knife ? piano wire ?
don 't tell me they sent a girl to do a man 's job .
unless you 're some sort of team ! is that how this works ?
well , that 's a relief .

you are looking at a vindicated man .
i don 't really have any .
my mother passed away ,
it only took armageddon to give her the courage .
your roommate was your wife .
should have listened to my mother .
you would have liked her .
and she knows her best chance of survival
sure .
there 's no room for you , dude .
i 'll go check the bedrooms .
i mean , we wouldn 't steal anything .
then this one time , benny ,
oh , wow . how long was i out ?

you picked the tomatoes , you made the sauce .
yes , i harvested the wheat .
i don 't know . it was the best i could do ,
how could anyone abandon this face ?

if it gets me out of cooking , i 'm there .
oh . wait . susan was already coming to our place .
well , i suppose she 'll want overtime ,
oh , come on .
of course . you know how she loves children .
what are we doing ? :
i figure 12 more laps , and she 'll be asleep .
you know what ?
sleep train ?
yeah , i know what it is .
the point is she learns to put herself to sleep .
before long , everyone 's happy .
i met a woman today a-at the store .
she said you killed martha huber .
she said you had a motive .
thank you for letting me off the hook .
well , you found out your son was dating
it wasn 't just that .
oh . is , uh , everything okay ?

she stared screaming at me ..
when he showed up and knocked on the door ,
finally , it stopped .
i didn 't notice it so much when i was a child .
why 's that ?
hey , guys .
whoa . hold on . isn 't that a little extreme ?
i cannot stand by and listen to that baby cry .
even for one minute . if 's more than i can handle .
i cry myself to sleep because my kid is crying .
god ..
i haven 't even gotten to speak to mike .
well .. it 's either talking to your husband

carlos and i hired our friend bob .

and break our two-night-in-a-row rule ?
okay , you slept two hours last night .
okay .

you should trot that out with your new friends .
you 're running yourself ragged
unless you 're admitting it too soon .
" oh , yeah . live . "

but , uh , if i 'm not mistaken ,
i 'm trying to get something started here .
are you actually suggesting ...
our way of life is under attack .
i have to go .
that 's all . just think about it .
worth a shot , huh ?
no , that 's not what i meant .
that 's dr. stieglitz .
he 's brilliant and scary and impossible to impress .
okay . i 've made an appearance .
come on , now , alex .
dad , ijust ..
i had to cheer for the debate team once .
" damn . might as well ask schrodinger 's cat . "
you 'd think animal planet , but it was mostly cinemax .
alex , get in here .
yes , quite , quite .
it was so embarrassing .
he doesn 't fall for people who pretend to understand him
but seriously , i-i have a science question
had it .
i had three model rockets as a kid ,
yeah . my dad bought it before he , you know ,
could never bring myself to open it without him .
no , it 's not silly .
ah , yes , disappointing fathers .
i remember for my 16th birthday , my dad bought me a mercedes .
he had barely handed me the keys
anyway ..
well , that 's perfect .
well , if you want to see it again , i got it on video .
thank you for your support .
i was being sarcastic .
sheldon , what am i gonna do ?
what do you know about raising a girl ?
well , i don 't know if that was sarcasm or not .
i was worried you might not check your e-mail .
that one was not me .
my mother 's texting you ?
why ?
she 's been reaching out .
you think you 're getting close to her ,
live , sheldon . i want to live .
hi , pen ...

daddy , i wanna play with my car now .
but remember , we have to walk down the receiving line .
cam , y-you got her a car ?
then when he comes in and turns it on ,
he 's here early ! hurry up !

nobody 's going to make fun of you .
i just gave them a full-blown sex scandal .
ay , no .
you stay in there !
i do ! i do ! come out !
gloria , tag out . let me give it a shot .
nice game of chicken , claire . she 's gone !
almost ? !
you were wrong about the ipod being a failure .
i don 't even want to talk about your favorite " planet " pluto !
you were going to let me go with him ? !
are you worried ?
not even a little bit .
he 's right , the nobel prize is about the work ,
now , the university is gonna host
uh , yeah . who needs to be likable
that 's what 's great about you ,
nope . i 've been trying to get them down for hours .
why doesn 't he like the night-light ?
we can also find out what 's so damn funny about birds .
i don 't know why she 's suddenly so afraid of everything .
hey , sweetie ,
your daddy , when he was in space .
hey , good news .
oh , great , like who ?
look how tiny and scared you look .
that is so cool .
why ?
maybe you should 've called it the bitchy little astronaut .
the fact is , i feel really bad for amy .
well , she didn 't do anything wrong ,
but more than the person , the nobel is about the work .
yes , because of your work on gravitational waves .
i do . but i 'm-i 'm really hogging this conversation .
just give them a chance .
look at , uh , newton , who was a jerk to leibniz ,
conducted illicit affairs ,
so , what did everybody think ?
i thought the character of madame bovary was very inspirational .
the south side are miscellaneous items .
that 's smart . you 'll probably have to sleep in it for a while .
no ? that 's mr. conlin , the locksmith . he 's been very helpful today .
ok , fine . you win . i won 't go to new york .
that sounds fascinating
oh ! and you gotta try the cincinnati chili .
they make it here with cinnamon and chocolate
i 'll try to , yeah . thanks .
a toy store ?
yeah , toy store .
it 's open all night .
i have a pickup call at 16th and lincoln .
anyway , there 's a lot to see in the city .
you know , i 'm sorry . i 'm not getting that .
i 'm just here for a day .
you don 't need more than a day for the zoo .
welcome , mr. stone .
smoking , king-sized bed .
one night . yes .
i 'd like a quiet room , if you have one .
i have a charming deluxe smoking
so it 's all set then .
oh , thank you . right this way , sir .
after you , sir .
it was fine , thanks .
i 'm sorry ? no .
i think the room will be to your liking , sir .

if you need anything at all , please just give us a ring
touch the door to the room .
fill the tub with water , soak a towel ,
hmm ?
oh , i love portuguese .
they sing in portuguese in brazil , a little-known fact .
it 's an anomaly , right ? uh-huh .
i ike that word .
i feel like an anomaly .
now i kind of like it . sometimes .
it makes me special , sort of .
no . now here 's what i 'm thinking .
i want to be with you .
i need to be with you . i want to leave my wife .
michael , that 's a big decision . i don 't
i mean , i don 't want to be responsible
it 's been years since i 've felt anything like this .
yeah , that sounds right .
you 're clicking your fork against your teeth .
oh , sorry .
what do i say ? do i smile while i 'm on the phone ?
did you know that ?
try it , go ahead .
have no one to talk to . i have no one to talk to .
i just don 't know what else to do because .
be friendly to the customer .
i want to cry , but i can 't .
is it the zoloft ?
i sweat onto my pillow every night .
be friendly .
look for what is special about each individual .
our time is limited . we forget that .
soon it 's as if we never existed
someone to love .
1emember to ..
it 's an antique , slugger . that 's part of its charm .
what are these words here ?
i don 't .. who are all these people ?
yeah . oh , thanks .
what 's it doing now , daddy ?
oh , sweetie , guests don 't normally
i never went to my prom .
would you like to dance ?
you 're not exactly winning any trophies
why shouldn 't they be ?
in some cultures , we 'd stand outside of their bedroom
oh , come on , honey .
you can 't see anything .
ha ! the eagle has landed !
want to come in , have a cup of tea ?
'kay . well , good night .
ames , hi . how was the wedding ?
come in , let 's talk .
wine is one of the reasons i 'm in this fix .
okay , forget giant ants .
big or small , i don 't like rabbits .
rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size .
maybe that 's what they want to talk about .
really ?
what do you want from me ? i just don 't give a rat 's ass .
for the record , giant rats are possible .
maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet ?
it tells me that i am living rent-free right here .
oh , i 'm ready .
when she 's upset , she says , " ack ! " and eats ice cream .
if you were a cat , i would have brought you a lasagna .
no , we haven 't spoken since your abrupt departure last night
yeah , i 'm sorry about that .
oh , honey , i don 't know .
you want me to remove him from the team ?
no , no , that 's okay .
oh , i think we both know the answer to that question .
wha ... . ? no , it 's okay .
everything 's good .
so , you didn 't get all snarky
i 'm glad you patched things up with your boyfriend .
it 's always tough when the " l " bomb gets dropped
i dated this one girl ,
now i 'm ready .
these all used to be homes .
mm . kingston manor .
bad people .
i remember a lot of good families
alicia , listen .
that car won 't run , and my leg is messed up , okay ?
i don 't want to slow you down .
it 's my hood .
no , i don 't think i 'm better than you ,
mm-mm .
you haven 't lived my life .
of course i do .
i begged you to come with me .
yeah ? well , you should 've stayed gone .
he just seems kind of broken .
really ? over a theory ?
the more you care about something ,
yeah . what can we do to help him ?
every culture has its own rituals and traditions
look , i get that you 're scared , but we just have to push past that .
it 's over-the-top
you seemed like you were so happy ,
i just wanted you to have your dream ,
but if i 'm gonna go through with this ,
stop trying to make this your victory !
i 'm just looking to see

i 'm just saying to keep your head down , that 's all .
you 're a kid .
this was payback .
i 'm sorry , i can 't believe you would say something like that .
then talk to cohen .
all we do is plant a bug and we can hear everything he says .
no , his house .
hey , guys , do you want in on this ?
those are the locations of some of the books around town .
i don 't know what it is yet .

you got something to tell me , romeo ?
it didn 't look like nothing .
hey , guys , guys . i just heard something about a heroin shipment . shh .
we know who you are .
let 's get out of here .
in the legs just as much as the next guy .
playing hot potato with a grenade isn 't much of a strategy .
not gonna make it more than a week .
get in the car .
someone hit the shipment .
who hit the shipment ?
it 's not good right now .
come on , everybody . get over here .
sarge , come here .
for bringing us all home safe .
no , look , this victory belongs to all of us .
cheers .
nothing .

we never had that kind of trouble before .
i 've bought myself enough cops . i know what i 'm talking about .
they 're hard cases , not interested in money .
there 's no medicine for it , you just gotta ..
it 's a matter of time before he gets to me .
gracie , look , for whatever it 's worth .... ..
don 't run . just stay .
we 'll get to you in a minute .
hey , we got a message from mr. cohen .

i don 't know how to live .

you lose everything and you lose the war ...
this is sergeant john o 'mara of the los angeles police department .
come out quietly with your hands up and you will not be harmed .
i like having only one fork .
fucking had it .
it 's 6 : 55 .
it 's one hour
keep walking , bull , keep walking .
yo , i got a late start .
block the gate . i got to finish this off .
said a prayer for us all
just a half cup , mack
it doesn 't mean anything . it 's a rubber-chicken dinner .
you don 't do that to your candidate ,
how can you not understand this is so beyond me .
listen to me
be presidential ,
i 'm figuring i 'll need a two-inch lift ,
what do you think ?
i ain 't a hero for $ 14 an hour .
i don 't know , sir .
you think he knows i 've been barking up one of his trees .
this is richard sullins .
which means
well , let 's be clear ,
now , i 'm sorry
that i was supposed to put around my neck .
18 months ?
is that so ?
forensics is prepared to submit a report detailing
and the escaped con who says that i told him to kill himself .
you can erase me , too .
you know ...
what ?
that 's some real fine work , wheeler .
if i do that , i 'll be cutting .
you know the golden rule of line etiquette :
boy , makes me feel better about my life .
and now i feel worse again .
he 's battled intimacy issues his whole life .
didn 't even make it out of the parking lot .
let 's talk about you .
dear , i 'm a psychiatrist .
well , i 'd actually like for us to be close ,
penny , it 's only natural to want your mother-in-law to like you ,
uh , for starters ,
you were happy to do this when i hired you .
oh , i 'm not upset with you , but amy 's pretty bent out of shape ,
oh , thanks ! you 're a peach !
bernadette , it was a pleasure as always ,
since the airport , dear .
really ?
do i think he 'd be interested ?
wonderful !
um , you should probably talk to penny , too .
okay , you know what ?
i 've been trying to make a connection with you all day ,
what i was seeking was some sort of friendship .
my intention was never to insult you .
but as we get older , making amends ..
you really think i should lie ?
but , you know , whatever. take care now .
i got you a present .
even if you are a fancy plastic surgeon
it 's not money
it 's better than money . wait .
it either means , " you 're dying , and i can 't help "
or it means . " this is really gonna hurt . "
in a few weeks , i 'm gonna be up a tree in utah .
sons of bitches !
uh , you were bulldozed out of something ?
she was the tree that i was living in for the past six weeks .
kaili is hawaiian , for " divine beauty and wisdom . "
they 're all gone .
those corporate bastards !
how does one exactly live in a tree ?
he 's , um , asking where your poo goes ,
excuse me , doctor .
can i help you ?
oh , gosh . i 'm gonna pretend that you didn 't just call me ma am , "
well , i am looking for a doctor .
um , isobel stevens
after you .
my god ! who 's getting married ? !
what are you doing here ?
but there 's a trauma coming in .
please .
the chief specifically asked me to cover mer in the pit .
finish his catheter .
what can we infer from these injuries ?
let 's make sure we get an accurate count while we have him positioned .
does it hurt when i do this ?
can you tell me how you got this big cut on your face ?
she 's scared she did a bad thing and you 're gonna take her away from me
her daddy shoots targets in the backyard .
it was stupid . it was really stupid .
okay you 'll tell the police that and it 'll be okay .
i 'm so deeply sorry
thank you
and then you remember jade from 114 ? well ..
you used to do all those little exercises like this
nothing 's stopping . he 's still bleeding out .
i need some more suction in there
because i have to deal with him
he doesn 't respect it
okay
so im begging you , please . he 's not invited , okay ?
thank you mm-hmm
you are not a defenseless , tree-living creature karen .
mom ...
i have stage iv melanoma
that doesn 't make a whole lot of sense .
no . no .
just breathe , okay ? it 's okay .
now ive got a good feeling about this .
really ? you think that
take easy . l-listen , if it 's not , it 's not the end of the world .
yeah . a bucket on a pulley .
oh , that 's friendship .
you know , they teach us in med school
we do a thousand different things to care a little less .
nice work , yang .
open it and pour it into a sterile basin
uh , uh , we used it in the field all the time .
oh. look at that it 's locking up the entire wound. it
magical
mets ? like baseball ?
okay , uh , good news great news .
it looks like your psychic was right , mrs. stevens .
oh , thank you , god ! thank you .
oh , thank you ! oh .
you told her about the ring .
that 's not running a hospital .
you have history with her .
but the way you act you consider her family .
what happened ?
the guy shouldn 't be alive . 17 bullets .
dr. grey meredith
i know i was out of line , and i know
reminds me of a guy in germany
what happened at cruising altitude ?
brody , let 's order some , uh , bilateral leg films .
but the ice pack is made of blood and muscle tissue ,
ew . gross .
meredith 's kind of lucky , when you think about it .
well , i mean , yeah , obviously ,
i love a good dare .
thank you .
good to be back ?
but i love being a mom , too .
how amazing and important and just perfect it is ?
i will pass it along .
all right .
the heart 's not stopping .
well , it looks like the blunt injury
how can i help ?
uh , no . a great time , in fact .
there 'll be cake any minute .
it was never meant to be published .
from " hospital hell " ?
and i would never say that .
then have them change it . have them take it down .
i can write a retraction , an explanation .
only a girl would be afraid to come down the ladder .
i 'm not looking at a little girlie-girl , am i ?
come on .
aside from the adultery , yes .
i would find a way to forgive them .
and you deserve such a special woman .
i don 't know . it happens a little bit at a time .
it 's not complicated . it 's completely irresponsible .
so you 're the victim ?
we 're not done .
i can 't believe you 're just uprooting us like this .
here . you wanna get it about like this .
just flashes from when i was little .
what kind of things ?
and dana .
don 't fall for it .
exactly . a very beautiful , classy lady .
obviously , i 'm not leaving my husband and marrying john .
i 'll talk to john tomorrow and give back the ring .
hey , bob , i get why she 's so angry with me .
you 're right . you 're right . i guess i just got so upset because ..
it 's over . i 'm sorry . good night .
i know . of course . you 're not your father .
because if you ever betray me . i will leave you .
how am i supposed to patch it out here ?
i 'm not always gonna be here to help you .
why did you and mom name me after something that 's bad ?
what it means is whatever can happen will happen .
get in .
what about the flat tire ?
this way :
nicely done .
delhi mission control went down , same as ours
why did it come down so low ?
maybe the sun cooked its brain or it was looking for something
come on . you 're a well-educated man , coop .
and an engineer .
we didn 't run out of television screens and planes . we ran out of food .
the soviets bankrupted themselves pouring resources
one of those useless machines they used to make was called an mri .
then she 'd have been the one listening to this instead of me ...
but six billion people ... just try to imagine that .
his world isn 't so bad
and your kids know it . especially murph .
at our place in the stars .
cooper , you were good at something ..
i 'm sorry .
to turn on you like that and destroy you .
this happened about 1 : 30 when that thing ... came off the top of that canyon .
kind of an accident . we sort of stumbled upon it . we were on a salvage run ..
nobody stumbles in here . nobody stumbles out .
what sort of anomaly ?
you 're going to have to be specific , mr. cooper . right now
now , i 'm real happy that you 're excited about gravity , bud
like , that we 're getting out of here . and i don 't mean in the trunk of some car .
no , professor , i don 't .
we 're nasa .
for refusing to drop bombs from the stratosphere onto starving people .
in secret .
because public opinion wouldn 't allow spending on space exploration .
blight .
now there 's just corn .
but like the potatoes in ireland and the wheat in the dust bowl
earth 's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen . we don 't even breathe nitrogen .
the last people to starve will be the first to suffocate .
will be the ast to survive on earth .
yeah . thank you .
we 're not meant to save the world . we 're meant to leave it
our final expedition .
get out there and save them .
we started detecting gravitational anomalies almost 50 years ago .
tn fact , i believe you encountered one yourself
exactly .
and it leads where ?
a wormhole 's not a naturally occurring phenomenon .
" they " ?
that wormhole lets us travel to other stars . it came along right as we needed it .
twelve , in fact , from our initial probes .
we sent people into it . ten years ago .
twelve possible worlds , twelve ranger launches carrying .
each person 's landing pod had enough life support for two years .
then they could send out a signal , bed down for the long nap , wait to be rescued
some clue as to which worlds have potential .
one . that 's a bit of a long shot , isn 't it ?
no long shot .
this entire facility 's a centrifuge .
both . flan a. " how do you get it off the ground ?
so i started working on a theory and we started building this station .
that 's why there 's plan b .
plan b : a population bomb .
how would you raise them ?
within 30 years , we could have a colony of hundreds .
this takes care of that .
you give up on them ? my kids ?
i give you my word .
murph .
this world was never enough for you , was it , coop ?
and it excites me ? heh .
it might . don 't trust the right thing done for the wrong reason .
tom will be all right , but you got to make things right with murph .
you have to talk to me , murph .
then i 'll keep it broken so you have to stay .
she said , " now .
once you 're a parent , you 're the ghost of your children 's future .
that 's right , murph .
i can 't be your ghost right now .
murph , they chose me . you saw . you 're the one who led me to them .
i figured out the message .
murph .
we have each other . dr. iann had it worse
no , it 's not like looking for a new condo .
adrift
they all knew the odds against ever seeing another human being again .
how about tann ?
why are you in my dad 's truck ?
he sent you a message .
if you record any messages , i can get them to transmit it to cooper .
maybe i should fan the flame .
so maybe she should come and make a fool out of you .
heading for mars .
administration wants me to repeat plant pathology . which sucks .
all right , i got to go , dad . hope you 're safe up there .
i asked murph to say hi , but she 's as stubborn as her old man .
you all right , rom ?
of course it is . what , you .... . ? you thought it would just be a hole ?
in the illustrations , they 're trying to show you how it works .
but it 's too far , right ?
we 're .
so the lost communications came through .
the relay on this side cached them .
miller 's site has kept pinging thumbs up , as has dr. mann 's .
transmitter failure ?
but miller 's still looks good though , right ?
it 's what we 're calling the black hole .
and miller 's is on the horizon ?
landing there takes us dangerously close .
the gravity on that planet will slow our clock compared to earth 's drastically .
every hour we spend on that planet will be .
jesus .
well , we can 't just drop down there without ..
yeah , doyle , we have a mission , and our mission plan a is ..
i am thinking about my family and millions of other families , okay ?
no . it doesn 't . that 's why there 's a plan b .
all right , look .
and edmunds ' , it 's even further .
you don 't find that every day . no , you don 't .
that would be spent trying to get back here .
just back from the cusp .
right .
here 's gargantua . here 's miller 's planet .
which would conserve fuel , but we would lose a lot of time
if we could just see the collapsed star inside ...
and we can 't get anything from it ?
not even light .
then let 's succeed
with respect , professor , we 've tried that hundreds of times .
every rivet that they strike could have been a bullet .
finish it with one arm .. no , with both arms tied behind your back .
i 'm an old man , murph .
i want to talk to my daughter .
murphy 's law . whatever can happen will happen .
but when you 're orbiting a black hole not enough can happen .
we need to go further afield .
and yet ... yet here he is .
granted , but edmunds ' data is more promising .
well , if we vote , there 's something you should know .
that has nothing to do with it .
you 're a scientist , brand
observable , powerful .
love has meaning yes . social utility , social bonding , child rearing
yet understand .
artifact of a higher dimension that we can 't consciously perceive .
love is the one thing we 're capable of perceiving ..
maybe we should trust that , even if we can 't understand it yet .
yes .
that doesn 't mean i 'm wrong .
it might .
i need to vet back .
i need to .
we might have something for that . hey , coop .
lois , i have a friend who ..
no , this wasn 't a personal decision .
your fuel calculations are based on a return journey .
starting a colony could save us from extinction .
and the future of the human race
we were trying to reach you .
i 'm here , professor .
no , you got us so far . real close .
pray you never learn ...
i hadn 't a lot of hope to begin with , but
the last time i went to sleep , i didn 't even set a waking date .
yeah ?
yeah , what 's that ? have one last crack at the black hole .
yeah , i know . this isn 't going to cost you any time .
talk to me .
what happens after it crosses ?
so , what 's to say there isn 't some way that the probe ..
if he 's equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse .
tas is the obvious candidate
how long have you had that cough ?
mom lets me play in here .
just take this gently .
dad 's not coming back . he never was coming back . it 's up to me .
dad didn 't even try ! dad just abandoned us !
you gonna wait for your next kid to die ?
neither of us has time to worry .
i 'm sorry , cooper .
apparently .
roger . i have it .
t can do this . i can do this .
not just any child .
murph , the fire 's out ! come on !
i get that , ta rs .
cooper .
say that again .
no , they didn 't bring us here at all .
nice and easy , mr. cooper .
take it slow , sir
currently orbiting saturn .
nice of you to name it after me .
the station isn 't named after you , sir . it 's ... named after your daughter .
i was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect .
of course , i didn 't speak to her personally .
glasses or cups , whatever it was , upside-down .
there just wasn 't enough food .
i don 't care who describes it , there is no way for it to be exaggerated .
oh , she did , did she ?
home sweet home . everything replaced and put back where it .
oh , yeah .
i do , yeah , so many things ...
jesus .
eddie cantor , only not totally jewish looking .
if you knew susie like i know susie ...
it would be easy if i was , sancho .
but i am bound to honor the code of knight-errant .
i 'm very sorry .
oh never was there a knight
you can 't blind me with your mirrors .
keep away !
shit . what did i do ?
javier , come back !
well , he 's my ride .
you and your film destroyed good people !
that 's what they want you to do .
it is our story , sancho , not some pretend ...
great fortune smiles on us .
my fair lady has forgiven me .
tell her that don quixote de la mancha ,
have you learned nothing at my side , hmm ?
it 's 100 % colombian , it 's right there on the table .
i just don 't think i want you seeing me like this .
you know , i kept calling out for you in emergency .
they thought that you were the one who ..
i don 't know .
so i had a date last night .
there were three guys inside .
he spoke real strong , like a fighter .
this is a housekeeper you 're talking to , remember ?
glad you don 't .
he 's from a fine old italian family back east .
how big are they ?
you did me something once .
but now , i need you to do me something .
don 't mind the noise .
it 's just a short drive down the block .
this isn 't as nice as some of those other places .
how did you get into this line of work ?
trained to run around all commando .
" s " for shut your mouth .
i can take care of things . that 's all you need to know .
are you always so touchy ?
can i get a fiji water , please ?
nicky ? vodka double
i want my revenge , nicky .
i 'm here to see mr. delarco .
it 's personal .
i don 't think baby is gonna be too happy with me stuck out here .
no , you keep it all .

we had this kind of going away thing
11 : 50 . ten minutes .
well , i 've been killin ' everyone tonight , nicky .
changing 100 .
thank you , veronica .
cyrus is a pretty shitty name .
but cyrus seems like the overwhelming choice .
inda .

you 're not supposed to like vegas .
sweet dreams .
i 'm gonna sail the mediterranean before i die .
that 's very kind of you , duke .
i don 't get you .
five years would only be fine at first .
not today .
i lied about my friend recommending you .
i knew everything about you , i 've researched you .
and the double vodka .
i need something from you and i 've come too far for a no answer .
i got so fucking mad
and so i 've come to you .
you want to sail the mediterranean ,
i earned 70 million dollars by the time i was 19
it was nothing
you 've got to help me .

he could kill you with this
it 's the perfect cover .

you 're not buying this crap , are you , baby ?
you know what ? i 'm not stripping

you watch your fuckin ' back !
he 's a very macho little slime .
you know he 'll come for you .
really needed this now .
maybe it 's not so terrible .
okay , duke . i admit it .
'm a trapped compulsive
no , but you might have taken
doubtful for two reasons , the first being the lack of funding .
now i 'm going to have to hire an emergency crew to come
are you insane ? max , i can 't .
come on .
isn 't this one of those " windows of opportunity " ?
i had to stay on scene .
why did you call 911 in the first place ?
wait , wait ! open ! open !
tartar ? not a shred of meat .
little bit of this , little bit of that .

where are you at with family support ?
what is this ?
and you 're still short a 150 .

he tried to start another fight .

that 's my sister-in-law 's . jane , good news .
hi , jane . i 'm dr. avery .
it 's bad , honey .
this is all gigantor 's fault .
i didn 't mean to pull so hard .
he didn 't suggest to play tug-of-war with a clothesline .
okay , kellers , i 'm back
we can 't eat , al .
the condition is fatal .
we 'll let you hold him when he 's stable ,
and if you don 't make it in time , he could die ?
it 'll give us more time .
can you do that ?
there are about a thousand reasons why not .
nobody cares . karev ? all right .
it was the height of idiocy ,
i cover the sophomore beat for my school paper .
and now my hand is ruined and my career is over .
your hand is going to be just fine .
okay ? and ...
okay ?
all right . so do you have any questions before we start ?
can i get that back ?
but what if it 's not ?
no ! stop .
not right now .
and you all know that when he comes out ,
your baby 's life depends on it ,
we 're all doing our best to save your baby 's life .
okay . one more time . one more time .
right .
just confirm what i have so far .
you don 't even have to say anything .
let it go , woodward .
it 's not the hospital . it 's one doctor .
she 's been isolated ,
the o.r. has been tested . it 's clean .
do what you have to .
you cleared to scrub in ?
okay , prep him .
of course not .
baby 's looking good .
dr. miranda bailey .
but the real culprit here is the gloves .
we switched
microscopic tears in the gloves , which facilitated
mr. cleaver went on to demand an immediate ...
what ?
i thought the move would be
my mother gave us that rug .
it 's just a comic , jack .
it 's not just a comic .
yeah .
working on your suntan , huh ?
well , you 're in luck , soldier .
we know this because we are everywhere they are .
hakim abdullah jamal .
i 'll get the sheets and blankets for the couch .
no , i can 't authorize that .
the hammurabic code is " an eye for an eye , "
and a living will and durable power of attorney .
as your friend , let 's hope it doesn 't come to that .
did you sign this ?
you get to pull the plug on him , too .
congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard .
what 's wrong with me , penny ?
you know , if we weren 't friends ,
okay , okay . mom , i gotta eat something before school .

when he came into a room , people noticed .
what ? why ?
but he was just bold .
yeah . wow . i 've never heard any of this about him before .
well , you 've come to the right tavern . table 12 .
that 's a children 's menu .
now ...
i 'm sorry , but you are not getting this map .
okay , i can handle this .
i followed my gut .
but the expressway is faster .
i know you want this to be

your boys are in grave danger ! but i can help !
i know where they 're going ! we can still save them !
i don 't .
i mean , okay , well ...
i mean , i 'm late for work .
i mean tired . sick and tired . gotta go !
old gore can 't be tied down .
can you put me through to officer colt bronco ?
the magic said it for you .
magic doesn 't get it wrong !
right ?
all i know is that everything we 've done tonight has gone wrong .
are you kidding ?
but you didn 't do it my way .
great ! then i think we should take the path of peril .
see ?
all that matters today is dad ,
what is he doing ?
he is terrible .
no . here he comes .
i 'm good . stop .
no , no , no !
just imagine what the top half of this dance looks like .
great !
hello , old friend . we shall never part again .
so , let 's call it 10,000 .
colt , i can 't talk . the boys need me .
dang those kids .
well , good morning to thee , dear lightfoot men .
it 's not much of a path .
so , heads up , we could run into anything .
look around for a lever .
but it 's on the other side .
aloft elevar .
so , what other spells do you know ?
i know all there is to know of magic .
we just have to get to them before they unleash the curse .
a what dragon ?
i just know we have to get to the boys fast .
well , i almost had ' em , but ian , he just drove off .
what ?
thinks something 's gonna come at him out of the ...
are you okay ? where did you come from ?
are you all right ?
no . our transport !
come on , pixie dusters , let 's take to the skies .
how do you feel about exercising those wings ?
careful how much boat you 're eating there , man ,
i can 't believe i 'm this close to actually talking to dad .
if he ever gave himself a wizard name .
well , ' cause he was into magic .
alora the majestic .
anyway , it 'll just be nice to have more than four memories of him .
the phoenix gem is just on the other side .
this place is , like , 1,000 years old .
oh , no .
the penthouse .
why i even knocked on the door is beyond me .
.. nobody knows what that means . it 's safer for everybody involved .
we 're just the middle men .
right .
that 's ... that 's limitless .
it could have no downside . i mean , except for your russian partners .
ok , so how do you think haggerty fits in ?
haggerty 's gonna be indicted any minute now , ok ?
that 's the truth .
yeah , well , i just think this business is questionable as it is ,
i don 't know , not right about it . you know ? the guy 's saving our life .
it wouldn 't be haggerty . it would be me . i 'd be the one at risk .
we wouldn 't provide a frame of content .
and then i did the right thing . i took care of haggerty
yeah . these guys are lunatics .
wait a minute . just hold it .
nice . i 'll ... i 'll take the money .
i 'll take it , yeah .
they said they owed $ 400,000 ,
i figured with the potential of the business ,
within an hour , some big russian named ivan was at my door .
can i get you a drink or anything ?
ok , i 'm just trying to be friendly .
your money ? i thought this was nikita 's money .
what are we gonna do ?
what about the money ?
the guy 's dead . what do you . ?
right , but they don 't know that , so that 's how we need to keep it .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
hey , you ok ?
here you go . will you hold these ?
yeah .
you can 't eat those , honey .
ok , let 's go get something to eat .
wherever you want .
you ok , baby doll ?
it 's so nice to have you home .
some eat plankton , some eat other fish .
look , have one of these .
nikita , you wanna .. you wanna tell me what 's going on ?
i don 't know what to tell you about that . maybe he 's off partying ,
four
well , that 's not what he told me .
i 'm not saying anything , all right ?
no offense here , but it 's sounding to me like you might have gotten ripped off .
after a few months , the warehouse owner asked us to move .
in no time at all , we had enough money to buy our own building .
go slow with that one .
every time i came home , it was this wonderful homecoming .
hey , sugar .
but i knew it couldn 't last .
dad !
i was throwing houses , gifts and cars
all right , so let me guess .
your wife and kids become total strangers ,
sorry . i didn 't mean to strike a nerve or anything .
i mean , and you 're making what ? close to 100 million ?
that ain 't right . that ain 't right .
" thanks for putting this all together , jerry . "
really ?
yeah , well , see , the problem is i don 't really see it like that , jack .
no . no , you see , we 're not finished .
we can 't be . listen , you killed ivan , right ?
hey , fuck jack . and that little plan of yours
how about. how about the three of us ?
yeah , yeah .
fuck jack .
boys ! come on .
better call your husband instead .
don 't fuck around with me .
i got it . all right ? i 'm on my way . just don 't do anything , all right ?
what the hell is this ? this is the boy .
this is boy from house .
nikita , do you not understand the english that we 're speaking ?
his mother is the housekeeper . this is a mexican person .
you think jack 's gonna give a shit about this ?
hey , is it a bag of hammers or a bag of hair that you have for brains ?
it 's a mexican boy .
we gotta get the fuck outta here .
no , i got a bad feeling .
you are not going anywhere .
ok , ok , ok ! ok , ok !
i know this man . he will pay .
go on , suzie ! go get ' em !
let 's put some hands together for the monkeys !
there .
get me harry deane .
yes , he 's expecting you .
oh , i am sorry , sir .
we 'll try and get it into next month 's . deane , sit down .
i 've sent the plane to collect this woman .
interesting . oh , i see , the painting .
bloody hell . based on what ?
yes , precisely . but whose caravan , you plank ?
puznowski , deane .
welcome to london .
monet 's haystacks .
" haystacks , dawn " was traded amongst various private collectors
that is , until the nazi occupation of 1941 .
in 1945 , carinhall is overrun by the first division of patton 's army ,
your grandfather .
and what is all this to shabandar ?
i 'm trying to get ..
those people are barbarians .
how are we going to meet this woman ?
she 's surrounded by a cro-magnon swiss guard .
you boys ok , huh ?
yes , thank you . all present and correct .
nose been broke so many times , he had the cartilage taken out
would you care to wait ?
lionel shabandar explains his formula for success
shabandar media . creating ..
without wanting to overstate things , i would say it may be my favourite ...
do you ride ?
that is , i have ridden .
it was my friend bobby montaigne 's birthday party .
and how well i remember it . made a deep impression , sir .
yes , sir , there is . thank you .
i was struck most particularly by the piece on this pj puznowski ,
so , how do you find london ?
you turn right at greenland .
er , well , one of them , erm , big hotels downtown .
what are you doing ?
hello . do you have a single room ?
certainly , sir . i 'll just take a look .
we are rather hemmed in at the moment , sir .
we 'll take it .
hoss , if you 're gonna nickel-and-dime me , we can call this whole thing off .
what would my momma have said
i 'm not remotely ashamed .
sir , i already have .
bloody hell . alright , try the .. this is a mistake . try the american express .
you or the major .
there you are . that 's room 344 .
the man is not above mixing the professional with the personal
don 't make me say it . the man is ... well , he 's a cad .
und i 'm now considered as the top man on monet .
i mean , for someone from the country of germany .
und i 'm internet-savvy , but you have to be these days , don 't you think ?
ja , ja .
anyway , tell me this remarkable thing .
yep .
so , harry 's out on his butt , huh ?
he 's a bit of a disappointment , really .
i don 't know .
not that bright .
these are the moments that try men 's souls .
he 's ... no problems ?
no , he was polite enough .
these , madam , are pounds and pence , not quarters .
i bag the coins and donate the proceeds to charity .
so where do we stand with our little affair , scheme , programme ?
what ? nonsense . everything 's going according to plan .
well , then , i guess it 's just me having second thoughts , then .
don 't young lady me , hoss .
that is it .
you call the major , tell him about your second thoughts , your silly little ...
yeah , that 's part of it .
i happen to think he 's quite charming .
and look at you , trash-talkin ' my origins !
leaves me vulnerable ? i don 't know how to tell you this , harry .
oh , i 'm fired ?
very amusing .
and it is you who are fired ! except you 're not .
wrong , hoss . wrong , wrong and wrong .
i refer not just to my nose ,
don 't be an ass . i 'm hardly likely to be hit in the face a third time .
this isn 't a maths class .
yes , thank you .
the japanese ran the world in the ' 80s
so it 's kind of like a grudge match .
oh , that 's where it is . excuse me .
evening , mr deane .
right , shan 't bother you again
good evening , sir . did you find your glasses ?
not forgetting anything else , are we , sir ?
at least he 's wearing a tie .
good morning .
no , not at all . it 's just that seducing shabandar ,
you 're not lionel , and why would you wanna be ?
but you gotta quit trying to be something you 're not .
look , i understand how certain unforeseen wrinkles in my plans
pj could well have been mauled , and all to no end .
sorry , deane , it isn 't your job .
i 've got a new man . it was a bloody chore hiring him .
and there are certain things that you cannot phoney up .
i mean , this is , i have to say , really quite bloody marvellous .
either way , it 's clear that you 're of no further use to me .
it was hanging on a wall in a trailer in texas .
well , no harm done .
well , deane , against expectations ,
now , if you 'll excuse me ..
you think not what ?
i 'm afraid i can no longer render services
so did i .
find out what 's going on .
we had a deal .
based on the mediocrity of your performance
apparently michael 's a little more headstrong than either of us imagined .
we have a lead on him somewhere in central arizona .
if you speak to michael ,
2,500 miles to go .
should we call lincoln ? let him know we 're coming ?
and for what it 's worth , i might 've done the same thing .
actually , it 's not .
i don 't believe that 's true .
you 're saying my mom 's in miami ?
she 's a company agent .
linc ..
oh , no .
it 's actually a birdhouse kit .
i didn 't talk to her for two days after that ,
goodness .
as soon as you see that ..
you 'll never get that open .
can you open the side door ?
sara .
i don 't think we 're going to be able to move this .
christina ?
there are people out looking for us .
just a little while longer , only a few more days .
i understand what you think your role is in all of this ,
oh , look .
jonathan .
it 's good to hear your voice .
mr. burrows .
you haven 't changed a bit .
i know it wasn 't the most straightforward
i 'm sure you have many questions .
suffice it to say . i couldn 't protect you then ,
once he is dealt with ,
i need two days
.. then i can give you and michael
i 'm going to get started right away .
and for that reason ,
once we pull this box down ,
what is your move ?
there they go , come on .
we 're investigating a cruelty to animal charge .
worse than the place down the street we shut down .
sit down .
but we 're not going to know that until we take a look around .
that is our sanctuary .
i understand your concerns , but i need to go back there .
best i can do is have you accompany us , please .
till they were on their way home
things had gotten so bad ,
you 're unbelievable ! you 're so cheap .
i 'm not buying you a new car .
it isn 't even a holiday .
you beat cancer , i 'll buy you a car .
what ?
what ? ! no ! you piece of crap !
and that is how the unhappy marriage ,
by the name of wisteria lane .
brought out their candy canes ..
of course ,
that 's funny . did you hear that ?
okay . how about some christmas music ?
do we really want the kid working with electricity ?
you 're clumping .
i don 't want to get into it .
this is the time we should come together
hey what 's going on ?
oh , my god . i was just there five minutes ago .
well , she was really upset .
but you definitely said your name was tyler .
my name 's danny .
um , can i see my mom ?
i 'm sorry . not while you 're under observation .
but we still need your insurance information , mr . bolen .
like us not being able to see our kid ?
what do you mean ?
i mean ... you never talk about your past .
having no insurance , wanting to pay cash for everything ,
you 're in the witness protection program , aren 't you ?
how 'd you figure it out ?
once i noticed you were italian , i just kinda went from there .
none taken .
i suppose the fact that you did believe me ,
for what it 's worth ,
here 's katherine 's room .
really ?
it doesn 't make any sense .
well , if you must know
even though i am so angry with him ,
so how did it go ?
i can 't tell if she 's crazy or just devious
only a family member
it 'll be okay .
so we 'll run out right before the babies are born .
ah , like food , clothing , sober mother ?
for what ?
you have to drop out of school .
i have really , really screwed this up .
yeah . won 't that be great ?
maybe it 's your turn .
whatever it is , i can explain .
love , karl . "
i don 't care . you can 't put a price on love .
$ 20 gift certificate to a rib joint .
so the gift was for both of us .
i hope this bree says yes ..
for what it 's worth , i 'm a divorce lawyer .
jeff , look at the mess in here !
our therapist said we need to do more stuff together .
would it kill you to spend some time with the woman you love ?
as long as she doesn 't deflate in the plane .
you know why ? because you are awful .
okay ,
and you have every right to go to hell .
i do . i care about my friends .
i 'm in .
we can 't just let some stupid housewife
we gotta try to make this go away .
i just thought i 'd come by
what 's the big deal ?
orson doesn 't know .
if 's not funny . karl .
yeah , about that ..
don 't you dare give me a present
mm , i 'm sticking with " no . "
i just heard it , too .
but i did sell one to kobe bryant .
and i have a very funny story , actually .
that 's hilarious .
okay , um ... oh !
it is in my court .
come on . let me see ' em .
gil pickles .
so much better than my phil-low cases .
one of him in bed is more than enough .
all right . just hit " send . "
give her a round of applause , everybody .
i wanna thank you kids for having me here today .
but i will tell him what you said .
you know , your little meltdown in there got me thinking .
are you offering me a job ?
and for the safety of you and your family ,
that went on for a while .
i can 't be the only one who gets hungry in there !
that 's fantastic .
i think claire 's going through some pretty dark stuff ,
what do you mean ?
let 's go .
you want to go to the park and get ice cream or what ?
you look hungry .
no girls like her at school . she is distant and basically ,
so why did you give me your card ?
i left my home about a year or so ago .
i was drinking my ass off standing on a subway platform
oh , no , it 's real
there are two sets of keys on the table in there .
you 're due at the label later this afternoon
ow sweet is this girl ? i ove that .
how great are these guys ? i love them .
yeah , thank you so much
il 's the back i like
this is the actual size of my penis . "
want to hear it ?
would you be interested in that ?
it just happened . i .
i just .... i have to see it through .
obviously ...
i don 't remember if you take sugar or ..
hey , you should come and sing on a track .
it 's gonna be simple . you should come play .
uh , it just proves that a guy from nowhere can actually make it
uh , gosh , thank you .
fuck off !
i 'm in the fucking zone .
i 'm gonna write a song .
what is " this " ?
however , um , dr. webber has offered to take over .
i 'll take blake .
i 'm chief of general . it 's the job .
of course . i 'll do it .
oh , no , i 'm not parking . i 'm just stopping for a sec .
yeah , yeah , i got a patient . no worries .
obviously . i ... i skipped that .
we 're a level i trauma center .
blake , get him ready for transport .
it 's not enough to have her here in the same building .
i am trying to rise above .
no , you should have ended it that night .
it was better when we weren 't talking .
both sides .
all right , he doesn 't have the time
why 'd you even bring him to me ?
you knew this was hopeless .
i don 't know why you are .
dr. grey , dr. blake .
thank you , sir . it 's been ...
great . how 's she doing ? not too well .
what did you miss ?
what did i do that you missed ?
you would 've killed the patient , blake .
it 's that simple .
what 's wrong ?
i 'm new .
if she cracks under the pressure of an emergent surgery ,
her references were impeccable . i checked them myself .
so you knew where she was from ?
her losses ?
she was an excellent candidate .
and you didn 't find that reason enough ?
that 's good news .
got an e-mail from our bishop .
he is young , so ..
we could wire them with rib grafts .
that was one reason .
when you were accepted to this program ,
and you walked in ,
here. every day .
i decided to put aside my personal feelings to ...
and i 'm glad i did that .
he would have said the same thing .
not for long , i imagine .
i was , most of the time .
we 'll never let as an empty handed .
look at the brooch .
this is a special kind of bird .
enough to pay for all our heads ?
jorund ! take your hands away !
aye-aye ..
we were attacked by vikings .
no , my king .
they 're at least dozen of them .
but , my king
it was served a lesson to your officers have subjects
we know everything we need to know .
otherwise , they would not climb of the cliff .
you need not look twice to see she is working them
and i will award you , handsomely .
my father is dead .
so either you continues with this
do not do it again .
you cannot kill me . dead i am not worthless to you .
your family will still pay full prize .
since this is obviously not your land
you might find shelter this way .
you do not have to .
and get the fire start in .
they locked by the audrin tower .
but we were defeated
but they were in strange .
give me your word ..
why do you care ?
from the fury of the northmen , release us .
we shall meet there , my friend
take as many weapons as you can carry .
follow me .
clever .
we have to know who our enemies are .
jorund , are you really that stupid ?
but any his enemies certainly will .
the king dunchaid still has a fortifications .
not even your great army was able too .
with boats , as in painting .
who is say not led us into a trap ?
i say we have no other option but to accept his help .
he is a christian , you should think again .
if he wanted us dead , we has opportunity enough .
the peaks are useful for climbing and hunting
and it is there that the basques are in openings in the cliff .
and the openings will be flooded in to springs .
one moment . what 's in it for you , monk ?
one day , i was ordered to the
but not only was able to win their trust .
without bloodshed .
you mean , men like you ?
after all the defeats , he fled with us .
just like you .
do not worry , my heart is not broken .
this explains why you locked in the wagon .
take the shirt off , or i 'll cut it off .
that does it for you ? all right .
f 'aster . come on .
no , no , no . back down .
youl 're adorable .
dude !
why would you post that ?
val , i didn 't know you were so much fun .
okay , seriously , i 'm friends with my mom on here .
come on !
he 's been listening this whole time .
yeah , me neither .
let 's just hang up .
come over , adam , and we ' go see , uh ..
just play the stupid game .
what the fuck are you doing ?
it 's just three words . free live cams .
having beautiful women all over the internet
yes ! somewhere horrible ! somewhere corrupt !
unhappy , darling ?
oh , gomez , you have torn down my walls
so i missed one practice . what 's the big deal ?
the sabre mazurka is the most important day
it 's the day your entire family gathers around you
but swords are so old-fashioned .
son , our family hasn 't been all together in 13 years .
i just want it to go perfectly .
that 's my boy .
no ! no !
if i 'd known you were coming ,
you won 't even know i 'm here .
uncle ,
i heard a strange noise in the fog earlier ,
it has notes of oak , cherry , and yoga .
ah ! let me try that .
they have a wonderful grit !
this is where we all belong , yeah
it 's easy to be happy when you have no choice
well , then , we ought to do the same .
say it again until you believe it
gomez , we should return home .
true , these people are a little different .
we have to give them a chance . get to know them .
" win them over " ?
margaux needler .
my wife , morticia .
our children , wednesday , pugsley .
you know , we can see right into your windows ?
as your neighbor , i 'd like to offer you
it will be a challenge ,
i should like to see what this plastic woman has to offer .
actually , ms. needler ..
stop by anytime you 'd like .
i 'll see you at your house , first thing tomorrow .
that woman seems deranged .
yeah , that 's fine . i mean , no one would know .
okay , right by the printer .
i think this guy paralyzed his own kid
i got this . why don 't you go be with your dad ?
what ? you must have questions .
help me get him to the o.r. ,
he has a lot of internal bleeding ,
oh , my god .
he was moving .
so sit tight .
nope ! no .
like a train wreck .
um , what are you doing here ?
now is that a farm tradition ?
all right . i totally understand if you 're not .
that is none of your business !
he 's just hooking up with the best teacher
congratulations .
and you became the thing we laughed at .
i 'm sorry . i
you did your best , and ..
thanks .
we 're not family .
i paged you to get yang . yang is his doctor .
besides , i treated him .
i know what i 'm doing .
all this blood . where is it ? where is it ?
got it . i got my finger on it .
no . the perf 's widening already .
2-0 silk .
the issue of ..
you will not be king .
you will not inherit this crown .
that privilege and responsibility
but it is my duty as king ,
when do you fight ?
we fight by week 's end .
these feuds need not be yours .
a bird ? a dead one , i should suppose .
unnatural mechanics from the edge of christendom .
this belongs to my cousin , cambridge .
indeed i have known you longer than i have my own young sister .
so , i think it only fitting that you should have this magical bird .
from the dauphin ,
there is no accompanying message from the dauphin ?
i shall keep this gift .
for the boy i once was .
you must respond .
a new chapter of my life has begun before the last could be properly closed .
but the fact that this here be the first occasion
to steer our present course ,
i need men around me i can trust .
a king has no friends .
i 'm sorry my occasion to visit ...
the second ...
what did you say to me ?
how dare you defy me ?
don 't let it outside this tent .
and where is the fearsome old warrior falstaff
i speak only when there 's something to be said .
i 'm not that man .
my liege .
sires . what can i do for you ?
we are both outnumbered and out-positioned .
that should be a tip in your inspirational book ,
the other really important thing i did today ...
now you can give one to peach
yeah , a connection to her babies ' asses .
plus , peach is interviewing this gay guy
just give her the cards . we have to start somewhere .
that 's pretty cool .
it 's real .
don 't say your real thoughts .
use my spa voice ? okay .
i want you to make sure the twins
all they drink is breast milk .
we 're all so tense about the birthday party .
um , peach , um ...
i don 't need it . like , i 'm fine .
like a ... like a ... favor .
i 'm sorry .
i have to go meet the martha stewart queen
well , that 's exactly how i envisioned that .
a rat with a civil war hat .
i did my part , so you better get this bed done .
i 'm so proud of you . what did she say ?
relax . the bed will be assembled
you called a guy ?
wait . you don 't know any guys .
johnny .
eh , i don 't want to see johnny .
i thought you guys were friends .
he was fake interviewing me with a celery stalk ...
yeah , it 's hard for my people , too ,
but they did keep you warm , i bet ,
that 's southern belle .
no , i 'm still thinking about my balls .
that was weird , right ?
intense good or intense bad ?
whoo .
no , this is where i go to my already-built bed .
whatever that was out there with my boob ,
go in !
what is happening out here ?
was that of feeling rich .
this should have alerted us .
there were hints all along ,
we were traveling light .
i was younger .
but the actions that we have been forced to take in that area ,
just the simple fact that she 's down there reporting on the conflict
mr. secretary , if i may disagree .
but he , and i , can assure you , as his chief foreign aid officer ,
obviously , we don 't want to compromise decision-making on our part
look , berquist , please assure the senator that we 're working very hard
fine . that 's all .
mr. secretary , uh ...
mike 's paying .
beautiful day for some flag
who doesn 't love cheerleaders and hank williams ?
sorry ?
different animal entirely .
well , when you put it like that ...
not every bull can be a longhorn , am i right ?
don 't know .
i got the pictures cold . why the national guard ?
that 's the stuff you 're looking at .
none of it 's staying put , though .
no , don 't do that . don 't mention it .
okay ?
it 's a pager .
you could need a lot of things , but let 's not worry about that .
what does that look like ?
okay ? don 't drive yourself , you take a cab .
you understand ?
you be on time .
can we hurry this up ?
sixty-foot kill zone .
look , take it easy , mcmahon , okay ?

yeah .
i thought i could show a girl a few tricks
ah , let 's just say the only wand
i like the fabric .
well , she cut up one of her old bathing suits .
has she tried on the vest yet ? !
this is good practice . i mean ,
i haven 't seen this trick in years .
you let everyone see the pan is empty .

my apologies . how can i help you today ?
great , trouble with girlfriends

a timber camp ?
unfortunately , it burned down and killed her whole family .

our love is more important than that child , isn 't it ?
you just tell me where galloway is .
those assholes give you homework now ?
they got something that they want me to do .
how do you know about the picnic ?
i 'm not talking to you .
come on .
before we break up here , i wanna go over

or a cruise ship .
i 'll set my head on fire before i conga .

cool , it 's a plan . see ya .

or just meet there , then ?
the best spectacle in the world .
i said i might meet him over there .
tonight 's karaoke .
well , just call him and tell him you can 't make it .
t ' walt until the office closes
there 's no shame in it . ia 's instinct .
you see what i mean ?
what about the body ?
yours , jerry .
but even though there were bad moments .
very bad .
you totally stopped taking the pills , didn 't you ?
thanks for your honesty , jerry .
i 'm just gonna go to the bathroom .
okay , i 'll be right back .
i 'll .. i 'll stop them .
they already know . i told them .
i told them that sometimes i can hear
the angels talking to me .
i know you do , jerry .
i told them and they won 't let me alone .
promise .
i 'm really glad you asked me out .
you 're so mysterious , you know .
hmm .
what 's on your mind ?
definitely .
i know . i gotta go home and feed my cat and dog
no , it 's okay .
just pretend you 're delivering something .
i 'll try .
bye . bye .
i want to smell her crotch , jer .
where the fuck 's my food , fuck face ?
i wanna bring him a gift or something

and that tiny sonya thomas always wins .
or am i interrupting ?
yeah ... i ... it 's just that what you heard is , um ..
a lot of the time .
our father , who art in heaven , hallowed be thy name ,
amen
i can 't reach her , either .
no email , no facebook updates .
i liked all of them and i wish they were all alive .
do you have packing tape ?
because i can 't let you go and i still need a lot of therapy .
back ! back !
let 's discuss this
oh , a lot of people hear voices .
a lot of people ?
it might be a voice telling them
drink that drink , take that drug ,
not exactly the same as you ,
but none of chat 's true .
well , i can 't shut them off entirely ...
but i can argue against them .
hey .
it 's not your fault
put me the fuck down , you goddamn psycho .
the suspect 's car is in the parking lot .
i want you two on the right .
all right , keep low , guys .
is this your brilliant escape plan , jerry ?
it 's your favorite door , isn 't it ?
so because of my husband 's disability ,
i can 't believe it 's still available .
this time , use a little elbow grease .
enough for my taste .
oh , it sounds like he 's leaving .
maybe i should go apologize .
ida 's cat got out again .
i hope you find him .
wait . hold on . i have to fix this .
oh , she was calm .
no you 're missing my point .
my kid than there are for yours .
poogirl has been through .
her mom was kind of a psycho .
i am just saving , apple ... tree .
and i 'm just saying , my daughter is fine .
orson , what are you doing here ?
the key is the sleepwalking .
i was sleepwalking when i drove the car .
i saw you take money from one of ' em .
all right .
i do tattoos .
hers are for grown-ups and they sell .
what 's this about ?
america with a law degree ,
we have our problems like anyone else .
you guys live one day at a time ?
so fragile right now ,
i get it . you did that once before .
wasn 't it , though ?
i made that play for your cousin .
anyway , i lied about every bit of it .
i know .
this , but , uh ... he 's a good guy .
which cousin ?
where is she ? !
she only uses the place in the winter , so ..
and that 's deb .
uh , no , just medical school .
god , good for her .
sand , sun , cheesy matching outfits .
whom you 're interrogating right now , right ?
lincoln , the point of this action
aren 't you leaving something out ,
let 's talk about thinking too much , okay ?
yesterday he found us on interstate 10 .
and " ms " are your initials .
he 's been here three days
well , and from what i 've gathered ,
bengali has 14 different vowels .
lincoln got away .
i have .
do you have anything ?
i 'm sorry , michael .
so , the guy who was posing as a cop
and if he was following
at least she didn 't want us killed .
hark , what was that ? one more time ?
we need to move now .
self ready to go , t-bag ?
just run your mouth .
look , when we get in , we 'll let you know .
i don 't know about that .
excuse me ?
uh .. could you notify him i 'm here ? thank you .
she lives in kashmir .
that explains a lot , don 't it ? listen ,
naturally ,
this is all very sudden .
i will just say one more thing ...
what do you think your father
and don 't worry about sandinsky .
move an inch
you honor your side of the agreement
i need your beijing report for the foreign office .
yeah , on it .
" that means a qrc surge effort to revive / create efforts
are the yanks really asking us to dig up
" this effort will probably peak in the middle of next week
excuse me . question .
uh , this nsa memo , our people approved it ?
the americans want us to help
it 's a joint uk / usa operation .
what is the status , in your view , of any second resolution ?
just let me reiterate what i just said .
any attempt to drag the process on for months
no , no , this is important .
come on , there are no credible links
i don 't know , a journalist ,
at least my conscience is clear .
we have a right to intervene in the balkans .
iraq 's a little more complicated .
oh , fuck sonny and cher !
milosevic bad . saddam bad .
and yet colin powell presented
really ?
whose product is he then ?
so why don 't you tell your journalists
okay , what if i had evidence that the nsa
you tell me .
you know , martin , i believe that all information
but in this case , i don 't have the luxury of time , admiral .
yes , i see .
... not on whether a news report
ed , it 's edie from the london office .
he said you should call extension 6727 .
6727 . good luck .
what am i supposed to do ?
if you say nothing , they can never prove anything .
they 're interrogating my friends .
that will be over soon .
there will be a question mark
i have to prove it was real .
nobody cares !
if i don 't say it was me , then we 'll go to war
clive ponting
so since ' 89 , the public interest is
i have to think about it .
i promised anne a weekend away .
but she 's young and principled .
you sure he was following you ?
sometimes men stare ...
what kind of a stare was it ?
i work at gchq .
you 've never seen war ! you 've never smelled it !
you should see if they 're looking for extras .
l can 't have a beer now ?
addy , you want to try it ?
and i sure as hell am not doing it , so .
oh , okay . good .
howard 's gonna stop by , we 're gonna play
i prefer the classics : regular and klingon .
just fyi ,
you went out in the hallway .
if it 'll make you feel better , we rarely listen .
yeah , sure .
so you 're probably wondering what that was all about .
nah , women do that to me all the time .
what ? why ?
you 're a scientist who went to college
just guys .
why can 't you get back together with leonard ?
really ?
so , leonard , i 'm taking your gal out
right , leonard ?
but i 'm gonna blow that off to spend the evening
what kind of spaceship has a hole in the middle ?
knock-knock .
come on in .
so where 's the telescope ?
he 's hoping to see epsilon eridani dim , which would be
i did it with you when we rented the note book .
you 'd better open up that bottle of wine
i can 't be drinking , i 'm about to make
how do you know that ?
maybe i could go in a little late .
your career is far too important .
bernadette , please tell your boyfriend
once he finds a joke he likes , he sticks with it .
like his haircut material .
" no . i got them all cut . "
right . " help , i 'm a prisoner
" howard , come rub my feet !
i bring this up , because , in 140 years ,
he is still afraid ,
i would encourage everyone who is watching ,
i thought i thought this out .
the key is they 're back there ,
yeah , especially since we don 't have a pot to piss in
you 're not being very transparent , warden .
maybe you should ,
right now . mr. mahone ,
either she fights and lives , or she quits and dies .
do whatever thing you got to do , man .
you don 't care that someone 's going to be executed for your murder
who did ? your sister , the president ?
i 'm a prisoner to all of this .
you could have come forward .
everything we need .
storage .
he brought the entire thing in ,
i knew the guy was an engineer or whatever ,
uh , he was cool you know .
everything had to be perfect ,
we have your number right ?
i see that you have a mrs. gudat out there .
fine .
story of my life .
do i really look that stupid ?
it 's all here isn 't it ?
ripe chance woods .
got someone looking into it .
captain , manager says
oh , jeez ...
come on , kate ! i 'm waiting !
he shoved me against the wall , into this picture .
i want for the two of you to get along .
teddy , please put the tree back up .
come on , you guys ! dad would 've had this place looking ...
this does not look like a christmas tree . it looks like ...
whoa , whoa ! you want some cookie with those sprinkles ?
dad likes sprinkles .
sometimes i forget .
she 's our friend and she 's crazy !
no , no , no , no . teddy , teddy , i don 't think this is such a good idea .
oh , come on ! do you wanna save christmas ?
uh , that kinda undermines the whole naughty or nice concept , don 't you think ?
i mean , technically , that 's illegal , too .
and , plus , it 's not just any car .
i mean , we 're not even breaking the law because ..
i mean , i 'm used to something with more pop under the hood ,
i 'm santa claus , teddy , not yoda .
what he does . i ...
lowell .
let me get this straight . you broke into this boy 's residence
santa !
i know , i know .
now we 're gonna see what you 're made of !
and go !
some things we gotta figure out on our own , teddy .
all right , here 's the book with all the names and addresses .
ignore him ,
you know , when they told him he won ,
who listens to the radio anymore ?
they say it could be a potential indicator
isn 't he an indicator of life on other planets ?
now everything is bert , bert , bert !
you want me to read a geology paper ?
you busy ?
who is it ?
i found him in an old box .
i didn 't buy it .
last question .
what 's the big deal ?
no , it 's not . check it out .
hey good lookin ' .
his eyes also light up in the dark .
no , i went to punch the water fountain ,
if 's not hard . just picture the three stooges ,
jealousy is completely illogical .
everyone gets jealous .
what about me and sheldon ?
i 've always been jealous of how much money
i 've been envious of her looks .
i thought it was brave .
you know , how come nobody 's talking about
and i think you 're cute .
i think i hate all of you nerds .
oh , i don 't mind .
well , change " plaque " to " mixed-race couple "
bert . bert . bert !
all right , let 's do this ..
we need to talk .
rock , rock , water fountain .
but i have been envious of your recent success .
once i get lasik , i 'll be out of things to wish for .
hey , boss lady ,
yeah , i went there !
well , if he 's handling han 's hose ,
i 'll show you what this puppy can do .
a little help .
damn ! that 's hot .
well , i better go dry off in the men 's room .
i 've got a date with the land o 'lakes butter package lady
max ? are you seeing what i 'm seeing ?
we might not be able to get nash fired ,
he could be the future bulge of calvin klein .
why can 't you just accept that we are stuck
not me , ' cause i 'm past that .
i think i just sat another one of those
why do you think i got out of pimping ?
so , did you get nash a modeling job yet ?
it 's not like i can just call tyra banks .
ugh , phone therapy ran long .
are my dates here yet ?
it 's her , her , and her .
i have a movie that starts shooting tomorrow
it 's the lead in sorest rump .
should i come with you ?
i have a couple of questions for the actor .
max , this has gone too far .
also , what does " gay for pay " mean ?
look at him , max .
nash doesn 't care about modeling .
his biggest concern is playing with the xbox .
he cares about you .

i 'm meeting someone here and my phone 's about to die .
do you have an outlet ?
like , right into the water .
i 'll plug you in , honey .

you know how much i love lady tail .
isn 't it amazing ?
you can feel his anger in the walls .
i mean , it 's not only me . nobody can stand her .
okay , well , on that note ...
and then they learn to talk .
oh , you .
i guess that 's a " no " on phyllis ?
why not ?
they didn 't lose their daughter , mia .
by now she 's probably got three husbands and calls herself " star . "
no . why would t ?
they call themselves " the family . "
the two are believed to be members of a cult
one officer summed up these blood-soaked murders by saying
which is why ...
f you do so delicately .
yes , sir . thank you .
you 're on bed rest for a while . you 'd go crazy if i didn 't .
you know i can 't stand them .
okay ? we can turn the whole room into your own little sweatshop .
you think the baby 's okay ?
oh , really ? because i heard there 's some new research that , um , you know ..
i love you .
i realize , miss prentice , but you still have time . mind if i look around ?
i do know how painful this must be for you .
look , i don 't even want to talk about it . i don 't wanna think about it . i ...
what if they 're not dead ? what 'll you do then ?
help me !
excuse me .
may be leah will like it too , when she 's a little older .
well , feel free to stop by anytime .
hey .
see ! tha ' s us .
so we turned to the church , tather .
and it worked for them .
but you two hit more than just a rough patch .
and it made them see and do all sorts of
have you ever heard the expression :
and one more thing . does the cult have a name ?
is there anything i can help you with ?
i just learned something
and if it does , i 'm too tired to show it .
or we just .. i think my family 's being haunted by a ghost .
how do we stop it from coming back ?
but someone at the church might .
what do we do in the meantime ?
jet me take her .
it will weaken the demon enough , it won 't have the strength to return .
of course .
oh , no . no , john . i can 't . not until i know it 's not coming back .
what if i just stayed up with her ?
okay .
john .
heh . you are going to spoil her .
oh , i don 't know if that is true .
oh , evelyn .
oh , mommy .
put her down here .
what was it that you were humming ?
it was the only thing that would settle my ruby down when she was a baby .
if you don 't wanna talk about it , it 's fine .
they live up north .
family will do that to you .
last thing i remember was .
i woke up three weeks later ...
i didn 't get a chance to say goodbye .
i made the mistake .

joey , did you see that shit ?
shut up , joey
where are you guys going ?
it is a tie game

i am a cop .
we 've been getting a lot of calls about stolen cop cars .
sorry , sergeant , we should have called it in first .

just to be clear ...
what was that ?
you know what , then make him afraid of you .

i 'm highly capable of being by myself .
so what do you wanna do ?

you have a keen insight into the human heart ,
i just ..
you didn 't know it was me and you were hitting on me ?
i pretty much thought you were , you know , just some blonde .

well , i 'm not gonna tell him , and neither are you .
she gets chilled easily .
well , i can see why she comes in every week .
when she first started coming in , before they met ,
she was adventurous ...
when she 'd gone through the menu ,
she became ... my favorite part of the week .
she felt like this was a safe place for a first date .
the night he proposed to her ..
the sloan nose .
he 's been staring at her from his kitchen for 15 years .
he just did . she was awake the whole time .
and they look like they 're smart .
they expected nothing from me .. ever .

doc robbins found rope fibers in the victim 's teeth .
so he wasn 't trying to loosen his restraints

i will repeat this message in spanish .

we are on our way to quince 's villa right now .
i 'm sorry , i wasn 't prepared for you to actually answer that .
you meet us at the villa , we will reveal the killer .
which , en francais , roughly translates to leboutillier .
this is a joke .
fine ! then tobey killed him , but he did it with a little help .
you convinced tobey to kill malcolm so you could split the money with him .
then me and this girl started asking too many questions .
luckily , not for him , but sergei gets in the way .
i don 't care what happens to me anymore , okay ?
i just wanted to take one of them down with me .
he 's also being arraigned for the murder of his mother and his stepfather .
exactly .
right now , his only shot is if we can get him tried as a minor .
i need to sell to the court that he was just a scared kid .
'he 'll listen to me . i need to see him .
he gets tried as an adult , he may as well sit in my lap in the chair .
i can still do my job .

when i play cards , it ain 't gambling .
so why are you just bringing this up now ?
go get our money , boy .
oh , hell , no .
look , all you need to know is this ,

we 've got a lot of customers . you may want to go wash up .
joteph , go and hose down my crocs .

those boys had their eyes open .
we made them have their eyes open .

so , the night went well ?
to be by his side , to think about our books and what we 've accomplished with them .
passing the torch .
yeah , i married his son neil . we had one daughter , meg .
and you remained close to the thrombeys .
i feel simultaneously freed by
sorry , the nugget of .. : ?
did he get " into it " at the party ?
come one , dad !
i didn 't hear what he said , but he must 've really handed him his lunch .
you 're just dumping that bag of weak sauce on it .
all three of them did .
walter .
harlan had turned walter down before regarding film rights .
now , we look at the pattern . harlan was cleaning house .
did he plan to fire walter ?
yeah , please just wait inside , stay close , all right ?
and yes . you are right .
oh my god !
this is what i just gave you a 100 milligrams of .
you gave me a 100 milligrams of the good stuff ?

hugh drysdale ?

we just wanna ask a few questions .
we 're officers of the law .
hey benny , you wanna ask this guy some questions ?
mr. drysdale .
hey frannie , how about a glass of cold milk ?
and i know that 's what grandfather was trying to protect me from by doing this ,
after i left the party , though , i was driving
like from here on out i was gonna have to fend for myself .
good .
marta i know three things . one : i know he didn 't commit suicide .
i don 't think it . i know it .
and he wanted it for you .
what 's going on ? this isn 't you .
because fuck my family .
you 're gonna give me my cut of the inheritance .
yeah .
meg .
marta get your ass up , what the hell is happening ? there 's a guy here and a bunch of stuff .
maybe , alice , i don 't know .
we don 't know much about marta cabrera or her exact relationship ...
i haven 't checked my email .
that 's it . 1209 columbus road , 10 am .
if you destroy that copy you are totally in the clear .
marta , did you hear me ?
elliott ! we gotta go ! we gotta go !
oh god ! you regret helping me yet ?
anyway this will tie everything up .
god , you 're not much of a detective , are you ?
you make a pretty lousy murderer .
you 've always been good to me .
but i thought after what you 've gone through the last few days ,
excuse me !
you have all treated her like shit to steal back a fortune
nose all beak 's bloody .
ms. cabrera has decided definitively not to renounce the inheritance .
furthermore , it will be my professional recommendation to the local authorities
indulge me .
yes , you did . yes , he did . yes , you are , but . but .
and what you and harlan did that fateful night seems at first glance
but we must look a little closer .
it is not a donut hole , but a smaller donut with its own hole ,
why was i hired ? why would someone hire me ?
i was hired before the sealed will was read .
you can 't be serious !
marta , remind me what ransom said his conversation with harlan ended with .
well , voila !
so , why did she send it to me ?
and when mr. drysdale gets it , what is his reaction ?
and then ...
and everything turns on its head .
the changed will is gonna stand . he has lost .
unless you decide .
it doesn ' count
this is another bird and food trapping resource .
that 's an application for hummingbird trap .
two tier explosion .
a second bomb .
second one goes off here .
i don 't think some of them use any rule book when we hijacked feeta .
she maybe be able to sway some of the loyalists .
this isn 't like the rest of panem
we need to control the arsenal inside that fortress .
that 's the same facile thinking that led you to divert
if the mockingiay was gone ,
i 'm afraid that is not what we were toasting at all .
i mean , it 's everybody 's job to keep you alive .
partly .
the whole tacky romance drama and the defender-of-the-helpless act .
which makes you even more unbearable .
you should have been the mockingjay nobody has to tell you what to say .
you 're free
the last the rebels saw me i was lying on the ground .
we will shoot more propos right here in 13 .
i should be with the troops .
as far as the soldiers know you survived a bullet to the heart .
when we win this war we 'll fly you in for the surrender .
i 'll do whatever you need me to do .
put her in the rotation .
especially with all this going on.it 's going to set him off .
why would coin do this ?
they promised a free election .
nobody would think that i 'd be a leader .
if your immediate answer isn 't yes then you are dangerous .
only one thing you could do now to add more fire to this rebellion .
we 've been here before , you know ?
that look
i never wanted to kill you .
i saw with my own eyes .
after that , i saw you ...
hey , we better move .
those surveillance cameras caught us .
this is a bad spot . we need to move , now .
i can 't get a signal .
bog2s gave it to me .
he did .
i saw him .
i 'm on special orders from coin .
let 's not lose our heads here
was she valuable ? she was extremely valuable to your rebellion .
you call themselves an alliance ,
yeah , that doesn 't even show the new ones .
and the red tops suggest to that .
my brother knows these tunnels really well .
they changed them .
like the .. little ones that they changed , they have this .
you should get some rest .
they mean that our lives were never ours .
cur lives , belong to snow and our deaths do too .
if you end all of this ...
salla .
she can 't lose you .
the way she kissed you in the quarter quell .
no , you won her over .
it 's not going to be an issue much longer .
and if we do , then ...
yeah
sun 's coming up .
i have an announcement .
interim ?
we have no way of knowing for certain .
we 'll plan an election when the time is right .
a symbolic vote .
hundreds of his accomplices also await their deaths .
i know you 'll never escape it .
we 're in that sweet period where everyone agrees
although who knows ? maybe this time we 'll learn .
it 's better for you to be out of sight .
and i hope you can find yours.plutarch .
home . we go home .
it 's your job to take care of yourself now , katniss .
i kinda need you to care .
most important of all ? we reproduce .
it 's the opposite , actually .
and that 's interesting ,
space , dr . bailey . we don 't have enough space .
we need money . bailey .
it 's my turn to have cristina yang on my service .
hostile uterus .
at least it 's not cancer .
uh , as long as they like . why ?
april 's best friend just died , and she 's all alone .
okay ? i find her annoying .
car ran into a laundromat . multiple traumas !
it 's about a chore wheel .
that 's a great idea .
hey , the vending machine 's working again .
nothing .
i was at the dentist this morning . i have bad teeth .
i went to the o.b. today .
so there 's a chance the cancer could come back ?
but if we do this , if you agree ,
uh , it 's only been done a few times in the world .
we hope .
god knows , i love to watch you dance , but ..
boobs , really ?
he stares at them .
can i leave now ?
so we had to remove his spleen and a kidney ,
uh , she 's out of surgery now . she 's doing great .
and as for your tests ,
he 's not my husband anymore .
larry left me three months ago .
a week later , i find out he 's living with someone else .
people must tell you their secrets all the time
no , no .
no , ma am .
well , it doesn 't help that it 's halloween .
ladies !
oh ! and do me a favor .
okay , we gotta talk .
hey , sweetie . how was your dad 's ?
good .
i 'm gonna be a swan .
you don 't have to make it . jane said she would .
well , i should go thank her for helping me to parent you .
or maybe you should .
oh , stop . you look great .
briefly . i was young and needed money .
see you monday .
that 's what this is .
no , no , no , no .
what is going on ?
didn 't you once staple math tests
so i , of course , said i would .
well , you 're in luck .
and he 'll make my kid 's cat outfit ?
because he 's got a lot on his plate right now .
he 's been drinking a lot .
no . no . he 's been going to a.a. meetings .
i certainly understand what he 's going through .
don 't move . there 's one by your foot .
so ... you wanna play some video games ?
okay . um ...
only 36 hours to go .
i am the candy-bot 3000 .
oh , come on . your son is dying to go trick-or-treating .
until i deliver these paintings ,
don 't look at this . it 's not done .
your hands are gonna slide right off the wheel .
i can still feel those slimy things
unless ..
there 's no body to be found .
dad and jane will be here soon .
all i 'm doing is counting the minutes
they had giant peanut butter cups .
i got a chocolate bomb . you want some ?
but we 've only done half the street .
tough .
or a painting you just walk past
okay , just keep going . this is really making the time fly by .
whoa ! is it , uh ...
uh ... don 't think so .
maybe i should , uh , take off a layer .
i 'm not sure . i 've got this ...
yeah , and your eyes look a little glassy .
we can do this another night , you know .
now ... get over here , big man .
this was under the mat .
had me stumped for a good four seconds .
can we go trade candy ?
andre .
all right . yeah .
but i was thinking about what you said .
god . is that how things work in your world ?
i 've learned to live with that mainly by not caring .
i swear to god i don 't .
my work is always gonna come first .
that 's what i was getting to . i heard what you said .
you may not have a choice .
that 's weird . they didn 't even wait for the candy .
i was asleep . you know .
around 2.30 .
sure .
we can go right now .
in case she calls .
in my opinion , the trial will be a formality .
dr. hamel ?
not asking questions and keeping your trap shut
this is a small town here . mister ..
how long can i think it over ?
didn 't you want to kill him ?
but i knew it was pointless .
in prison , where he belongs .
how is the doctor 's wife . mrs. svlvie berube .
jean fafard spoke with her .
you don 't approve of his actions ?
i think that his grief has driven him mad .
mrs. berube ?
what made you tell the press i 've gone crazy ?
he was calling from st. julie .
anyone would lose it if a loved one was murdered .
give me a second .
roll medical ! stat !
i 'll ride back with the victim .
well , my work is done here .
all right .
what do you got down there ?
the guy 's on fire , he rolls ,
yeah .
think he was tossed from a moving vehicle ?
that 's more than enough juice to stop a man 's heart .
so either my theory 's wrong
i analyzed the black
i wouldn 't steer you wrong , bud .
she smells like fresh peaches .
yeah , you know , like peaches .
yeah , nice . so you didn 't , uh ...
don 't tell me . i don 't want to know .
storage facility over there .
yeah , all right .
you sure you want to do that ?
so we 've got two victims ,
but our first guy . carlton doreen , didn 't die .
i doubt it .
really ?
well , if your intent is just to kill ,
both the victims ' skin and clothing
elijah newbloom 's t.o.d. was
so i caught this truck on the move at 2 : 30 a.m .
truck belongs to one johannes desmoot .
excuse me .
hi , greg .
oh , you know ...
oh , don 't worry , i completely understand .
yeah .
rain , sun , sleet or hail .

so , uh ..
yep . he used to work as an interrogator
where 's your truck , johannes ?
get out of there . she 's trouble .
she is a teacher .
i called her .
i wanted an explanation .
she couldn 't make it on a schoolteacher 's salary alone ,
and if she lied to you once , she 'll lie to you again .
he 's her manager , and he 's bad news .
well , i pulled his sheet .
great .
huh . i 'm worried about her , nick .
well , you better make sure
all right , i 'll catch up to you in a minute .
she 's in class right now .
oh , no , no , that won 't be necessary ,
uh , she has my number ,
says he tore off in a black suv .
have you talked to him ?
what was he doing in a diner where shots were fired ?
this woman 's got him really twisted up .
i just checked .
factory 's been shuttered ever since .
i 'll have brass send backup .
8 : 10 to los angeles now boarding at terminal seven .
i repeat : we have shots fired !
oh , hi , eddie .
i 'm not supposed to open the door .
she 's not here .
mm ! whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa . you missed a spot .
maybe next time you 'll be ready to do a french tip .
no . shh . keep your voice down .
there are people on fire who are not as loud as she is .
and then she started talking .
can we watch our shows now ?
what i didn 't realize is that the object of his affection
oh , big spender .
it was a lovely gesture .
she spends most of her time with the other cheerleaders .
no . that 's not what i mean .
oh , yeah , right . then .. then you could have told me
why not ? it 's .. it 's pretty funny .
the only thing i see when i look at you is a nice young man
i , uh , i won 't be talking to her anymore . i 've been forbidden .
as a friend .
well , of course you do .
eddie , there is someone out there for you .
for how long ?
but i can 't go .
my mom would never let me .
why do you care ?
you feed him a little dinner , lynette .
yeah .
i 'm out of scotch .
got any in your room ?
hi , mrs. scavo . i 'm here to fix your car .
so ...
no dice . almost at level five
do you have any idea how much medicine
you sound just like my dad .
yeah , it wasn 't a compliment .
maybe that will cheer you up .
perry ?
it was nothing anyway .
perry !
and there 's a message that i 'm sending out
i don 't like hurting people , but this is the world now .
but if i do , i vet his memories ,
the brain 's the best part .
i just want to feel what you felt .
say something
i miss airplanes .
i like that you remember that kind of stuff
shrug .
all i 'll ever be is a slow , pale ,
it 's hopeless .
i should just be happy with what i had .
it 's easier not to feel
it 's just me , kevin . it 's okay . i 'm fine .
it 's okay . i 'm not infected .
i 'm gonna forget about her ,
is that what this is ? corpses don 't get cold .
so i 'l wait here .
and it was spreading fast .
oh , no . oh , no . please , go !
that 's it ! okay .
it 's just a stupid name that we came up with
what is wrong with me ?
i 've got to tell you something .
you .. you miss him ?
like you 're attracted to him ?

and you 're just figuring this out now ?
mrs. fayden , i share your frustration .
becky could be halfway across the world by now .
mr. samson gaul .
i would not place your trust in this man . why ?

competition .
always trying to move in .
i told you ... shut up .

your daughter , she always wear her bracelet on the right .
what ?
i think so
it 's a setup . it 's all too neat . girls are nothing to them .
i think your daughter 's not dead .
it 's simple .
what do you know about a butcher ?
he didn 't .
together , they leaned on the good doctor ,
maybe the girl is not worth it .
those place is this it 's a safe hose .
look , my daughter is out there . i 'm not gonna be hiding in this house .
did you ever use one of these ? no .
this is insane . we can 't do this alone .
if anyone besides me or my son show up here , shoot him dead .
hey , where 'd you get those ? what ?
mine now .
oh , baby , where are you ?
becky , are you okay ? are you okay ?
i don 't know where i am , but you can figure it out .
what ? daddy , please do as i say .
get her computer . it 's on the desktop .
blood diamonds or other conflict minerals ,
there 's still lots of old soviet arsenal to be sold off
al rhabiri 's a collector . girls ?
virgins .
american blondes

so , what 's the plan now ?
hello ?
hold on .

is she okay ?
no , stop ! hello ?
damn it . sorry , boss , we didn 't expect the butcher .
get the kid ready to move .
please , please unlock me .
they took her to another building , i think .
please let me go .
and now they have tanya . are your guys sleepwalking over there ?
cut them off under building 3 .
i can 't bend over any further
hi . is this , like , a real dance ,
i think we 're supposed to dance like that .
even though you just saw us doing that ,
how did you two get in here ?
you wouldn 't help us ,
stick it in and i 'll watch you play .
you 'd be able to afford a hotel room ?
just like that one time at the diner .
that 's true . keep talking .
did you miss , daddy ?
why ? i will never have any use for it .
his majesty will attend the banquet .
the court is reviewing them .
why ?
why not ?
the danish people have always had
you have a flair for drama , my dear queen .
" come , let 's away to prison .
yes . thank you .
they seem to think she 's needed .
many of them are saying she is just what denmark needs .
thank you , that is quite enough !
a count is calling . better get going .
should i abandon my bleeding patient for some count ?
what the hell is wrong with it ?
you 're a bit of a mystery , struensee .
it is a rather harmless satire , mr. guldberg .
what is next . the court ? the king ? the church ?
a fine and a year 's ban on publishing will suffice .
as the letter shows , she was quite pleased and asked us to give
if we don 't , the people may ..
... 15 per tonnage .
just sign it , your majesty .
strikers to be thrown in ...
they all think i 'm crazy .
why haven 't we heard from you ?
what is he even doing out there ?
more than 700 people have died . most of them children .
have you previously tested this inoculation ?
what is the survival rate .
the king is letting himself
if foreigners like struensee ,
bernstorff , everyone here admires you and your work .
denmark had become a pioneering country admired across europe .
rantzau , it 's good to see you .
it 's not my office . this is the cabinet . how are you ?
you have ideas at the same rate as the rest of us change clothes .
we swear . we don 't know anything .
and not a word to anyone !
i saw something .
why did construction come to a halt ?
we can 't afford all the changes .
are you serious ?
all of court will go against you .
guldberg gains allies every day .
the military . are you sure ?
they say you are poisoning christian to make him insane .
the rest is about the evil foreigner ,
we have to reinstate censorship .
do it !
what do you want , priest ?
and brandt on the day of execution .
but the cabinet wants something in return .
a written statement saying you were mistaken in all your deeds .
a statement the cabinet will later publish .
i 've thought a lot about god these past few days .
that doesn 't surprise me , son .
you 're sure the execution isn 't today ?
yes , i 'm absolutely sure .
i haven 't heard anything , your majesty .
i can 't wait to see struensee 's face when i pardon him .
no . why would he be ?
who came up with the idea of
it is tradition .
people must be present to applaud their merciful king .
yes .
that 's not gonna happen .
maybe ?
okay . that 's not going to happen .
you know what we 're talking about .
this is a massive undertaking .
so what are you saying ?
i mean , everything from the lawsuit , from all of us ?
i had some money before all this .
700 grand i can get to right away .
and webber hired us , and he set a tone .
shoot . sorry . is that mine or yours ?
i think callie 's right .
it 's a much bigger opportunity ...
to stay and make the place we dreamed of work again .
oh , god . will you two stop it ?
if i have learned anything in the past year ,
and our daughter deserves
getting ready for disasters that may never happen .
everything that you 've done to make it better
i think we should go .
hey , derek . i owe you an apology .
no , no , i do .
well , we were all stressed out .
no , i know , but i had no right to call you egotistical .
on the other hand ...
cahill said it would be some brochures ,
not a whole lot of practicing medicine either .
no offense , derek .
this is a lot of it .
this is unacceptable .
yeah ?
love it . your head is gigantic .
do you prefer o.r. two or four ?
i promise you won 't remember any of this crap .
nothing .
we need to tell his parents
so ...
so ... we are going to ...
mr. finch , uh , can i , uh ,
um , are you and your wife okay ?
i don 't know . i don 't know her that well .
we hooked up one time .
and his condom breaks
i 'm gonna raise that baby .
i want to , you know ... be a father to that kid .
sorry .
we want to pool our winnings from the lawsuit
yes .
you don 't know the first thing about owning a hospital
i mean , you should hear callie 's stories .
no . n-no one leaves .
that 's why we want to buy it ,
will we ?
but see ? we don 't know anything about this .
or you 'd leave again .
owen is killing himself trying to keep the hospital open .
pack him . pack him gently .
get some factor vii in here now .
i got your page .
oh , we 're not .
it 's not real . you know , it 's just pretend .
i thought you 'd like to come in there .
what ?
i 'd learn more from watching that
this is ridiculous .
and now we 're splitting shifts ?
pegasus breaks up shifts differently .
and we get shafted . i 'm not taking this .
if you know how to talk to your people ,
look , i 'm sorry , but this is not gonna work .
chief , i just wanted to ask you again
all right , look , i am trying to work with you .
what ?
this is so stupid .
so we 're in a heist movie now ?
all right , just ... let 's go . get me in there .
what a pleasure it is to meet you , sir .
oh ! oh , my goodness . oh , oh .
meredith .
they are not approving the genome mapping at this time .
he won 't get that here .
leave seattle grace and go someplace else , fast .
that was the only medical advice i could give them in good conscience .
hey , whoa . what are you talking about ?
i tried to put on the smile and knuckle down
yeah , we 're clearly not following every wedding tradition ,
that way lily doesn 't end up looking too ...
there 's my boy .
okay , clocking out .
otherwise , i 'll just be here by myself .
your dad uses his computer to put in cool backgrounds
i would , but the coast guard keeps her really busy .
she 's probably so lonely with only two other women
37 . and it 's not what you think .
why can 't we be on a farm ?
you know what ?
you guys invited us so we could spend the day together .
couldn 't keep up , could you ?
criticisms are more hurtful when they 're specific .
hey , everybody . i 'm professor proton .
darn it , i do like objects that hover .
oh , no ! i have all those things !
it 's time for professor proton 's
because they make up everything .
yeah , because they do . they make up everything .
just when i thought this couldn 't get any better ,
what ? !
hey , thanks for being here .
how could wil ask howard to be on his show and not me ?
and he didn 't start an online petition to get wil fired .
well , because he probably worried
thank you , amy . that helps .
i heard you .
i don 't know which hemsworth is playing logan dean ,
. so a young paul giamatti .
you should talk to bernadette .
what do you mean ?
you 're a woman , you 're in science . you go , girl .
there 's like five things you gotta fix .
then i 'm not buying your house .
we made a deal . we shook on it .
these are reasonable requests . come on , mer .
we gotta be like grown-ups here .
i hate karev .
oh , motion carried .
i 'm covering the pit , and santa claus came to town .
santa ?
santa came in two weeks ago ,
so ...
not where i was going .
how many times can i say this is not happening
a person with willpower .
this is worse .
like ... like watching two cars head toward one another
people are going to die .
uh , severe abdominal pain , tremors , and he 's hypertensive .
brian , were you drinking this morning ?
no , i don 't take drugs .
it 's just a sore throat , right ?
so i want to keep her here another day
yeah .
all right , and the judge is tasting it now ,
hello .
it 's , uh , miranda bailey . how are you ?
well , i took the liberty of forwarding your e-mail on to my mother .
all right . sir .
oh , i thought i was supposed to tell dr. karev .
yeah . no one named jeff has ever done anything substantial .
nope . no roommates .
wait . you 're selling him your house ?
i 'll take the floors as is .
why don 't you shack up with kepner ?
away from you , it seems .
you still doing it with avery ?
god and everybody .
well , um , w-why don 't we talk ? we 'll see what comes up .
how do we do that ?
it 's , uh ...
so we 're talking about a sizeable award .
where 's all the money come from ?
uh , the charter company , uh , aircraft manufacturer ,
the pilot .
he broke his back . he 's paralyzed now .
well , if we find he was negligent , shouldn 't we ?
um , i 've got no residual injuries ,
folks , listen ,
but as far as the pilot is concerned ,
did you send the chart ?
i told my intern to leave the copies by the door .
i would 've thought that that was a given ,
could be a fistula . could be a dissection .
yes !
now .
she 's awesome
got it .
i 'm gonna let the ceiling thing go .
we already have a deal .
i 've been sleeping around a lot with interns .
i just , i
so don 't be that guy .
so i stopped calling the interns ,
that may just be the dumbest and the saddest thing
sir .
my mother replied to your e-mail .
because i forwarded it to her , she replied to me .
that 's rather graphic , isn 't it ?
i 'm sorry , but there are plenty of other houses in seattle
you can 't do that . escrow 's practically closed .
your scans came back completely clean .
did you come in here looking for drugs ?
can you help me out with that ?
can i just get an aspirin or something ?
perfect .
i thought he was just being a teenager
i 'd have done anything .
change your clothes . now .
you know what ? speaking of no self-respect .
let her know if you 're done or bored or whatever ,
and you couldn 't find the time to just ...
yeah , i tried .
you don 't have free reign
he should thank me .
you can confirm with an i.j. ultrasound .
come on .
the pneumonia , the complaint of shoulder pain .
but her throat cultures have been negative so far .
you spoke to my mother .
so there won 't be any more ..
let 's wait and see what russell says .
dr. hunt , dr. yang , what happened ?
it 's hard for me to change things .
so before you go
so i 'm not changing anything .
okay .
it is possible . i saw him .
there were only half a dozen people in that room .
he wasn 't there .
i do . i would have recognized him .
this is a man who took off , what , 30 years ago ?
i don 't know .
it appears that some information
it was your fat little friend , hale .
it wasn 't hale .
the next time you 're in my office ,
all i can tell is
in it , his appendix is noted as present and unremarkable .
i want the conviction overturned
these records haven 't even been certified .
the hospital does not keep records going back that far .
so as far as we know ,
let 's just all
i 'm going to delay the execution for two weeks .
contingencies .
maybe .
there 's always been another way .
man , i 'm so cold my hands are stinging .
we 're still going out through the infirmary
now wait a minute . why are you changing the plan , man ?
that 's all we gotta do is get through that pipe
people can 't get through it .
we 're going to have to find another way .
sort of .
we can go into that hole in the guards ' room .
and what about the rest of the way ?
seen a lot of rackets in my time ,
what do you do ?
you know , why don 't you just shut your word hole ?
i seen that once or twice . but iraq ?
dede , is that your wife
you feel me ?
definitely a daughter .
so , which way is the bathroom ?
hey , blue .
you found him like that .
he was sweating , you know ?
middle of the night ,
ask him yourself when the doc 's done with him .
bull 's gonna see this and flip his lid .
you got my uni ready ?
what the hell is this ?
you are as stupid as you are fat ,
you 're gonna tell me right now .
what the hell you got going on
any news ?
but you said that you had some pictures to show me .
i 'll get in touch with you
you didn 't do this .
that 's why i married you .
he could be in any one of them .
you do realize this is the treasury department , right ?
just the card , please .
don self , homeland security .
sir , i 'm sorry to barge in here ,
talk to angela down the hall .
so he 's gonna be somewhere around the perimeter of that circle .
the 10 , the 110 , the 405 .
good help is so hard to find .
we 're with upper valley insurance .
we can 't track him down , so we 're offering
i 'm sorry . i don 't recognize him .
that 's a pretty nice pot of gold .
now , it 's true
three percent of your commission
just have a seat in his office .
all we need is one more .
if i could hear him sitting down , there 's no way
well , if you recall , i successfully negotiated
now .
got it .
the monetary policy is a means to an end .
this is an important day for us .
you could 've told me all of this on the telephone .
things have happened in the past few days
that on top of the fact ,
that 's the official story .
come on , come on .
yeah , well , it 's an acquired taste .
all right , well ,
apparently , billions in counterfeit currency flooded the economy ,
i mean , so far all the cardholders
i mean , it looks like
so the question is : what 's next ?
and nothing happened , and i didn 't drink .
i 'd prefer if you didn 't smoke .
he hasn 't steered me wrong yet .
he can 't do it himself .
ex-mi6 , but he 's still an insider .
is that right ?
you should have left me alone .
they changed their plans so i could join them .
not because i couldn 't . because i ...
so they flew without me .
reza is an errand boy .
you get those sorted and you 're sorted .
your breathing as the bass .
good .
the heart blows out .
what ?
are you out of your mind ?
think of your heart as the drums .
massive blood loss ... clean through the body ...
he 's in the photograph of caleb 's squad .
he was not a stranger . you know what ?
some of these guys come back with mental health problems , laura .
wow , that is ... hmm .
yeah . they argue a lot .
yeah , that can happen .
no , no , you 're right , you 're right . let 's talk to him .
david , we 're very happy to have you here .
well , no , thank you . no . okay . suit yourself .
well , not exactly .
ugh , i 'm kind of tired . i think i 'm gonna lay down .
but allan , his name 's allan ,
but i know laura , i know she 's worried .
a coke here for my brother ,
i 'd like to buy each one of them a blowjob shot .

might be the polite thing to do .
i 'm gonna get each one of those guys a cosmopolitan .
no . blowjob shots for the ladies ,
you got it .
cash is easy to get .
got their shots and cosmos coming right up .
you want to try it ?
call the police and tell them the truth .
well , you tried to td them ,
otherwise , i imagine you and this place
here
i got into a fight with some guys at school .
some seniors were picking on me . it 's no big deal .
i don 't know , okay . i 'm just going to go to my room , all right
did he get in trouble at the school ?
where do you want these ?
my man , welcome to the party .
it 's fine . he 's a big boy .
but now i 'm saving money for college ,
well , he 's a drug dealer .
yeah . he sells drugs sometimes to , like , friends for extra cash .
in my opinion , if you 've seen one of these , you 've seen them all .
i mean , it 's got absolutely no kick at all .
yes , sir .
she had bruises on her body .
anyway , uh , we will leave it for the police
damn thing is this makes me regional manager .
right away they want me to start tomorrow .
well , that 's , uh ..
they told me that david collins died a week ago .
there was a fire from oxygen tanks .
does david have any id ? credit cards ?
why don 't you check some of the numbers he 's called ?
have him look some of them up .
sure .
otherwise , you 'll carry it with you the rest of your life .
yeah
what 's the worst they can do ?
here . you keep it .
yeah , man , it 's yours . i 've got others .
he lost his license two years ago
that 's what i 'm trying to figure out .
the cops found those drugs in zeke 's room ,
get any information you can on this guy .
yeah . i do .
oh , you 're inviting me over to eat ?
oh , that 's so nice . i 'd love to .
oh , i 'm a vegetarian . except for fish .
well , that 's interesting . leonard can 't process corn .
oh , yeah . i 'm a waitress at the cheesecake factory .
you 're lactose-intolerant .
even though i hate his lying , cheating guts ..
yes .
it 's uh .. uh ... it 's a paradox .
oh , of course .
however briefly .
it 's darth vader shampoo .
wait till you see this .
see what ?
this isn 't a good time .
why ?
leonard has a lady over .
which is ?
that 's a biological impossibility .
try to hit on penny in russian , arabic and farsi .
you did not break up with joyce kim . she defected to north korea .
this situation is much less complicated .
she just wanted to avoid having a scene with him .
i 've done a bad thing to you , mom .
do you want to come with me ?
lidya is calling us . let 's go .
why are you still using a broken mirror ?
may i speak frankly ?
a cracked mirror is dangerous . one day , it could completely shatter .
so is glenn coming here ? is he going to take me to the airport ?
hey , panji , take a look . " xbox . " i really want to have this .
then you should ask mom to buy it for you . she 's going on a long trip .
well , if i were you , i would just ask for it .
just go and eat that bread until your stomach explodes !
children that wander around outside after dark .
especially children who are lonely and in need of a mother 's love .
did i scare you ?
don 't worry , auntie . please give my regards to anton .
yes , mom .
no , honey . i won 't be long . i 'll only be gone for three weeks .
of course you can , honey .
babe , be careful , okay ? don 't drive too fast ,
especially a beautiful daughter like you .
yes , i am .
what are you doing here ?
do you know why ? where 's the book ?
you are having nightmares , because you keep reading this stuff !
come on , let 's go back to sleep .
what did you see anyway ?
viewers , we can see there is a lot of junk that was left deliberately
that 's the mirror that 's in the storeroom .
i am here to interview the local citizens who are mr. lukman 's neighbors
i will always come back .
i miss you , mom .
of course , mom .
this is from ambar 's clothes .
what is it , dinda ?
remember , kuntilanak can enter our world .
single !
hello , total strangers . welcome .
if anyone asks who you are ,
i 'm gonna go look for the bathroom .
oh , look , she is so nervous , it 's adorable .
i 'm not allowed to look her in the eye , so no .
just pick it up , blow on it , and put it back on the tray .
that 's what we said .
i think it 's because we love to have fun ,
let 's go make her day .
um , that 's lily .
i-is she talking to me ?
of course , ms. loveandstuff .
we 're here at my launch party
mother 's recipe .
i don 't know , phil .
i 'm just not feeling it .
what are we doing , bill ?
okay , first of all ,
mm-hmm , mm-hmm . so , what were you doing
how did you know i was in a jewelry store ?
and i could do with someone like you to help me dig out some more .
but we 're small for a reason . trust .
but they 're nothing compared to what 's coming for you .
we can keep them out of reach . but i need you .
tama 's job is to bribe everyone .
if we get you close enough to bangun ,
so , what 's the next step ?
it 's the perfect opportunity . get in , get close .
it will only be a few months .
but if i don 't do this ,
he 's out of the hospital now , right ?
shut your fucking mouth !
at the very least , it gives you two something to talk about .
he 's also a major benefactor .
rama , listen ,
i believe benny and his boys introduced themselves yesterday ?
him .
oh , yeah ? and who are you ?
and when you do , maybe you 'll show me a little more fucking respect .
that alone makes me a target here .
your job is to protect me here .
we 're going to his office .
he doesn 't have to .
okay ?
sounds familiar .
he 's been making waves of late .
the kind that can 't afford to carry a spotlight .
i 'm getting rumors that he 's looking to expand his operations .
that 's where the rumors stop .
i 'll never forget that .
i 've thanked you in person .
but when it comes to the work ,
i won 't let you down .
you have pretty much everything you need .
i 'll pick you up tomorrow at 8 : 00 .
it 's me .
you 're gonna get me fucking killed . day one with a wire ?
yeah , well , he fucking checked me anyway . they burnt all my clothes .
if you do that again , i 'm out .
no , i 'm not disclosing that , and don 't you dare trace this fucking call .
calm down , the important thing is you 're safe .
this guy , any hint at all , and he will sniff it out .
thank you .
with people like these , you can 't predict how they will react .
and the reaction would be exactly the same .
if they did , we wouldn 't be side-stepping puddles of piss to get to them .
not for a second
it 's all there in the envelope .
not enough ?
oh , yeah . go back a month and you 're right .
but this month , you 're short $ 5000 .
motherfucker , stop shaking around .
fuck this shit . where the fuck did you find this guy ?
i hope you 're right .
so take care of him .
you don 't have to do that , i get it .
to support you .
only they don 't come home with blood on their hands .
who the fuck do you think you are ?
if you rush into this it won 't help , it will make things worse .
this is a shitty situation ,
i 'm just trying to help , i know how much your father .
who the fuck do you think you are ? huh ?
you mean nothing to him .
after that , we 're just going to cut you free .
go fuck yourself .
murder , extortion , bribery ?
you were never investigating bangun , you knew that
none of us are heroes
everything i 've built was for you .
you destroyed it completely . huh ?
tell me why . huh ? huh ?
for what ?
i know where you 're from .
we come from the same place .
our fates don 't end up the same .
and as i dug deeper , i realized ..
we are now the commodity .
that no one bothered to read the terms and conditions .
armed with this knowledge , they compete for my attention ,
what i like ,
crooked hillary tells lots of lies .
my daughter is eight , and my son is four .
are you okay with that ? "
i 've been concerned for a long time
it was really , like , a feeling of , like .
i became obsessed with finding answers .
this was our project alamo , where the digital arm
we had the facebook , and youtube , and google people .
cam bridge . analytica was here .
and this is kind of the brain of .. of , you know , the data .
" we gotta target this state . we gotta target that state . "
that 's . that 's their secret sauce .
i 'm there .
and cambridge analytica claimed to have 5,000 data points
and so the question is , how do you make the invisible visible ?
paul-olivier dehaye had a hypothesis ,
i think the beauty of david 's case is it encapsulates
after the election , it was really exciting .
we were on top of the world
" this is the inauguration . "
steve bannon headed the campaign for trill m o .
anyway , and then he told me all sorts of other stuff
people just give it to you ! "
um , i am incredibly remorseful for my ... my role in setting it up .
but there 's been a lot of attention on me because i 'm sort of .. i 've become the
but someone else that you should be calling to the committee is brittany kaiser .
i 'm not that interested in standing up for powerful white men anymore
google , facebook , amazon , tesla .
data is the most valuable asset on eartih .
it wasn 't until one of my friends reached out to me
i 'm a political technologist
there is , you know , that there 's something wrong here ,
i went and found her and met her ,
i think we now have the foundations laid for ..
uh , and , uh ... her inbox and her hard drive ,
in november 2015 ,
and he said , " this is the set of the apprentice .
t was kind of shocked , you know ?
so this wasn 't just an outfit that you put on , and it felt important ?
i feel like the main problem in us politics
" how much of facebook 's revenue
the reality is that facebook knows more about this
yeah , it is . um , lit ...
yeah .
of leave eu 's press launch .
and i was like , well , here ook , it 's brittany kaiser !
she 's at the press launch
how can you carry on denying it ? this is nuts !
there was a spoof video of a scene from airplane !
please , let me handle this .
go back to your seat ! i 'll take care of this .
and the whole thing they had ,
last time i left ,
yes .
and there 's still this whole group of people that are wondering ,
earlier this morning , he announced some new measures
so , we 're getting to the bottom of exactly what cambridge analytica did .
.... to address this and to prevent it from happening again .
well , mr. zuckerberg
senator , i don 't know that our employees were involved with cambridge analytica .
whoa !
the republican team in dc was . i met them .
i didn 't realize how much i had .
did you get the chance to look through all of that ?
but we don 't talk about that .
do you worry at all that she might let you down ?
that is a good question .
you know , done some complicated things .
you know , some things get broken and stay broken .
very pleased to welcome brittany kaiser to give evidence to
uh , sol pacebook had announced to all of their clients
she 's , like , contradicting nix a lot , what he said previously .
you were working on the campaign , but just not being , paid fo ru
let 's defeat her in november .
nobody recognized it .
i watched it in the new york office with , um , all the staff there .
and i think everybody was ..
everybody walked away from the screen in silence back to their desks .
mr. nix , can i ask you what your message is
but cambridge amalytica 's gone .
that because of the way that this technology is moving so fast ,
after we dealt with the threats
is the guardian 's stand on this a purely politically partisan one
this is about the integrity of our democracy .
and i would think that you would have an interest in that also .
roger , even if , uh , facebook hasn 't broken any laws ,
i mean , i spent three months , starting in october 2016 , trying to say ,
just taking all of the basic tricks of propaganda ,
and basically playing on instincts ,
there 's 2.1 billion people , each with their own reality .
and the other thing about this is , they know that it 's killing me ..
yeah. you get tested in your life a few times , right ?
i was either gonna stand up and do something about this ,
i mean , i felt really guilty .
sleep at night .
what happened with you
and , um , when your family loses all their money
um , yeah , but it took a while for it all to really fall apart .

hey , my own personal flurry .
the only frozen heart around here is yours .
we shall see
this is unacceptable .
i 've been traumatized . ow ! my neck hurts .
millions of images , automatically .
it was only then where we saw the whole planet .
and , yeah , the alarm bells go off .
the problem is not traditional farming techniques .
it takes a lot of resources to rear an animal ,
i just did such a horrible job the first time ,
can i at least , uh , read you the speech that i wrote ?
okay .
but i thought we were just gonna cut back ,
then i decided i want a slightly bigger life ,
well , maybe not now , but if i work my way up the ladder ,
what kind of ladder are we talking about here ?
i don 't know yet . that 's where the employment lady comes in .
actually , i 'm hoping i won 't be single for long .
so we 're done talking about me ?
great .
i figure i 'll just come clean ,
really ? because your sister told me you lost your job .
didn 't you get any of the messages i left ?
in fact , i met someone .
so you 're really engaged
yeah , and remember , you 're happy i 've moved on , right ?
i know what you must be thinking . it 's too soon .
mom .
well , you know , people change .
oh , it 's a real cute story .
and by " mistake , "
isn 't she adorable ? uh-huh .
i 'd like to get some tea biscuits ,
andrew , i do not understand .
look , i-i know it 's not who you were expecting ,
just be happy for me .
you can 't tell me what to do .

i don 't even like my own .
i said taupe . this is clearly beige .
second floor , third mannequin from the left . look alive .
no lady wants to see anything under 4 inches .
you go away .

and a red patent leather clutch .
everything looks and smells so amazing , mrs. van de kamp .
that way i eat just a little bit now ,
not before i take a picture of her .

my parents have been pretty generous .
none of your business , mom .
they invented mary beth 's frozen custard .
recognize me ? the kid on the carton ?
you bought ... one boot ?
one day i 'll buy the other one .
because i got a call from the bank .
huh . maybe it was stolen .
by a size o with incredibly expensive taste .
i bought a gift for a woman
i met with that job lady .
i didn 't finish school . i 've never had a real job .
i just feel like my life
what about marrying me ?
you do know that m.j. just lost his father , right ?
but there is no place for violence in my classroom ,
no . no , no , you 've been wonderful .
mom , what the hell is this ?
hey , girl . i haven 't seen you in ages .

i 'm brian with an " i. "
they used to be here all the time .
they seem sweet and very well-groomed .
mrs.van de kamp , i know andrew 's gay .
i just kind of gave up .
but then i met andrew . he 's sweet , fun ,
honestly , it 's a little scary
yeah , i did go a little overboard , huh ?
it smells amazing in here .
i hate for it to go to waste .
mary beth is on her way back to wisconsin .
why are you so concerned about her life ?
we ducked in there to dry off .
a lot of water under that bridge , huh ?
look how young we were .
back then i could actually see without my reading glasses .
i ... don 't know .
give up .
" you belong with me . " it 's ..

halloween 's a phony holiday , anyway .

after what he did to me , i don 't care .
he is ?
i went to the site last night .
they say it 's not a heart attack ,
why is he having chest pains ?
oh , is it the money thing ?
for giving me the day off .
and if you 're willing to keep torturing my kids ,
what 's all this ?
i taught them some basic forestry procedure .
you might want to keep an eye on that .
you are absolutely welcome to stay here ...
yeah , well , i don 't know if i 'm gonna make it that long .
what ?
you know , the foul moods and the nagging
and god knows i got my own baggage .

you know what ? don 't worry . you let me work on him .
if 's french apple . it 's his favorite .

i mean it . i 'm still crazy about you .
well , don 't worry about me . i can take care of myself .
you 're doing a hell of a job .

i just didn 't think was gonna end like this .
oh , it 's just a rough patch .
i don 't know about that .
if 's about finding the one who 'll be there ,
karen would be that person for me .
so we got your m.r.i. back ,
she knew it was very dangerous .
but susan delfino was determined
thank you for choosing to spend time with me .
how aout we stan
i 'm sorry . that 's not gonna happen .
oh , once again , i am so sorry .
next time , i will pick a place with fewer forks .
well , i ... i had a lot of fun .
keith ?
yeah . why do you ask ?
well ? any luck finding a nanny ?
they 're all either too inexperienced
and that 's why we 're not hiring her .
you did ? you took the initiative ?
our christmas lights are still up from last year .
who is it ?
lynette , remember how you always used to hate yams ?
what 'd you do ?
i could have , but i didn 't want to get punched .
there are other houses , paul .
fortunately . i have another way to handle this .
and this will be your balance .
we should have a lot more money in here .
okay . um ...
hey .
what do you need it for ? you guys going on a fancy date ?
that was a stupid mistake , and it 's over .
big this time .
i 'm sorry , doug , but i 'm actually happy here .
come on . can 't be happy here in mayberry .
oh , by the way . cartier called .
think about everything we had together .
don 't you ?
what do you think the angel represented
meanwhile , we had ten great years ,
well , you have invested ten years in the marriage .
okay , then . i 'm doing it .
have you been working this whole time ?
so if there is nothing else ,
i 'd hate to see you out there driving
totally .
then stay .
uhh !
sure you will . i 'll just buy you a sapphire ring .
well , get ready to smell it .
my nose ! my nose !
other than hiding all the sharp objects around here
oh , well , i was going to spend the night
well , uh , how about you keep the store open late ,
yeah , the theme will be that the greatest love
oh , dr. cooper , thank you .
oh , no , no . that 's not going to happen , no .
well , i guess those chaps will have to have
let 's see .
this is about $ 2,000 .
contribute to my work .
did you just pee on me ?
see , you have a fake voice , too .
you know what ? tell her she 's got to get her act together
excuse me ?
we don 't wallow in our self-pity .
it formed because of a congenital heart defect ,
the first one will repair the aneurysm .
and we thought we were ready for everything .
we 're prepared for a nuclear holocaust .
are we expecting a nuclear holocaust ?
yeah , well , mark always kept track of that stuff .
ooh . she 's losing a lot of blood ?
suction .
okay , wilson , just get in there

dr. yang , i suggest you get one , too .
we tracked down the young woman 's parents in toronto .
suction , and let 's hang more blood .
grey , we 've replaced her entire volume of blood four times .
it might be time to pack her and let her rest .
this is a bad idea .
i can 't tell you how strenuously i object
you know , condoms don 't protect against that .
you were the first one to point out ,
yes , but ..
well , what about parker ?
can i assume that 's your child i hear
right . okay . sorry . forget it .
he 's doing it , mer .
and if he does it , he 'll get fired .
i need to figure out
i was just a resident along for the ride .
i take it you weren 't able to convince him to go gracefully ?
he 's a liability .
no , because habitually undermines my authority .
yeah , he saved our patient 's life .
you came in a little strong ,
and once he 's gone , you 'll see that .
these vessels are so fragile .
you 're gonna have to suction like your life depends on it .
i 'm trying , but there 's a lot of bleeding over here .
i thought i was .
don 't be crass .
you 're fighting a battle that women of my generation
you know what ? these sutures aren 't holding .
mediocre surgeons will see you
do not look for friends here .
none of these people have the capacity to understand you .
you don 't need the hour .
meredith .
that 's great .
no , no , no .
did you pick him up off the floor of a bar , lexie ?
meredith , no , i 'm not ...
now that could be surgical .
let 's get that blood hung .
dr. bailey ,

um , thatcher , the transplant board has a rule here .
i 'm only 90 days .
you 're not asking .
you want a kidney ? i 'll throw in one of those , too .
you 're all cranky and , uh , in a bad mood .
end-stage liver disease. he needs my liver .
go ahead ,
okay , my dad needs the transplant
we need to decide these things together .
i would i 'll page you
okay. a little pinch .
try knocking it on something .
what other tricks you know ?
oh , and if your arm starts to hurt from all ths nail put
stage iv melanoma .
so you may want to leave the room for this
hey , i was gonna propose last year , but i got distracted
the ring 's at home in the mouth guard container ,
what we 'd do is we 'd surgically place
he needs a liver transplant .
i left the room. he 's not my father .
ooh. maybe not. maybe he 's dead this time .
it 's worse than i thought .
god , it looks like
we don 't .
with this many adhesions ,
so , no , i will not lie ,
how would you like it
why not ?
i mean , she 's just been through hell .
just give her one , alex .
i guess when you save someone 's life ,
ooh. i wanted to show you something. i made a list .
yeah , to read to the chief .

and i know that he 's not your dad .
yes , ma am .
terrific .
yeah , putting a bicycle pump in some old man 's junk ...
i ... i haven 't just been waiting
yeah . i just didn 't want to saddle her down with a sick husband .
so .. what the hell ?
you shouldn 't .
you ready ?
one of you has cancer , one of you died .
all right , let 's see what we got here .
i 'll understand if you wanna pass .
this might be a joke to all of you ,
these hands were made for surgery .
instead they removed a tick and pumped a penis .
my point ?

wow , you 're really giving those bands a workout .
they don 't ask questions on a college tour , right ?

i 'm so confused .
you talk about it with your friends .
i don 't know how many times i have to tell you this .
for years ?

he provokes me , and i push him away ,
eventually .
we thought we 'd move closer to her
it just never occurred to me
mommy , why do you look so sad ?
what 's going on ?
no one likes the idea .
oh , l should 've stopped at just one drink .
i hope so , because if they don 't ,
just put ' em on a little plate .

we tested the recipe last night , and it was perfect ,
did you give andrew 's keys to anyone after you fired him ?
oh , bree .
the publisher guy 's giving a little speech ,

well , it 'd have to be somebody pretty smart ..
sam :
she 's got no idea .

actually , um , no .
benji , you are connected .
the package is still on that plane .
with neither the access nor the ability
imf suspects this to be the same shadow organization
normally , you and your team would be tasked
and now we know who you are .
pursue us , you 'll be caught . resist us , you 'll be killed .
without the secretary 's approval . yes , we know .
well . i didn 't write the rules , mr. hunley .
a throwback to an era without transparency and without oversight .
this one 's a fighter .
are you worry he 's gonna take your place ?
yeah , he 's right .
now , let 's see how tough you are .
all of them are either missing or dead , everyone .
russian , french , british , israelis , you name it .
and he always seems to be a step ahead of us .
are you suggesting i 'm helping him ?
and yet every week , you hold me in here .
and today , you haven 't answered it .
okay , nothing could be further from the truth .
i owe him nothing
ethan , where are you ? where the hell have you been ?
everything is going to be fine . just keep walking
but i can 't find him alone . are you in ?
yes , of course . of course .
the show 's about to start , benji .
just take your position , tell me what you see .
nice tux , by the way .
investigation lead him to the opera .
in any case . finding hunt is no longer our pet project .
new identity , passport , cash , road map .
everything you need to make it to dc undetected .
i 'm suppose .. what ? sorry , what ?
you came to vienna believing you won 2 tickets to the opera .
he was at the opera tonight .
former mossad .
tonight , i made it official .
the same day a car accident killed the visiting president of malawi .
right before a fired petrochemical plant gassed a village of 2,000 people .
that missing plane was carrying the secretary of the world bank .
that wreck triggered a civil war .
they 're links in a chain . the work of a single organization , the syndicate .
regardless if who 's in the way .
killing the chancellor tonight was a statement
i was there
i don 't know who he is , where he 's from .
ethan , this is what i sign up for .
we need to find ethan before they do .
not interested .
look , man . i know ethan . i don 't know you .
yeah , all i know about you is you chose to resign .
they 'll never catch him
things are out of control and they 're going to kill him .
we have to get to them first . are you going to help me ?
i believe you
so , to get the ledger , one of us needs to enter the torus
that 's the only way . that 's the only way .
what 's that ? tha ' s the service hatch
in the pipeline . and before you ask .
no oxygen tanks .
2 minutes . with the current at full power .
well . that 's gonna be like a minute tops .
the more you exert yourself , the faster you consume oxygen .
all he has to do is install the fake profile before i get to the gait analysis .
so , how are we suppose to find ethan and benji before they do ?
what do you mean ?
ethan 's not exactly sure who this guys is .
he trust her .
find her , find tthan
listen . i don 't want to sound ungrateful , okay .
one of these days , you 're gonna take it too far .
we 're gonna nail that
i said i could locate him . you 've to find him
if that were true then my goal would be to spread fear , but my .
you kill innocent people .
a virtual red box which i alone would control
furthermore , i was given every assurance it never pass the planning stage .
these people have been duped by agent faust .
there is no secret he cannot extract . no security he cannot breach .
he has mostly likely anticipated this very conversation
and he has made you his mission .
your friend is sitting on a highly sensitive
your final test .
if not , everyone dies .
human nature , my weapon of choice .
whether you let her run in morocco . whether she went to atlee or not .
then again .
somewhere along the line you had a crisis of faith .
without ever asking who is giving the orders .
is t-bag in that hotel ?
well , then you 're gonna help us get it then .
i don 't care.i didn 't travel 2,000 miles down the diarrhea trail ...
well , that 's too bad
and if you don 't think i 'm serious ,
you 're gonna help him get the money
shame on me .
i said get the gun off me or i walk .
you get maricruz ,
but you got to do exactly what i say .
be that as it may ,
the tape is allowed .
it 's who survives .
that son of a bitch took my girl , locked her up somewhere .
look at me .
and if that 's your game ,
i was supposed to meet my old lady there a half hour ago .
they say you can 't miss it , but i missed it .
why don 't you just keep on walking , pal ?
listen , beat it .
let 's say that 's the case .
because i am in possession of some information
maybe i 'll let you walk ..
yeah .
my ...
uh , and i did terrible things ,
then you should never have come down here .
thank god for that .
kept ..
you can walk or get dragged .
no . see , when you had the gun on me ,
well , the scales are tipped back my way .
either we split this money ,
and this goes ? ok , against the wall .
thank you . ok . ok . it 's fragile .
but , mom ...
oh , come on . come on .
yeah , dad , who was that lady in your office today ?
i don 't know . just some lady .
tf looks so small

oh , of course .

in the room . nothing personal .
burned beyond recognition . while his estate was dismantled
the glass , thereafter known as the lasser glass ,

drugs is almost as bad as escape .
it wasn 't drugs .
i want to make sure i heard you straight .
this isn 't about a vote .
now , we have a nation that is growing increasingly hungry for alternate energy .
besides , once that bill hits the president 's desk , he 'll veto it .
you probably don 't have a hair on your body , do you ?
i want you to notify me immediately if and when that happens .
you scared me .
you don 't want to make any rash mistakes here , l .
small potatoes compared to this , i 'm sure ,
it would ?
nobody ? okay , i 'm going in .
i can 't get anything past you , huh , tom ?
yeah , well , you know , i wanted to come here and tell you guys in person .
well , easy enough . let 's just do that again , then . next ?
if you have a different idea , i would love to hear that , too .
well , let me help you .
my mom and mrs . hodge are still talking about that ball thing .
like i want to put on a stupid white dress and greet people all night .
by the way , i 'm doing it .
because i did it last year , and it 's actually kind of hilarious and great .
it doesn 't sound great . it sounds beyond lame .
julie !
okay , you know what ? this is getting ridiculous .
let me go !
hi , daddy .
i need to talk to your dad . thanks .
let me answer that question with another question .
so it 's time for you to live yours .
i 'm just dropping off a few letters .
i 'll be quicker if i do it myself .
i don 't believe this . i was worried sick about you !
you promised me a fun day , and all i got is a sunburn on the right side of my face .
you had me out here , sitting like a dog with the window cracked open .
well , why shouldn 't i get something out of this ?
look over here , mr. monroe ..
have been arguing for a reduction of the licence fee for ...
i beg your pardon .
come on .
of course not .
knows she 's not going to win .
she actually gives less of a shit about anyone round here than he does ,
a career politician .
can i just make a couple of points ?
what is this for ? that 's what you wanted to know , mr monroe .
what are you for ? what are you for ?
jamie ?
you can 't avoid it .
'the video of his clash
'you look less human than i do
'you 're just an old attitude with new hair .
'no-one takes you seriously . ' 
why does it ...
i know ! i 've got my ..
i got that . in there ? ok .
he doesn 't even have a surname .
today , an official mascot for protest voters .
make a nice prawn cocktail .
i 've got one big blue point to make , fool .
oh , god . thank you .
it 's the waldo polling app .
there 's something i 'd like to talk to you about .
john , i just drove 3 hours to come and see you .
and i 'll kick down this door if i have to
i 've got a situation that i 'd like you to take a look at .
i told you , i 'm not interested .
that is my loyal partner , agent cowles ,
he was eating ice cream . he was .
well .
the residence of mrs. ethel jackson , age 69 .
asking our permission to reveal himself , yet never intending to .
is it a cry for help ?
this is too controlled , too sharp .
which she 's going to go home now and finish .
i 'll see you in the morning .
john ? no , none for me
my boy 's having a rough time in school . came home in tears again today .
yeah .
i know . just give him a hug . tell him a joke , a pat in the back .
yeah . a joke .
in the name of friendship , tell me a joke .
okay , just one . um ..
the doctor prescribes male hormones to up her testosterone , 2 pills a day .
" doctor . that hormone medicine is doing wonders for my heart .
john , i can 't tell that to my little boy .
it 's a good joke , isn 't it ?
i thought you 'd like that .
why was that ? that smile .
just don 't touch it . i 'm not sure why .
who ?
the husband
agent cowles , are you ready ?
i want you to take the lead .
been a long night for all of us . thank you .
.. i 'm just gonna jump right into this . okay ?
inside my own daughter , for example . she had leukemia .
and one day she died .
in the end , of course , it was a bit of a blessing
and , uh , i certainly wouldn 't use medicine to alter god 's plan .
and medicine can help me discover that .
who killed your little boy .
look for a man with little personal hygiene ,
and for christ 's sakes find the bottom half of that dress
hey , cop !
maybe you 're right , john .
maybe that 's exactly what he wants , because we found a clue , john .
call it a personal favor .
something really bad
that 's great . can you please step outside with us ?
no . your studio is safe . step outside .
on baltimore , in pursuit .
right !
yellow cab . he 's stolen a yellow cab .
i want to teach my little boy to drive .
i know .
we want for so much in life , you know ?
but i 've run out of time . there 's no time left .
my friend .
bring me everything .
hmm .
yeah , well . that 's what 20 minutes with a rich geriatric will get you , huh .
i guess , you know . whatever they think is right .
no , there 's none , there 's none ,
yes . i was conflicted about you .
yeah . you had no right to take one hour , one minute ,
i mean really know them and ...
if you had , perhaps you would have appreciated how time at the end is ...
at that point , even the pain of life itself
that her .
who the fuck are you guys ?
i don 't see you pulling that trigger .
i 'm simply a man who could no longer look away .
god knows , i would prefer to live the cuiet life
there you go .
day after day . month after month .
he 's got a gun !
we have radio contact with the engineer .
have him stop the train there .
man 's underwater best friend .
i was going to .
wait a minute . you hate dogs .
aka jogging .
certainly .
and one particularly persistent p.e. teacher
i know !
then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women .
what 's the matter ?
i 'm behind you .
i am looking at you .
pay no attention to that man in the bed .
not here and certainly not at work .
at my age , do you know
an accident .
until i can transfer my intellect
i can 't take any more of this . i won 't !
how many people can claim that ?
yes , one of over one-and-a-half billion .
oh , i see perfectly well .
do stay , mr. lint .
you said that last time !
i want to go to that cold place and find them .
um , i wouldn 't have to spend the rest of my life alone .
please ?
i can 't possibly .
you 're a . you 're a great man .
you must understand ,
proof ? what kind of proof ?
well , you can 't very well walk around naked .
yeah , but i mean , his underwear , too ?
i mean , i turned them inside-out and all , but ..
fine , fine . by all means , crack open the win ...
should you perhaps wait here ?
do you shed ?
you plan to travel all the way around the world to the himalayas ,
yes , that 's right .
did i leave something out ?
oh , absolutely . like a brother to me .
yes , well , goodbyes are so tricky .
oh , come , now , adelina . i think you know the answer to that .
and aldous was there for me in ways you never were .
ugh ! i can 't even look at you right now .
there 's no need to get upset . such a sensitive creature .
like a ... . like an unhappy bird locked in a cage .
such a vibrant , spirited , intoxicating woman .
i would never wish to obtain the map
get out !
i mean , that 's against the law .
put this on .
do you have a size bigger ?
on your head . it 's a disguise .
look , just forget about the stocking .
what .. what did you just do ?
i didn 't mean all of it .
i mean to get to the himalayas ,
something you said to me .
aldous believed if we find shangri-la ,
i 'm a quiet guy at heart ,
that was fun .
and yet here you are in front of my face .
all these years , my husband searched for this .
i wish he could have been here to see it .
come in .
what do you say to a peace offering ?
hmm . yes , i thought perhaps we might clear the air .
no , no , no . my air is clear .
he thinks so highly of you , lionel .
and yet you treat him so poorly .
you poke him with your stick .
i can 't allow you to go any further .
hand in hand with apes and women .
yeah , but there 's something else .
they 're calling it the grey .
like entire regions of the country are being wiped off the map .
so what are you gonna do ?
yes sir , i did .
yeah . well , because he stole john wick 's car , sir
two million .
put tosef in the red circle and wait
thank you .
and i 've got a phone .
would you kill john wick for two million dollars ?
no , it 's open .
consider it done .
i know i can trust you . thanks for the drink .
i 'm familiar with the parlance , jonathan .
have you returned to the fold ?
have you thought this through ?
you got out once .
where can i find him ?
oh . well , um ..
i just won some money in the lottery .
$ 87 million !
oh ! some " going out " thongs .
ah ! captain pantsuit , in on it as well ?
everything is fine , brigitte . you and albert may go .
i 'll take my lunch by the pool !
what do you want , penny ?
like , look at this place !

and why would i do that ?
with penny , we can finally run the " lord of the rings " play .
who 's the first mark ?
l can 't marry you .
what problem 's so big you don 't think
but you don 't mind , do you , darling ?
but howard ! the ring !
the student doesn 't earn wages
l 've been killing myself
be honest , now .
l even hired this guy barry to follow me around
well , there must be something .
that does , like , really cutting-edge stuff .
well , how much does this doctor charge ?
she 's using all your tricks !
let 's use some of hers .
what 's your story ?
these french investor guys , uh , flew me out here ,
mmm . can i have another one ?
as such , you must surely know
because this is how the visually impaired function in the world .
would you ?
he loves you ?
well , then it appears we have our solution .
but i thought you didn 't nail your marks .
oh , so you thought you could play us , yeah ?
babes , this is not a good situation for you .
don 't go to the hotel now , jo .
come off it .
why did you give him $ 500,000 ?
ilo !
" penny . i honestly meant what i said just now ,
i was taught that by my nana . or as you may know her ...
you 're thomas 's nana .
all right . okay .
cathy ! cathy , baby , you get that
i have to catch my breath .
you 're in mint condition and you know it .
i was showing cathy here some luxury property in capri ,
cathy 's an animal lover , see ,
yes it is . now , cathy , what is it you wanted to start ?
a rare animal sanctuary and soa .
you can drop the act now .
great , by the way . you haven 't aged a day .
is this an intervention ?
okay , when and where did you bump your head today ?
will you excuse me ?
this is your second chance to say yes to his marriage proposal .
you are here because regret has ruined your life .
this is gonna sound stupid .
but my mom made me promise that i wouldn 't , so i became a cop .
but you didn 't ?
when this came around , i figured : " this is my chance to play soldier , "
uh , for luck .
revenge on a childhood bully .
i 'm not sure how you should take a bucket of toilet water
i was having a lot of anxiety , so my mom forced me to go see this shrink ,
anyway , dr. torture ,
i just want to feel what it 's like to be on the other end .
to feel something ?
mr. sullivan , do you mind giving us some privacy ?
in the meantime , feel free to do push-ups or crunches .
yeah , that would be a start .
i was talking to you both .
time to make amends for your past and ask for forgiveness .
stop giving this teenage version of her all this dang power over your life .
god , you two remind me of my daughter .
let 's go .
please , no !
no , no !
we should 've never come here .

she said you agreed to jump from this height .
... the game became real ?
you don 't have any family
oh , by the way ..

i just told them to be on their best behavior ,
yes , hi .
who could be that messed up
i better get rid of her before joe
buried deeply staying within
bernie was a very charismatic man .
and he had the ability to make the world seem kind .
when nothing else could help ,
real good with people , a real people person ,
he 'd remember that and he 'd ask you questions about those kids .
when nothing else could help now
he 's the master of the sea ,
love lifted me .
i 'd just soon drop you in a ditch
yeah , this is ... this is fine .
yeah .
and also no warranty , of course .
oh , with our better caskets .
oh , thank you .
i never asked him to do this and
i mean , that guy was just a sweet guy ,
hi , i 'm just dropping by again , mrs. nugent ,
don 't you think you were meant to do something more ?
it isn 't bad at all .
it 's just my wav to serve
and some day , if i 'm lucky , many many years from now ,
you know , i think that bernie was the one
think about it , now . god bless you .
no . i insist .
okay , mrs. nugent , bye .
that was bernie tiede. the assistant funeral director .
can 't think of anyone who 's been that nice to me in 50 years .
now you sure about that ?
she 's a very lonely person . she needs someone .
well , have fun .
hell , maybe she 'll even pay for everything .
hey ...
he sincerely believed that ...
well , bernie had a problem with money .
i used to love having him on the air .
and when he did the obituaries ,
left in sorrow to mourn the passing of the beloved mr. gunnolds
like gunnolds was a drunk ,
the word was it wasn 't a week after the funeral
in a small town , people will always
sittin ' in some hot spring mineral peeling water bath .
you see pictures of her on these trips with bernie .
she seemed happy ,
she could do anything she wanted in her life ,
until she met bernie .
on that trip to belize ,
and i know for sure
she got herself a see-through nightgown
what is a woman her age
i mean , an unmarried man in his late 30s ,
that dog don 't hunt . nah .
i always thought he was celibate .
he stayed busy all the time and was working .
now if you 've ever seen bernie teide , you know dam well
i call this my wheel of misfortune .
if your number comes up ,
not one .
you see , i was having trouble finding them .
what i did , is i got a rig
did it work ?
hey , get him !
and we 'd like to get a thousand shares of tommv hilfiger .
what is this " we 'd like to " part . bernie ?
let me remind you : you bury people .
i 'm sure we won 't be late for lunch ,
this is my life .
she got rid of all the usual help
bernie ! you should 've been here hours ago !
i need you to go by the cleaners and pick up my dress .
you fooling around with those damn planes all the time , bernie .
okay , you told me . what good does that do me ?
this wagon has all of our instruments on it
grrr . so i want to have a pulse on each beat ,
one , two , three , four and oh !
this is only going to take a second .
hello , marjorie , how are you ?
can it wait till right after rehearsal ?
okay , right away . i 'll be there .
how 's it going , carl ?
what happened ?
oh , jesus , no , no , no , what have i done ?
please tell me what to do !
it seemed like the flags were a little late ,
but it was a really great job .
i don 't think too many of us
yes , yes , she missed her holiday haircut appointment
well , i 'm sorry to say this
i was rather devastated at the very idea
it was easy for her to disappear .
not her son , not her two sisters .
well , yeah , he hired me back for more money ,
he paid 40,000 dollars for carthage awards .
he loaned the money to the yokums over here ,
bernie just told everybody to pay him back when they could .
but they never did .
vou knnow ? little girls .
thank you .
you 've done more to transform
lloyd seems to be pretty concerned .
oh , good lord , you gotta be kidding me .
it 's like i told him .
she didn 't want everyone to know ,
that 's mariorie alright .
you know , bernie , she 's my sister ,
she 's just hard down mean .
she used to tear up my toys ,
and next up is mrs. ida parker .
excessive housework , or artsy hobbies .
so you saw mrs. nugent in april of this year ?
with your own eyes ?
i came to her house to get her to sign some documents .
just then , he takes the documents back and she sions them .
okay . it confirms a pattern .
well , it sounds like lloyd hornbuckle
oh , boy .
tell everyone for heaven 's sake ,
i don 't want her disturbing me ,
at this time , are there any suspects in the murder ?
hey , sheriff , did you actually find him yet ?
he wasn 't at carthage aviation ,
we 're gonna throw a net over the entire tri-county area
achieving goals , mastering skills ,
and if you 've worked hard ,
you can hold your head high ..
she had become so mean and possessive of me .
and then it just .... . happened .
i shot poor mrs. nugent four times .
then what ?
i know i done wrong and i must atone for my sins . oh !
and i 've known him for a little while ,
and you know that something at some point 's gotta give ,
if we ever get angry enough .
all he had to do was put her body
a woman like that with a bad heart
a few davs later , he 'd be doing her funeral .
there are not enough nice men in this town .
we don 't even think he did it .
dannv buck .
did you ever stop to think
maybe it was a forced confession .
he 's too sweet to stand up under interrogation .
he walked in , sat down and told us everything .
well , hell .
it 's not as bad as people say it is .
you know what ?
and no matter what the truth is ,
and right now , bernie needs to know ,
good to see you , thanks for coming .
god bless you for everything .
you got to at least take him off the prayer list .
neutral ?
you know , all i hear is poor bernie .
hell , everyone seems to be forgetting
the heck it isn 't .
although rumors have been circulating
he didn 't shoot mrs. nugent in the back .
bernhardt tiede ain 't no monster .
in fact . i don 't know
in the meantime , bernie sits in the county jail
now a lot of people use grated cheese ,
that keeps the flavor in .
that 's $ 14.74 .
if someone came along and shot you in the back four times ,
as far as convicting bernie ,
all the little old ladies ,
and i went all in .
and that 's usually because
so when i heard that the judge
let the jury be able to see
boys , make sure it opens up to the jury .
but , you know , this was the big stage
they projected pictures of frozen dead mrs. nugent .
and i saw
no further questions , your honor .
i don 't remember .
we were advised to by a lawyer .
you mean , just some old boy come in off the street ?
i guess he was working for us .
oh , you don 't think so .
but you told us earlier
is that the same woman that you have not spoken to in four years ?
i knew he 's in trouble when i saw that jury .
i mean , they got more tattoos than teeth
now . bernie .
yes. sir .
i loved her very much .
well , if you cared for her ,
i could probably describe it like being in prison
she was very jealous and possessive of my time .
i don 't even remember picking up the gun that day .
so why did you leave the body there ?
oh no , no , no .
that was never my intention .
and i was ..
did he burn down the house ?
he still knew he done wrong .
he just didn 't have the courage
and in the meantime he did a lot of good for a lot of people ,
thank you .
now look , everybody 's
an angel of death .
bernie tiede , please rise .
yes , sir , we have , your honor .
yes. sir .
bernie was a good man .
bernie had a great heart .
we need more bernies in this world .
very funny . okay , let 's get the patient up to ct ...
well , then leave and i 'll get shepherd .
you 'd risk your patient 's mobility for your pride ?
have you told anyone ?
which was apparently very wrong and i 'm sorry .
n-no . just , uh .. just .. we 're not there yet ,
i 'll just stick with " i 'm sorry . "
hey .
um , koracick . what are you doing here ?
i mean , really , deeply failing
okay . thanks . just go under .
okay .
i mean , it 's ... it 's everywhere .
okay . there we go .
and , boom . and there you go .
i can feel them pulsating off the walls , you know ?
she needs good energy .
well , he said that nothing 's official for a few hours .
by the time i asked permission , he could have been dead already .
get that wire out of that man 's body ,
does she think you did this ?
uh , it 's doom metal .
well , he 's right .
it was black
it 's important that i align myself
maybe , i should be making some changes .
no , there 's no need for drama .
i still love her .
i told you , i don 't do that shit any more .
so i think it 's high time that you got back in the saddle .
it 'll lift your spirits but not knock you out .
now is not the time to lose thy nerve ,
come , sir hung
he 's got learning disabilities .
ah , each band of heroes will complete
and as game master , i will be watching over all of this .
ah , gwen .
shut your mouth .
where the fuck are the keys ?
in this world , young jonen ,
where the fuck are the keys ?
they sing songs about the time that you gave ronny kwok 's
good times , man .
come on !
i mean , surely , you 're not still sore about
for old time 's sake , he 's in .
consider it done , my liege .
show-off
step forward when your group is called .
move it or you 'll be faced with a hex of great dark magic .
it 's a lot like you remember it , except for sitting around
this is the larp , not the wicker man wiccan cosplay .
tis in the book , dude .
um , eric .
stand back and witness the spectacle of my animation spell .

jobryeth takes a lethal strike to the back !

regeneration spell successful !
lightning bolt !
you know , those redneck paintball jerks who crashed
speakers of elvish ?
do i know you ?
was it the robes or the pointy ears that gave it away ?
oh , no .

if i didn 't know better , jobryeth , i 'd say you were
but you can 't tell anyone .
it 's too late .
to the nether rea ms .
all i 'm saying is we 'll be taken more seriously if we refer to
you guys sound like a bunch of little girls .
i tried to handle this in private , but if you wanna

you saw her without me .

although i have gazed upon thy visage before , tis only by the

i thought you was a musical people .
hitting the trailer park trifecta .
no one 's going anywhere .

one suit , black .
one pair of shoes .

you know i really i have to move .
now , i don 't want to have to check into your immigration status .
nothing .
the year of the db cooper hijacking .
the first number in the series of bills used in the ransom drop .
all it proves is you did the research .
so you 're married ?
michael , we 're both adults . put your cards on the table .
as one of the very few women around here ,
i 'm not used to enjoying it .

from now on , your shots , medical concerns ,
the questions you have about me .

something 's wrong . they shouldn 't be this far north .
reggie , we can 't go this way .
it 's beautiful .
i always imagined there was more out there ,
you didn 't believe me ?
and cute .
nah . takes a lot to rattle a turkey like me .
jake ? jake !
yeah , like i can 't stop thinking , hypothetically ..
no , but i can imagine a scenario in which i might .
very clever .
well , what if some fella ..
well , a reasonably attractive , quick-witted fella .
i would love to see it .
i could never leave the flock ,
what if everybody was safe and happy like before ?
that would be a dream come true .
what are you doing ?
the more you say that name , the dumber it sounds . i mean ...
okay .
i didn 't grow up on a nice free-range farm .
the most important thing for you to remember
i have a plan .
we destroy the weapons , we stop the feast .
exactly !

so , what 's your plan for getting in ?
it 's our only way out now !
come on !
i can 't give up .

exactly !
yeah ?
what does it mean ?
i bet he 's behind the door that this opens !
oh , come on !
i 'm the great turkey ?
which means jake was telling the truth the whole time !
i hate to say i told you so .
it wasn 't the great turkey . it was always reggie .
he brings blessings to all of you . honor him .
you 'll be in prison , but at least you 'll still be alive .
he 's far surpassed your capabilities .
we 'd have to settle a few things first , like a claim for damages .
shoot ! what the hell is this ?
what happened down here ? what 's going on in this place ?
tony , are you down here somewhere ?
any signs of life ? i 'm afraid not .
tron man is alive !
are you going to scold me , pepper ?
i don 't want to be the only adult in this relationship .
especially when they 're beautiful .
tony .
damn it . teams blue and gold , cover all escape routes !
it 's s.h.i.e.l.d. what did you do this time ? something awful , i imagine .
so , miss potts . is your boss free any time in the near future ?
of course . being tony stark , he never follows his schedule .
trying to tell your crazy boss about this ,
they herald the coming of the lightning , and perish as heralds
excellent . we have a deal , my friend .
what 's wrong ?
but i need some answers before you wipe ' em out
fine , go ahead .
i need to know about the men who hired you .
come on , stark ! you of all people
how can you drink this coffee ? it 's like sludge .
drinking it at night in the jungle used to calm me down .
tere 's the file . i found it .
his father had a lo of assets hidden around the world .
nowadays , a little cash can make the impossible possible .
looks to me like this kid has been burying his trail for a lot of years .
according to this , he 's involved in
what a surprise .
let me try something . what are you looking for ?
computer geeks are something else .
although i hear he 's not very good with a bow and arrow .
you have 40 minutes to complete the mission and get back to the ship .
i don 't get it . what would he know about a place like that ?
then someone bought the property and built a luxury hotel there
the and itself was apparently purchased by obadiah stane .
the wind ?
what happened to the server room ? i haven 't been able to get a response .
i 'm going to fix the computer so we can use it .
i 'm pretty sure i can survive for five minutes without this old heart of mine .
i can 't tell the situation from here . what do you want to do ?
hi there , " old man " tony !
here are clint and natasha
good , maria . now re-boot the howard .
to protect it from unauthorized users .
you talked in your sleep when you passed out at your desk .
the particle-beam cannon on the chinese military satellite is about to shoot !
i want to show this guy something i have that he doesn 't !
this is gonna be our last chance , so listen carefully !
how much time do we have ?
all right , jarvis , pull the trigger !
here we go ! hope your little nap didn 't affect your aim !
i was just expecting you 'd look much older .
you must know a little bit about my past . have a seat .
thought i caught a little bit of east texas in there .
well , mr. phillips , my aunt , barbara van poole ,
i remember pleasant meadows .
i used to call and speak with her regularly ,
well , you see , don 't typically do out-of-town jobs , so ..
how do you know you can trust me ?
i think it might be a good idea for you to get out of town for a few weeks .
w-what 's wrong with galveston ?
name your price , carson .
the road has always been a fascinating place for me .
there i was , back in texas .
a lot has happened since i left texas .
maybe i drank enough to finally face the shame of my past .
like everything too good to be true , it comes at a price .
well , i get by .
did you ever meet her when you were there ?
that was a while ago .
i don 't know .
now , would happy go to him to get drugs ?
nah , he would go to mitchell .
now , why are you asking me all these questions ?
didn 't like the look of the guy at the bar ,
lt was clear to me that he was a lot more involved
skipping the science lesson ,
well , that 's changed .
hired to do what ?
happy 's been blatantly cheating on her all over town .
or maybe more likely ,
maybe they made him the same deal they made me years ago .
you know what i think ?
i think it 's cleared my head up .
wanna do a shot ?
two .
he really was a great guy .
it 's black , isn 't it ?
did you get jealous every time he went home with his wife ?
look , everyone in this town doesn 't like you . why ?
no , no . they said that your husband poisoned everybody
let me show you something .
within a year , people started getting sick .
the reports were inconclusive .
well , that 's not your responsibility .
it is . why ?
wanted life to be easy for our daughter .
carson , she 's our daughter .
when i came to visit you before i married charlie .
well , you sure as hell weren 't ready for marriage and a baby !
come on !
she never had that look in her eye with charlie .
she said you were the love of her life .
she went out to visit you in los angeles just to make sure .
i 'm scared . don 't be .
that 's not why we 're here .
you 're telling me that after what that fuck did to us ,
yaakov , son of a bitch .
his father died during the war .
what is your current profession ?
it 's worse than that .
they say first they need something from us .
what ?
enough !
no , we have no idea what his signature looks like .
what else can you see on the outside ?
that must mean the on-site laundry 's on the other side of the hotel ,
you said we can 't make it across the hotel .
hotels use rooftop ventilation ,
put me on speaker .
go to 4 dunn place .
make her tell us where scylla is .
my only son .

i wanna make sure you guys are clear that we expect
one , if i 'm gonna .
get a few acres of land and raise some chickens
if the average civilian had been through
i want you to tell me the first thing that comes to your mind .
tell me what you see .
what about this one ?
all right , let 's try it again .
my kidneys were all tore up from it all over there ,
it says here you had a severe headache , and a crying spell .
it was brought on by a letter i received from a girl i knew once .
it was nostalgia that was brought on by a letter i received .
no , sir , not my sweetheart .
the kid sister of a friend of mine i knew from back home .
now , it wasn 't a vision .
well , tell me about the dream .
i need to know .
this will help in your treatment .
back home .
where do you get this idea about me ?
oh , my goodness . i think we do .
you were acting aggressive because you drank too much alcohol .
you told me you were an able-bodied seaman , and you were looking for work .
yeah , well , you have any ?
would you scrub yourself and make yourself clean .
come and join us .
they 'll still be there when you get back .
stand wherever you like .
what a day . what a day .
can you invite him over ?
can you say hi ?
you seem to inspire something in him .
freddie ouell .
i usually put some thought into them .
oh , well , yeah .
i don 't like to think about it . it makes me sick .
you know , i didn 't know which window was yours , and i always guess right .
that 's gonna be our time . that 's gonna be our time , right ?
i still find it difficult to see the proof
" ook through the telescope , " as my friend said .
you 've also said that these methods , cause methods ,
in being able to access past lives ,
you need to tell me so that i know .
nothing bad .
but this is not the way .
all right ? freddie ?
this is acting like an animal ,
allow that there may be color with unfamiliar tones ,
its particles of dust derive from un-modern constituents .
now , memory filters all of that out .
with such gratitude .
come home . you 're late .
no , sir . is that how your mother said it ?
we 're following right behind you .
i 'm fine . i love you !
your fear of capture and imprisonment
this is not you .
when i told freddie about your unpublished work
" how do we know who he is ? " is perhaps the question .
pick a spot over there , touch it , and describe it to me .
fine , fine . walk to this window over here .
it just feels like glass .
describe it . describe it the best you can .
right .
nothing . nothing . that 's what i feel , nothing .
so , if you could all move , except for you , freddie .
everyone .
open , storm ..
cold , out at night .
back again !
i just don 't understand it .
o not do that , please ?
wait till you get to the good parts .
well , as i 've begun , i did notice on page 13 there 's a change .
freddie , i have a matter of such urgency ,
i can cure you .
come to england . i 'll tell you .
" x " marks the spot where the sunken treasure is .
the captain never leaves the ship . i 'll get it .

there 's a human house ?
we stay away from humans .
tinker bell knows that , don 't you ?
grouchy .
no , the air . it smells .
tinker bell .
wel , of course , my darling .
yes , lizzy .
hmm . the truth hurts , doesn 't it ?
wow . these 'll be perfect for the new wagon prototype i 've been working on .
it 's a good thing we were walking or we might never have seen these .
the door got jammed .
then we better leave right away !
no , it looks like it 's gonna get stronger .
we can 't fly in the rain and the meadow 's already flooded .
big thingy , dead ahead !
i recognize that wagon . stay on this course !
i sure hope tink is all right .
a fairy could get used to this .
well , i 'm gonna remain optimistic .
we 're almost there .
did you feel that ? we 're moving faster .
i just have to find the road .
that road !
so , i guess we need to find a bridge .
it 's not deep we can walk across .
but you 're a garden fairy !
rosetta !
it 's squishy . oh ! what was that ?
i can get myself out of here .
i 'm sorry . i can 't feel my legs .
i 'm so sorry , lizzy .
you 're my best friend .
then i could helo the flowers bloom and talk to animals
where are we going ?
oh , my ! i 'm .... . i 'm flying !
look at me ! whee ! i 'm a fairy !
this is simply too much .
but i wasn 't having a tantrum !
if i tell you the truth you still won 't believe me .
i was flying . my fairy showed me how .
but it 's not nonsense . father . it 's the truth !
yes ! and i can prove it .
elizabeth . this is what you 've been doing ?
but father , these are facts !
why can 't you just believe me ?
father , wait !
no ! they 're real !
but father !
it 's a halfway house for the mentally and socially inept .
you 're out of your padded cell , but you haven 't really qualified
you might still be under the impression you can think for yourself
if you get a key to the tower , it means you 're getting better
this is the real crazy .
it 's disappearing into a dark corner where no one can reach you .
then we 've successfully eradicated two more identities . do you concur ?
get up . how do you feel ?
say " ah "
don 't you see you 're falling apart ?
this place is a dump .
no one is gonna take care of you .
why are you still here ?
got myself a new entry in the accident book .
bad hair day ?
this place is full of girls with daddy issues , and i 've got the penthouse suite .
in fact , i 'm thinking of trying out ..
could you give me some pointers ?
it 's good to see you , hogan .
did you know her ?
i don 't mind the weird stuff , but she 'd never take off the fucking bunny ears .
do you ever put it away ?
trying to keep everyone 's mind off suicide .
we 're all subject to the same risk assessment .
" brings undesirable personalities under control
most of ' em .
memory loss , seizures and incontinence . "
isn 't it time you went home ?
and leaves me to pick up the wet patches .
it 's gonna make you boring like everybody else .
thanks for the sugar .
don 't give in .
listen , i 'm coming there on friday to check on the module .
are you all right ?
relax , detective . it 's normal .
well , we were for an hour .
what was i thinking ?
every time i get close to someone ...
i 'm surprised you haven 't jumped yet .
i have gadgets .
hey , put those on . i rigged an antenna up on the roof .
distant number stations , backwards music channels ..
ooh , have a listen .
the yin and the yang
okay .
of trying to get incriminating evidence against alice , forget it .
it has nothing to do with her .
do you want me to come by in 10 minutes ?
i 'm borrowing this too .
and then that whack job pushed me down the stairs again .
she 's got a warped sense of humor .
this whole building 's full of fucking lunatics .
but what do i get ?
but if patient 99 's machine therapy had not failed
what makes you think your new machine will be any better than the last one ?
we all live with duality every day
hey , wake up .
relax , doc . i am following by the book .
getting quieter every day .
es , but that one can 't talk , remember ?
uh , the pipes . bad plumbing
and don 't get me started on the electric .
you plug yourself in , you let her out .
she 's turning it into something ... better .
what .. what are you doing ?
i want to meet the real you .
you 're undermining my process .
this is police work , silk . it 's not group therapy .
i 'll get more out of her in half an hour than you 'll get all night .
you need to listen to what she 's saying
after what happened to hogan , why take the risk ?
bit late for halloween , isn 't it ?
cleo .
cops were here .
what am i 6onna tell them ?
come on . i 'll take you home .
you don 't have anywhere else to go .
that is a confidential file , suki .
only we all call her alice .
what are you talking about ?
he said everyone he gets close to commits suicide .
when did she get loose ?
who 's patient number 99 ?
kind of the jealous type .
she was trying to warn me
it 's just alice doing what she does best ... pushing
sinclair , don 't you like this look for me ?
emergency . which service do you require ?
hogan ?
i was trying to help her .
she was bouncing around the room like a pinball .
and now it 's out here .
go be whoever you want to be .
i just hope that she 's me .
when you 're crazy ..
you watch them writing on walls ..
and the way you deal with this is you learn to enjoy
ou learn to read in reverse .
suki . suki , please don 't go .
this must be an important part .
to . alice !
i did this to you . it 's my fault . leave her alone .
i 'm sure he knew what he was doing .
the machine shows you who you are on the inside
and me ?
think about that on the way down .
had enough of the freak show already ?
oh , shit .
is that me ?
why wasn 't i like you ?
tedjo 's a cop killer .
he 'll make a mistake . i 'll get him .
but you 're out of time .

starving , clutching this pen knife till dawn .
it 's all i had . it got me through .

i became a man that night . that 's the point .
to teach them how to be a man .
i 'd tell you to stay in the car , but i figure ...

five dollars won 't even cover the interest you 're accruing .
don 't know , but my-interest rate in the conversation is zero .
that 's one of the first things my father taught me about finance .
max , i interned at merrill lynch .
i had nowhere to go . you took me in .

the man super glued hershey 's kisses to your nipples .
what is that ?
one of which is certainly the cause
what 's this word ?
you called me nancy for three years .
he even picked up the check .
although , when he was trying to figure out the tip ,
well , maybe , i mean , it seems kind of perfect .

yeah , it 's weird .
no , no , i-i 'm not jealous , i just think
you okay ?
of course i don 't want you to be unhappy ,

immediately .
disgrace .
her name is li li .
her fingers like the tender white roots of a green onion .
i didn 't do anything .

the central corridor leads directly to the control room .
a virus that is designed to spread through their entire network

just one of the many wonderful things about being me .
let 's give a superdome welcome to billy canady .
not yours .

hey .
i am . later .
i swear you 're fucking 6 inches fucking taller .
there you go , son .
my pleasure , mr. mcewen .
friends like you , who needs luck ?
all i needed was for her to enter your room .
picked up on your keystrokes .
.. and downloaded everything about the exr .
bult lit was not her fault .
i 'd been on him for a week . i was waiting for my chance .
you are so much better than watches , jess .
okay , no , no , no . when you came to my hotel , he had roughed you up .
she was stealing from him .
this is really fucking unbelievable .
do you hear me ? he is not gonna die .
you see , you shoot between the third and the fourth rib .
hold pressure on that . hold pressure on that .
that misses the heart and the major arteries .
there we go .
but next time a guy comes knocking for me ,
and what exactly are your intentions ?
come outside .
miss channing ? max , whoa , whoa , whoa , wait .
yeah , she used to be a billionaire ,
oh . okay .
no . she doesn 't try that hard .
oh , hi . i didn 't hear you knock .
and , young man , if you don 't swing by your store
yes !
oh , baby .
must have been a pretty hot date with the candy man .
earl , i got two amish in my booth .
so amish , huh ?
" ma 'am " ?
i always thought i 'd have to wait
we can 't drink coffee , ma 'am .
we can do whatever we want , jacob ,
i love the amish culture .
you salute the flags at ihop when we walk by .
max , question .
oh , no . it 's sixth grade all over again .
are we sure this is a good idea ?
he was practically raising a barn in his pants .
just a typical male reaction
rainbow , dollar sign , muffin . could be worse .
i wasn 't sure what it meant , but i immediately got tested .
all ready for my second date .
you know it .
you know , the one you like .
and if that place plus this outfit
oh , it 's not ? follow me , please .
bye , baby , mama 's going to get day-laid .

sheldon , are you sure you want to be bringing rai
i have a contractual obligation to provide amy with conversation
hey , there 's my beautiful bride !
oh , yeah ? that 's nice .
let 's talk about that for a minute .
how crazy is that ?
you can 't catch a computer virus .
what do you want , ma ?
bernadette and i are starting a life together and ..
ma ..
i 'll talk to bernadette .
i 'll just go sit in a hole in the ground
i 'm sure i can get bernie to come around
you listen to me , if you want to be a man ,
i can 't believe these people won the cold war .
fine .
not even a lousy postcard !
yeah , it 's fun , isn 't it ?
increase the flow on the pump .
helm , i said shut up .
pierce ?
i don 't know what i did .
sheldon , i understand
oh , look who 's in favor of compromise ,
she settled . there 's a difference .
what time do you and bernadette head out ?
we 're hoping to make it before dark .
you know , you 're right .
i need to stand up for myself .
and if he doesn 't like it , he can move back here .
well , who you gonna hit on ?
that 's your favorite .
hmm ? well , she spends her whole day scooping .
is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone ?
you are in for such a treat .
he spends all day making these
she texted she was coming .
sorry , i had to run across the bridge ,
i 'm at beak . i 'm trendy again !
it would get in the way of hearing
okay , they were my words .
oh , no , please don 't make a toast .
seriously , lenin .
you don 't need to reinvent the freaking wheel here .
you know what , i see if i have another klonopin .
it 's not for you .
should i go in there ?
i can 't take that sad look .
i 'm fine alone ; you didn 't have to leave .
plus , i don 't want to leave you .
i lost bone mass in there .
i 'm so embarrassed !
you got a stomach ache .
i 'm not used to rich anything .
uh , bird bones and pretentious people ...
oh , do you think so ?
he 's moving his whole life .
i hate to say this , but you need a mint .
i need to disappear .
max !
great , just in time to see me jump .
oh , i jumped on that bike so fast ,
okay , fine , we all heard it .
well , elizabeth was in much need of a companion .
she is entitled to live beneath this roof .
above or below her murray bloodline ?
will you refrain from shrieking . like the blessed french !
i had thought i should one day .
she is rather soft on the eye . i have thought no further of it , mama .
her sister-cousin has a rather fast tongue .
are we to hear you play tonight ?
before she renders herself sport to some ' gent ' of cruel promises .
that at least is true
sorry , i did not know youi ..
in some way , yes . miss lindsay .
if he should .... should want to paint me
next to elizabeth ?
quite . though one should be forgiven for thinking ..
papa ! may we do this in private ?
you may take the books back to the library .
her marriage portion and her inheritance at once .
mr. davinier , what is the purpose of the law , in your eyes ?
example ?
and you aspire to the judiciary ?
i wish to make the laws , for that is how i may truly change this world .
make it a better place .
a country lawyer you may make if you pay attention to what you are taught .
mr. cavinier .
quite a task .. to sit for so many hours .
i appear the only one to have just learned of the zong case .
why do you judge me so ?
mr. davinier , please .
tell me .
i can only tell you what i believe .
or they would not come under the insurance consideration .
that is why they were killed .
these ' matters ' have been for public consumption for months
and i will decide when she is ready for such realities
do so
i should be delighted , mr. oliver .
are you really to defy papa ?
until you .
oh ... it can do no harm .
although , if a desirable match were a possibility .
oh , they 've disappeared . people will think she has no family
he cannot overlook your mother 's origins as i do .
why should anyone even pay her regard .
with loveliness and privilege ?
as i do you .
really ?
and i should not call myself a gentleman .
but that would require a change in law .
it is the utter injustice .
nor i you , miss lindsay .
goodbye , miss lindsay .
miss lindsay ...
most evenings .
elizabeth is a determined spirit .
quite a task .
and since there is no male heir
femmiless ;
your brother needs a wife who can bring him more and
the 7th viscount stormont is a scoundrel
though , thankfully , her cousin is not .
james , you are my first boy .
be sympathetic to your brother . like the unfortunate miss murray
uh , i cannot offer you a title for the next lady ashford
is i can , without doubt .
and trust that this will be acceptable to you ...
my honor , if you would agree to become my wife .
elizabeth , a word of advice . wait for no man , dear .
dido ?
you have ensnared my brother .
oh , mr. james ,
have no further use for your impoverished cousin .
well , i doubt miss beresford has any more
than in an unwanted marriage in hampstead .
the ladies and miss murray are out calling , your lordship .
dear , dear bette .
i 'm not certain he is ready to go against the traders .
and yet , if he does . stand up .
the lord chief justice of england , then it may be impossible ..
that is a fact .
i was certain an announcement was to be made any day ...
and .
at the pleasure garden .
i wanted you to tell me .
i should have .
would choose the man i loved .
i am not in the habit of requiring an explanation more than twice ..
there is little point in repetition .
that is enough !
t 'hac 's correct
in a world where she may be worth more dead than alive .
by the very grace of god .
to share diminished water reserve amongst all those living , at best .
and in such emergency circumstances ..
my finding is that the slaves
they knew the risk since this fashion of transportation .
disease that rendered the zong slaves impossible to sell
to facilitate insurance compensation .
but then you were wrong .
after he begged you and cried .
alright , can we let our interns do their job now , please ?
mari prishna , 34 , seven days post-op
he saved jai .
no , mari , you caught the rope ,
uh , i 'm checking in my wife ... josephine karev .
you say goodbye there , she goes in on foot .
did what ?
you left me in a car
there were no bears . why ...
this is why we should wait to talk .
dr. grey 's bleeding heart got the better of her ,
did you bring an actual violin , counselor ?
dr. grey ,
why not just pay for the surgery yourself
out of nowhere .
of course i did , maggie .
i 'm trying to help .
she hung on so hard
and then we show up and we bring him back here
in california , we had a patient .
he didn 't wake up from surgery .
turns out it was fat embolism syndrome
i mean , owen and i haven 't exactly slapped a label on it ,
are people looking at us ?
no one 's looking at us .
wait . he left already . right ?
he took a leave of absence . he e-mailed all of us .
i mean , plastics is kind of scrambling , to be honest .
so , where 'd he go , anyway ?
it 's our new chief 's first day .
you don 't need to now .
hi , um , i-i have cancer fusion cells ,
this is all wrong .
oh , look at your navy blue scrubs .
sure .
yeah , great . we 'll talk about it during surgery .
then can you just point me to whoever 's in charge ?
yeah , i know , all right ?
tell them we 'll update them as soon as we know anything .
folks , we need this area clear .
i need an update on my son , kevin gailis .
yo , dude , a little help .
i made a judgment call .
am i seriously mad ? you know ...
i am seriously mad
we came to an or .
uh , well , there 's no obvious active bleeding .
yeah , i won 't keep you . i 'm just wondering
wasn 't asking you .
are you sure ? because you also tried to cram
deluca ?
this morning shift was down a couple nurses ,
i would tell you ,
yes , ma 'am . yeah .
he knows to look at the or staff report in the mornings , right ?
i don 't either , it turns out .
i 'm just gonna e-mail you stuff !
oh . well , if you want a change of pace ,
i 'm your research partner
it was one time , tom .
did my sister put you up to this ?
that 's a good thing , right ?
life surprises you .
what ?
i meant , uh , this conversation 's boring .
what ? is it something i said ?
the chest-blade kid is still in the or .
uh , the cops want a time-stamped copy
no , i trusted my gut . now , that 's not luck .
i 'm still not apologizing . you acted like an ass .
that 's satisfaction enough .
all right . time for another round of epi .
trying to access the femoral artery .
got it .
maybe , together , we make a butterfly .
we wanna give it a shot .
that way , you can go out tomorrow and relax .
so we 're exposed here .
that , son , is a tremendous load .
drop the gun , put scylla on the ground .
if you don 't ...
you can 't kill your mother , michael .
and i 'm no longer your son .
oh , come on ! you 're a superstar in the verge of free agency .
in the middle of an election year ?
what makes you think i can ?
well , carl 's putting together your itinerary .
but we 're about to present the budget to committee .
i 've been working on it .
and now you 're working on this .
patton said he 'd have traded his command for that ribbon .
now , why do you think
well , that 's a very good place to start .
he 's not a grunt . he 's air force .
who ? tully ?
you can learn a lot about these guys hanging with them .
and every day he finds the courage not to stick a gun in his mouth .
and believe me , i get a lot more than i give .
so i saw frank pitsenbarger .
for all the charlie company guys that you put together .
well ..
love to talk to your husband , too .
well , i don 't have a position or an opinion
you want to talk to jimmy , you gonna have to wait .
thank you .
yeah .
i come out here ,
i hear you went to see jimmy burr .
he kills things to release stress .
yeah , he 's got a bullet in his head still .
and if you have something that you ..
incoming !
tell him to drop it on top of ' em .
a life for a life .
there are worst things that can happen to a man
losing men ,
i 'm gonna go public with the story .
it was because of rabbit .
i used to take him everywhere .
he and mum used to have these rows about it .
i know he took rabbit away and hid it somewhere .
i was supposed to be going with her ,
he 's visiting his sister . she 's in the south of france , so ...
it 's been good actually .
i think i 'd got bogged down before but now i can see .
finished , delivered , everything .
so i just went back and stripped loads out .
i decide the ending .
i think so .
was discovered to have murdered his , own father .
a new coder wants to reboot the game for a new generation .
i know what you 're doing .
yeah ?
i want all three of them .
she thinks we just fell off the turnip truck .
she 's trying to play cupid .
when you first came back ...
i thought , " right . three weeks , he 's gone . "
why don 't you just eat it like usual ?
hm ? what 's that ?
something 's glowing in the spring !
did you see that , hawk ?
you 're much more gentle , though .
you came here to find a way to save your land , right ?
what you 've started is not meaningless .
i wanted to save the kingdom of liones too .
you , too ?
everyone , prepare to land .
this is
what is the meaning of this ?
was that supposed to happen ?
the demon clan !
there 's so many of them !
the resurrection day was supposed to be much later !
we have the great ooink with us !
the ceremony will have to wait .
for our most precious wish !
what is that ?
name yourself !
descendants of the goddess clan !
your dirty little souls will all be devoured by me ,
awaken , o great beast !
i 'll head to the top of craggy peak .
oh , a flying captain leftovers .
hot , hot !
we 're saved !
i will be your opponent now .
you 're going to play with me , right ?
that 's one down !
how can you still be alive with needles all though your body ?
you wanted a hug , right ?
the six knights of black .
yet , you 're so lawless , even the demon lord abandoned you .
you bastard !
my skills have surpassed that of the ten commandments !
are you finished ?
how dare you hurt our friends !
won 't move ..
you 're up to no good , aren 't you ?
how could the captain lose ?
he 'll be okay , right , merlin ?
but this sword appears to be quite dangerous .
this is due to the hidden power of the winged sword .
this sword can only be handled by the head warrior .
solaad ..
father !
you are all right ?
what about your injury ?
it 's said they even prey on the demon clan .
the time of ruin .
we 'd better revive the captain real quick and stop that monster .
you must not pull out that sword .
he is a demon ! a high-ranked one at that !
a demon was pretending to be solaad ?
master zoria ....
for 3,000 years , the winged sword has been passed down so that we can fight
countless lives have been lost in these battles .
do something , granny !
master zoria , the beast is headed this way !
i will follow suit !
the desire to protect people has nothing to do with laws .
it 's a bit late in the afternoon , but i still have plenty of power left .
i wanted to observe this exchange a bit longer , but
you can leave it to us !
you guys protect the women and children in the plaza !
you can die alongside the celestials !
no , the plaza !
we can 't let it get near the plaza !
new spirit spear chastiefol . second form .
fillet and roast !
you 're in the way !
master zoria , the seven deadly sins are battling the indura .
you too ...
i don 't deny that i was a coward .
i have paralyzed his sight .
you 're different from what i 've heard .
thank you for protecting this village while i was away !
after we get rid of that beast .
hey . you know what might be fun ?
vern , i worked the catwalks in milan and paris .
you can 't afford not to .
what did she mean by " you can 't afford not to " ?
what do you mean ?
did i ever get violent ?
look , i 'm serious .
oh , that was a collection i was taking up for the children 's hospital .
did you donate the photos , too ?
what exactly is it you 're accusing me of ?
i 'm taking her dinner up .
no , i 'd rather do it myself .
oh , well , i 'll let her know you 're coming .
i was ... thirsty .
does no one in this house ever bother to knock ?
let 's go .
he doesn 't want you to hear the truth ...
what ?
how he broke her heart .. and mine .
you shut up , mother .
i thought that was harvey bigsby 's mistress .
future generations depend on men like him ,
when i first encountered haskell moore 's writing ,
i 'm only willing to conceive that he makes a compelling case

let 's get a good night 's sleep .
it 's gonna be great .
see you tomorrow night .
they found syringes and antifreeze at your house .
but felicia was at my house when i was making paul 's food .
any way to prove it ?
believe me now ?
his name is chuck , he 's a detective ,
you sound surprised .
oh , who am i kidding ? i love it . bree ..
you say that about everyone . you said that about tom scavo .
but as far as detective hottie goes ,
i 'm sure it was . i never forget a gay face .
chuck was married for 18 years .
failed marriage . let 's connect those dots .
he 's a cop . if 's a very masculine culture ,
you will know everything there is to know about a firearm
ms. solis ,
protection . why a gun ?
well , for one , if you leave a gun in the house ,
but felicia 's gone . you 're safe now .
it 's just time for me to go .
you belong here .
well , that 's not true . when i first moved here ,
we had to be nice . we came here running away
and it did .
that was a long time ago .
i con 't talk about this here .
i did love pete crowley like a brother .
at least i did ...
your partner and your wife ?
i 'm a detective . i 'm supposed to notice things .
part of me thinks she 's dragging it out
so you 're really not gay ?
fabulous .
brandon to the service deli .
this is why kids shouldn 't play with cans .
you sound surprised to see him .
pretty damn good .
it 's a mess out there . it 's pouring .
god . it 's like you 're not even trying .
from where i sit , you 're not .
felicia 's right .
the man you think i am ...
but i want to be that man again .
i have a confession to make .
taking control of our fears ..
but the danger of a sense of security is
one clear , moonlit evening ,
the tangy salad ...
but the most memorable part of the evening ...
in the year since she had left the lane .
the laughter of happy children .
you go first . just don 't use all the hot water .
so .. the kids are gonna want dinner .
fine .
yeah . still do .
would you believe that ? i told you she was mad . she 's mad .
we didn 't mean to hurt your feelings .
it 's just .... to be away so long and be totally ignored ...
who wants coffee ?
it 's doug , my ex . third time this week .
will i say yes ? well ... . depends .
aw . you guys don 't have to go to all that trouble . whose house ?
if 's an old-fashioned progressive dinner .
uh , salad at mine .
arthur ?
tear it up . we can do better .
that 's the good thing about a small town .
okay , so you 're a liar .
you were in las colinas stirring things up again .
don 't come near me !
i 'm not the little girl
as long as my mother 's dead .
you go . i should probably get to the office
this is about doing something nice for susan .
why the hell do you have a gun ?
what ? i thought he was dead .
what did that bastard want ? did he lay a hand on you ?
but in your case , i 'll make an exception .
oh , good . the gays are here . let the fawning begin .
it 's good to see you holding up so well .
oh , your ex-husband getting remarried .
which you obviously do not watch .
we thought you knew .
that 's why he was calling me . he 's getting married .
forks ?
the recipe called for mandarin oranges .
yesterday , and i went and got them myself .
but ...
it 's in the closet .
i 'll get the forks .
aw , thanks , karen .
you tell it .
you don 't have to tell it .
excuse me .
what are you doing with this guy ?
then , when ...
i suddenly realized what i had been feeling
hello , everyone .
my oven malfunctioned .
but , uh , chuck and i
i 'll bet it was .
well , as bree 's already pointed out ,
so i , um , i used my shirt , and ...
vigorously that , um ,
mike and i just wanna thank you guys
and , lynette , you and tom make a great salad ,
which was the perfect tribute to me .
oh , it 's gonna snow , trust me .
all right , so what 's the plan ?
you 're so white , i 'm worried we 're gonna lose you .
opening my balcony doors and watching it fall
the only snow angels you 'll see this year
i just got an email
they 're doing neighborhoods now ?
the producers are on their way over
okay , you have to stop saying that .
she 's gained 25 pounds in one year .
max , we all have to look our best , " cause ready ?

so now , i 'm looking up handicapped animals
i got your handicapped animal .
let 's not get personal , we all want this to work .
okay , you tell me ,
wow , show business is rough .
last time i checked .
she really loves him and wants this to work out .
i still have to feed him and take care of him
so it 's not gonna work out , girls .
come on , let 's go .
and , yes , we may have seen better days ,
it 's not to your liking ? sorry .

so do i .
and , uh , ooh , aldactone for hypertension .

i wouldn 't know .
three andrew jacksons say i , uh , run this table .
what does that mean ?
but , uh , that would be robbing peter to pay paul .
what kind of a big , beautiful beast of a car is this ?
i think she 's lonely . i think she wants us to take her out .
this car belongs to the jargoniew brothers .
he 's looking for , what is known in french ,
irena fell down the stairs .

well , we won 't pay ya .
wendy .
i guess .
go easy on him , girls .
he would pump it up on a vacuum cleaner .
he said , every day he would just ..
i mean why do you put your dick in it .
there 's other ways .
they put bees in it .
who knew you were a freak in bed .
i don 't feel that great .
i-i never went out on my wife before ,
you don 't get over that in five minutes .
the cops are not following us .
if he slows down , he may fall asleep .
come on , she 's got no clothes on . give her your pants .
no , i 'm not gonna give her my pants .
my pants are important to me . gimme , give , come on .
you don 't need pants . you sit in the car driving . what the ..
i don 't need pants ?
i 'm not giving her my fucking pants ! end of story .
i 'm not making any offers .
song , how 're you doing ? do you sell women 's clothing here ?
my friend just asked you a question , a polite question .
you no hear so good , old man , or you just stupid ?
how 's everybody doing over here ?
doc , i didn 't know you had so many friends .
well , let me know if i can get you anything else .
anyway , i passed out for a while , and um

we stole the car on rodney street ,
what , you 're gonna fuck ' em up with a pair of pliers ?
holy shit . who are you guys ?
oh , my baby , i 've missed you .

i don 't understand the question .
it 's true , but i know ya , at the same time .
they 're fuckin ' animals .
" the nutcracker " was my favorite .
i got blood all over my jacket .

i wonder about him the most .
what do you , uh , what do you imagine he 's like ?
see how far " please " gets you !
why ?
just give him a few more years . what 's the difference ?
give me back the dress .
you can 't force me to take off this dress .
in three seconds , your eyeballs will be on fire .
edie ?
i can 't see what i 'm doing here .
maybe i should watch so that if it breaks again , i can fix it .
so that the flap works .
i 'm guessing he passed out from the pain .
a ruptured disc is very serious .
oh , my god.how many did you take ?

i set her up in a nice house , i gave her an allowance ...
she was always there when i needed her , but if she needed me , well ..

i 've known you for two weeks , and this is the first glimpse of a guy i could actually like .
a guy who can admit he screwed up ,

when the baby is born ,
you don 't mind being stuck with a baby all day ?
my mother , for one .
look , roy may be too proud to send flowers himself ,

roy went through this when his first wife died .
gaby , i 'm begging you .

i 'm just high on baby .
uh , in the kitchen .
oh , well , that 's why i 'm doing this .

i 'm such a muddle head .
if 's one of the good things about being in a wheelchair .
he was going to arrest you .
everything i did , bree , was to protect you .

well , i 'm sorry it went that far .
but why would you want to turn them against me ?

that 's how much i love you .
bree .

you were only pursuing your own selfish desires .
you took advantage of me
bree , don 't go ! you 're everything to me !
i mean , she is a great mom .
now we 're gettin ' somewhere .
you are nowhere near that .
i 'm separated ,
meanwhile , susan 's getting everything she wants .

with your son ,
she always complains that she has to do everything herself .
and she was fine at first .

can you describe the contents of the case ?
maybe a purple powder . i don 't know . it looks gross .
a job ?

brains in formation of only a few milligrams .
it acts more as a reflex .
animal life on earth goes back millions of years .
but it isn 't until we reached human beings at the top of the animal chain

in particular , this allows it
and this is the crucial part of our philosophical reflection we have today .
lucy .
nothing . just a little horizontal slit .
i 'm not in the mood .

afraid not .
did he do something awful ?
can you stay for some tea ? it 's been so long .
yes . yes , we do .
because i thought you 'd want to know .
so you could do something .
that i know nothing about the man i 've lived with for 27 years ?
i didn 't know .
but thank you for painting so vivid ,
you 'd want to know .
then i owe you an apology ,
what is ?
how the hell did he do that ? !

i don 't know , buddy .
probably gonna be out the rest of the season .
hey , but you know what ? that was one heck of a hit .
and now he 's in witness protection for life .
he said it was because he thought it was the right thing to do .
i don 't know .
what you 're telling me is if ..

you know , the big event .
since pronzo was the only one not in his office ,
thing is , sometimes it takes weeks for the marshals service to set up a new identity ,
i called the phone company said i was pronzo and i 'd lost my bill .
mrs pronzo was receiving dozens of calls from an area code a long way from chicago .
well , i 'll give you some quid pro quo .

yeah , you should be careful with who visits you in here , fish .
" in the race toward worldwide peace and prosperity.america will set the pace . "

i don 't think it 's a good idea .
if you want to save the tree house , why don 't you let me run instead ?
i 'm sorry , i didn 't catch that .

do we get to make our own choices or do we let the taste police
no , this is about personal freedom .
hey .
so i was hoping you could help me .
i would love to , but ...
i just wanted to know if she was happy .
well ,

oh , look , they have water aerobics .
you should sign up .
i mean , for the baby 's sake . how can i support it without a degree ?
can 't you just say that you like having me around ?
hi . what 's going on ?
so here 's the deal .
oh , i don 't think i like where this is going .
from thinking about me , what ?
wait , wait , wait .
i don 't want you to .
how do you know how to do that ?
you 've ruined me , you know that ?
god , you have the most luscious pussy in all of christendom .
remember , you 're not looking for merit .
we seek only imperfection .
tell me what you see .
in the classical world , it is the warrior ,
because there is only a man of god , not a man of gods .
there is no other god
the stones themselves have their own view of things .
they were piped up out of the earth in a time before any witness was .
let me show you .

to enhance the beauty of the beloved ..
we announce to the darkness
he was taking it rather poorly , i have to say .
maybe they have more practice at it .

you 're not the straight dude people think though , are you ?
i don 't mean the caper , i mean you . women like you .
do you know what they like about you ?
right !
the paradox .
you 're shitting me .
it 's just that there 's no easy way to turn the thing off , or reason to .
all right , i 'm in . and thanks .
i won 't say , " i hope you know what you 're doing " because you don 't .
you keep telling yourself it 's not as bad as it appears ..
increasingly .
this will dry up , right ?
that 's the thing reiner doesn 't seem to get .
that wouldn 't include the present one , would it ?
no reason . sorry
you want to know why jesus wasn 't born in mexico ?

200 . yeah .
that 's not a speed .
you 're telling me he was going 206 miles an hour ? in what ?

i might . oh , yeah ?
sure . same as you . greed .
i tried to appeal to your greed two years ago .
it 's too late .
they just don 't know how stupid .
maybe it is .

greed really takes you to the edge , doesn 't it ?
when the axe comes through the door ..
that 's fair enough .
they try to sell it at auction maybe , maybe not .
hey , welcome to america . huh ?
there is no one to talk to .
i have no suggestions , counselor .
we 're meeting now .

you said i 'm not using my space , so ...
okay , you need to move now .
you can 't stay there forever .
give up , wolowitz .
there is nothing you could possibly do to .
because you 're a pillar of health .
doesn 't the wine make the cow drunk ?
gloria !
you know she 's not here , right ?
she 's having her hair blown out .
that i pay for ?
then i get mad and tell her to hurry .
so i promised myself , no matter how late she is ,
just now , in the restroom down the hall . he turned around and
yeah , baby . i wish you 'd met her .
because it 's depressing . you don 't wanna go .
no , grandpa palmer 's dead to me . that 's like a figure of speech .
he 's gentle , like mom used to be .
snakes are your constant , but st. patrick , not st. francis
were you there ?
maybe you 're right .
you 're standing in one of the last great cathedrals in this country ..
for the consequences of your actions .

people wouldn 't sit near him in church .
i can 't say , " best . "
him knowing would just complicate things .
in order to move on , and we did
that it was fine with me when you left to go to that goddamn concert
that you 're the only one who 's gonna get hurt when you run away again ..

you 've altered your route ..
and he 's in a ravine with his kidneys ruptured and his back broken
so you 're telling this court .
a man you released .
on the worst day of your life .
i watched him cry right there .
i wanted someone to help him ...
if he lost his way .
that someone . is that so mulch to ask ?
i have memories .
you , me .
how come ?
i looked at you and i saw him .
last question : this man 's been your bailiff for 22 years . what is his name ?

i am therefore sentencing you to serve four years in state prison .
deputy , please take judge palmer into custody .

well , that is one of my degrees .
well , i 'm an actress .
what do you mean why ?
yeah , i don 't know what that means .

it 's too late for me .
she was right , you know .
oh , yeah , there she is . hi , mom .

i 'm talking about mercy , tyler .
we 're talking about a kid , gaspar .
with a price tag of ten million on his head .
you 're a mercenary , right , tyler ?
aren 't you sick of this life ?
my name is captain klenzendorf .
captain k .
this is frilein rahm .
so a little about me . who am i ?
oh , yes , that 's a wonderful idea .
will someone get this kid a gun ?
get in line , kid .
okay , here 's the situation .
but then you 'll tell on me and my mother ,
and if i tell my mother i know ,
it 's just a normal stalemate .
oh , god , you 're right .
it 's weird now , isn 't it ?
none of this should be weird .
ja , i was just keeping your bed warm for you .
do you know where your mother is ?
has she been spending much time at home ?
is she ?
my mother was chechen .

we have to go .

my brother florien has an apartment that 's being renovated .
issa , he says the bank will honor your claim .

youl 've crossed the line .
i don 't care what you do to me .
come , sit with me .
there are people out there who want to arrest him .
we 're concerned that they will find him before we do .
we want to help him .
we 're your solution .
you needed someone to take it out of your hands
your choice is between us
he just doesn 't want it .
we make that kind of mistake .
your agents and contacts were compromised .
and all that damage
you ever ask yourself that question ?
mmm-hmm , sometimes .
and what is it ?
isn 't that enough ?
just because you 're russian ,
where did this money come from ?
you 're an honorable man , i believe that .
we must trust each other surely .
it belongs to a man who has done great evil .
i wish to be free of him .
the sins of my father .
i believe you feel lost ,
only then will you be truly free of this burden .
wonderful .
we 've checked every name on the charity list .
herr bachmann , please .
we stay on the streets .
our sources don 't come to us , we find them .
their brothers , their fathers ,
it takes a minnow to catch a barracuda
i 've let my emotions get the best of me .
crazy .
well , that 's over .
when we see each other on the street ,
i just want things to be normal again .
if you throw a party , invite me .
sunday around 11 : 00 ? i 'll bring a quiche .
aren 't you glad i 'm not crazy anymore ?
we are over , karl .
oh , come on , bree . you 're gonna dump me over a lousy brooch ?
what kind of man does that ?
but how could you be so stupid as to then give it to me ?
hey , when susie and i divorced , she lost a lot of things
well , i am not proud of that .
well , not anymore . we 're done .
bree ...
you sure you know what you 're doing
hey , your phone . oh !

yes , you can , and i 'm gonna help you .
well .. wait ! wait !
why is he making you dinner at our house ?

but i thought you said it was in the master bath .
come on . this way .
well , they 're supposed to make an awful sound .
really , susan .
oh , please . look at this place .
so i lit a few candles and sprinkled some rose petals .
really ? mm .
because it is a required course that i will never use ,
you 're failing ?
i know . that 's why i did this ,
no ..
my advisor warned me that learning a language at my age
lynette , you gotta understand , i am drowning heres
you 're having trouble in school ? talk to me .
i 'm never gonna use it .
what if the kids found out ?
the same one you 're setting .
why ?
we also know something that we 've never told the kids ..
i cheated on a test .
we just finished gym class . now it 's time for reading .
hey. who 's the teacher here , huh ?
oh , ma , please , don 't cry .
he 's good .

you should have seen howard
when he was a little boy , every couple months ,
i know .
hey , stuart .
we were looking for a recommendation about comic books .
no , we were just wondering
um , a little bit of everything .

well , uh , let 's see .
ooh , thor !

a buddhist ?
i don 't want it to be one more film
oops !
hey . shit in my pants ,
how about this ?
but the little farming village he came from was called
and his daughters weren 't there any more .
you see where i 'm going with this , right ?
and he 's got a big bomb with him
and , like i said , there 's no way
yeah . but it 's not what i wanna really be writing about any more .
you ! you 're there ,
lightning .
it 's kaya . she 's come to say sorry to you , and she loves you ,
" kaya ! kaya ! "
" fuck you , you cunts ! "
yeah ..
she fought good , but she 's the next to croak .

but his rabbit gets away , though ,
worse .
the thought of sending her away ...
this is why i need someone

l promise . i 'll try .
your mother was just about your age when that was taken .
yes , she was .
i want us to make a new beginning .
father won 't believe someone broke in . you 'll only make things worse .

arcadia ?
very highbrow . no reason why you should have heard of it .
what can you remember of him from cambridge ?
no , not at all . go ahead .
no one 's mentioned the cambridge connection between us in all these years .
it was the summer revue . i can 't even remember what it was called .

but that is you standing behind him , isn 't it ?
and i do believe i 'm on the point of issuing a stern warning to him
if so , i would prefer it if i weren 't named .
no , if you don 't mind , let 's not return to cambridge .

tn other news .
i ... can 't read this story because i know that it 's not true
well , that was quick . did you get properly fed ?
sure . we 'll see .
i just need my agent to call me back .
and we may disagree on what is considered fascinating .
why do you have mostly-used toilet paper rolls in the cabinet in your bathroom ?
there on the end .
you 'll be a very rich man .
i want to talk about it now !
well , that 's not unusual , our grandmother and grandfather were first cousins .
here , jersey girl .
so , you still have a balance , miss israel .
but she 's really sick and she 's very old .
didn 't you people take a hippocratic oath ?
god . wow .
all right , i have $ 14 .
no , we need half the balance .
okay . just these .
i don 't want the others .
i just don 't want to carry them around anymore .
i told you i don 't want the others .
you know , you don 't have to be so disrespectful .
just get it to me soon .
uh , hey , in the meantime ,
good afternoon , darling .

lee israel ?
last time i saw you ... thank you .
am i right ?
you 're friends with , um , julia some ..
yeah .
so , what do you think ?
i could give you $ 75 .
it 's a bit bland is all .
well , do you think you could pay in cash ?
i 'm glad to hear you 're writing another book .
did you hear tom clancy is getting paid three million dollars
i mean , the p.s. makes it priceless .
so , one of each , twice a day , in her food .
it 'll stabilize her .
oh , no , no , no .
yeah , it 's awful . i mean , there 's dead flies everywhere .
thanks .
i fear i must decline your invitation as this weekend
welcome .
i 'm aware that you sell memorabilia and first editions .
yes , all of that .
wondering if these might be of interest to you ?
my cousin was a collector .
you clearly don 't know me very well .
come on ! spill the beans !
i have no one to tell . all my friends are dead .
i can 't fathom what criminal activity you could possibly involve in ,
libraries ?
how much are you getting for them ?
it 's a waste of a secret .
who else have you told about this ?
no . i remember you had someone .
why ?
unlike you , i prefer to put my money to good use .
i just thought we should do something .
" baby won 't you say you love me "
but if you are tempted , make sure you do your homework .
some care more than others about getting the real thing .
that one .
you run your mouth too much .
too much .
let 's go to your place . come on .
oh ! it smells horrible .
what 's going on in there ?
miss israel .
thank you for those cookies .
ms. israel .
so , what do you got ?
she had quite the mouth .
liked the ladies , too , i heard .
i assume so .
and people love this stuff .
that is fucking old . what 's that in cat years ?
ms. israel , i was wondering if you could come in tomorrow ?
please come in or call as soon as you can .
thank you . thank you for bringing it in .
what seems to be the problem ?
and he said that ..
it was illegal in those days , and ...
i 'm shocked .
you mean , your cousin ?
i 'm not gonna do that to you . i 'm a good guy .
i 'll lie .
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
that 's very generous of you .
you 're a clever woman .
oh , hello , welcome .
my grandmother just died , and .
and i discovered these when i was going through her closet and
oh , yes .
i guess i 'm not really up on all these things .
do you think it 's real ?
good .
you brought it back , right ?
you left it there ?
stop calling me an idiot .
i 'm just gonna kill myself first .
lee , come on . we can 't stop now .
maybe you could steal more real ones
fair enough .
i 'm a very private person .
you 're right ! that 's a great idea .
i 'll take the apartment upstairs .
if you catch my drift .
i 'm sorry , that really is how it works .
you tell me the truth , what do we get ?
you get to choose between a mountain bike or a ps3 .
please , you look cute .
i think you look fantastic .
oh , yeah , be careful .
he 's upstairs at alicia 's .
he said he 'd help me set up my printer , but i guess i can wait .
in what i can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me ,
hmm , typical .
they never went upstairs to visit the former tenants ,
oh , great ! now , i have to start all over again .
cool. so are you in a loft now ?
purely platonic. she 's also my maid .
i won 't lie. it 's pretty dope .
hey , i just wanted to bring you a little housewarming gift .
come on in. let 's open it. great .
oh , this ? i 'm dressed like a slob today .
i 've never had such good-looking technical support .
that is so awesome .
yeah , i know , tell me about it .
that 's why i work at the cheesecake factory .
alicia , what do you want as your default setting for dvds
well , dts has more low end , so ..
i don 't care .
you know , penny , there 's something that
when this happens ,
that i 'm like the old queen of the hive and it 's just time for me to go ?
they 're on the discovery channel .
bees .
gee , penny , thanks for buying us dinner .
even though the menu description specifies shredded ? yes .
you stop at the korean grocery and get the good hot mustard ?
did you pick up the low-sodium soy sauce from the market ? yes .
see how it 's done , leonard ?
no , no , pms is different .
i just got a callback to audition
but my car is in the shop .
i 'll run lines with you in the car .
and afterward , il 'll take you all out for chinese .
yum. starving .
they 're gone , penny . they can 't hear you .
i mean , anything she wants , they go panting after her like trained dogs .
you once had leonard and me get your television from your ex-boyfriend .
as a nation , we shared their agony .
it 's time !
all right now .
should we come back later ?
oh , please . it 's all right . it 's your day .
we 're good .
so in recognition of that ,
1e can ' . but he dd
i just wanted to say that
that 's a debt i 'll never be able to repay .
shut up .
you two have a very simple task .
he threatened to kill my family .
okay ? people that i need to protect .
katniss , what were you thinking ?
it 's appalling
i 'm the head game-maker . fun is my job .
seneca decided to quit breathing .
being head game-maker has never been
same reason as you . i volunteered .
ambition .
well , maybe it was you who inspired me to come back .
katniss , come . the president awaits .
two young people who embody our ideals
your love has inspired us .
look at them .
she 's not a leader
and she has to be eliminated .
at the right time .
katniss everdeen is a symbol . their mocking-jay .
then we let the people do the rest .
ghut down the black markets .
who 's gonna be there ? fear .
show them that she is one of us now
we need to talk
if we leave right now ,
you 've given them an opportunity .
there 's already talk in the mines . people wanna fight .
they will kill us .
get out of my way !
how about i shoot both of you ?
trust me , i 'm trying to help you .
you could live 100 lifetimes and never deserve that boy .
nobody decent ever wins the games .
there 's no winners .
we have to do whatever it takes to save him .
a guy like that has to know she 's not gonna make it .
well , katniss , i just hope when she goes , she goes quickly .
how 'd we get here , huh ?
i mean , who cares about them , right ?
well , if we see something sweet , we better grab it .
any secrets worth my time ?
everybody always seems to know my secrets
i 'm sorry you had to cancel your wedding
hmm . he 'll have to get in line .
no waving and smiling , this time .
that should be easy .
friction generates heat .
you should move your hands downward
thank you .
fplutarch ?
thank you for being here tonight
and we will never see anything like it again .
tonight will be their final opportunity
oh , don 't go crying on me now , caesar .
you know i wouldn 't believe you , even if you did .
but , katniss ,
aren 't we , folks ?
yes , president snow thought everyone would want to see it .
was he not , folks ?
don 't you love it , folks ?
well , actually , we got married .
a secret wedding ?
we.we want oulr love to be eternal
and i wouldn 't have any regrets at all
all right . this is news ! let 's find out more .

the force field .
we couldn 't find any signs of fresh water .
we 'll be safe with our backs protected . we should set up camp .
not a chance .
the hour 's gone . the hour 's up . it 's all right .
no , no . prim 's okay .
prim ! tind prim !
are you okay ?
okay ? they won 't touch prim . all right ?
if they tortured her or did anything to her ,
what if we . what if we set your backyard on fire ?
here 's what i propose .
that should draw them back to the beach .
anyone in the water or on the damp sand
because i invented it .
well , it 's better than hunting them down .
if it fails , no harm done anyway , right ?
i think we need to go .
i think so , too .
i don 't want to be the one that shoots first .
they 're not gonna make that same mistake again .
and it 's gonna be one of us .
moves and counter-moves
let 's get started .
we don 't want to be anywhere in the vicinity when this hits .
then head to the tree at the 2 : 00 sector .
i 'm gonna go with them as a guard .
and the tree .
there are two careers out there . i need two guards .
why can 't tinnick and johanna stay with you
it 's his plan . we all agreed to it .
thank god he 's keeping quiet .
you with that ginger ale of yours , pretending it was champagne .
could 've been a shoulder to lean on ,
the day of judgment is coming , brother .
slice and dice . show him we nasty .
come on .
i only ask that they give me a second chance .
why should we think this time is different ?
is two-face gone for good ?
a rusty trap .
come in here where it 's warm , mommy .
i need you , mommy . talk soft and make me feel safe
dog-eat-dog world , i guess .

i don 't believe this . it 's not in their car .
and right now , i 'm the only one
commissioner , something you have to see .
he set it back up ?
at east a dozen . then why ?
the guy 's a fascist . no regard for civil rights .
it 's like all that marching we did never happened .
give me another hit of that , will you ?
you made sure , the doors are locked , right ?
not letting anyone see him .
what did he do to himself ? you don 't suppose he
i wouldn 't rule out that he 's hurting himself .
we still talking about dent ?
it 's bigger than that now
they 're next on my list . but first things first .
the gotham life building .
look at me and have your laugh .
nothing can change what i am .
i think it 's a mistake to
batman ? i think he 's a-okay . he 's kicking all the right butts .
i 'd ike to see him show up for my landlord next .
we have to show patience .
one moment , i 've just been handed this .
do like we said . you got one hour .
hold your breath . once we get the ransom ,
chill , spot . it 's just a bat .
should have got out of the way , spot .
my men , my country , that 's all i cared about .
my wife
you sent them enough firepower to stage a small war .
leader says everyone , so get in .
not talking speeches , man . talking war .
they don 't even wait for an order .
bubber bullets
it 's just a shell to keep you safe ?
captain yindel stands firmly against the batman

but the war goes on .
your training begins tomorrow

chegs pre-school mutant .
yeah , right . you leader 's squeeze , i figure .
but you 're welcome to wait here .

truth is , you 've been a hero of mine since i was a kid .
make it sound like we leapt to our feet
rumors were flying , we barely had an army .
commissioner , you better see this .
you 're done for tonight . how do you know it worked ?
no , i think you do understand , matt .
matt , if your wife dies ,
age like anyone else .
sent to a mental institution for the rest of his life .
that 's why you killed them .
so they knew they had to die .
that was ... that was hard enough .
what are you gonna do ?
or you want to kill your wife to save the child ?
oh , yeah . guilty .
i think a little bit is ok , honey .

i 'm afraid
no , no , no , hey , ho .
i didn 't know we had a favorite place .
look , ethan , we don 't need to do this , all right ?
that 's why i transferred back here to faris .
i don 't need you to explain any of this , all right ? it 's not a big deal .
hugh , i want you to meet ethan .
the bike 's going with me .

we believe he was at the hotel that day ,
ihow come no one 's told me about this before ?
wow . you make me feel so special .

i 'm just waiting for you .
i 've always been loyal . please .
sit down . i also have a pretty teenage daughter .
cut their hair , paint it red , you know ?
to . never
it felt like the harder it was to come back
would you still care about me if i did horrible things ?
absolutely .
well , you know , sometimes that 's easier than telling the truth .
so you like to score ?
no ! well , i ... i .. i mean on the field .
on the field only , yeah .
school .
no , you 're not .
ok , see you later , mr. zooey .
you don 't like hugh ?
you know , a lot of my friends ' dads are in sales , ethan ,
i 'm saying they wear suits . that 's what they wear to work .
i gave him to you yesterday .
and now you 're back . i thought you were a pro .
is it my fault if your daughter is out of control
cause you should have been dead a long time ago .
i can 't promise , but i 'll make an effort .
i can 't get around your mirror .
she has chosen carefully .
hey , how did it go ?
of course i love her . i mean , i love her the same way ..
good morning .
you 're not on the couch . ho , tina , i 'm not on the couch
bring that orange juice right here .
that kid 's gonna be roasting his own beans for a long time ,
you have thanked us enough with that big bag of deer meat .
can you see this ?
i knew it .
weddings are where you meet girls .
well , we better be going .
have a great spa day .
we 're just going to the club , taking a steam ,
sometimes they do a strawberry-basil mix .
okay .
maybe i 'll grab a coffee with you , if you don 't mind .
the more i talk to people ,
excuse me , miss ?
where you put down that monk-brewed belgian wheat beer
you have to see this .
i have to kiss you now .
what was the clue last year she got so mad about ?
" this dessert just must be sold . "
a few years ago , it was fun .
she got me a beautiful notebook . told me to go write my novel .
a kite
anyway . year four , flowers .
two years since september . we used to live in new york
why did you all move back here ?
oh , i 'm sorry . how is she ?
type a ?
you seem pretty laid-back . type b .
god , i don 't know . i 'd have to look it up at the house .
and you don 't know your wife 's blood type .
maybe it 's type o .
have to ta ke a shower .
you wanna look like you 've been up all night .
that 's a weird thing to say .
please don 't say , " like dad . "
i 'm the twin . margo .
marybeth , i am really sorry .
we didn 't have a lot of choice
should i just go first , and then you guys can say something ?
if anyone out there has any information .
thank you .
should i have said my name ?
she 's bright , she 's beautiful . she 's kind .
you know , there are millions of people out there ..
we care about her , we love her .
amy is a decorated scholar .
you know what ? you 're right .
more games ?
what 's the laptop for ?
you are spending a lot .
you certainly don 't trust my intention .
because it 's easy to throw .
i don 't get why you 're daring me to be someone i don 't wanna be
i 'm sorry .
i flipped burgers , i painted houses , but .
no money , no jobs , no prospects .
mama maureen .
so , we moved to missouri .
nick is happy to be home .
i feel like something he loaded by mistake .
something disposable .
oh , my god !
okay . shh .
rehearsals
i needed to see you .
can you at least tell me you love me ?
why do you ask ?
" and so dedicated , can long endure ... "
i told her it 's not my thing
are you sure this is her ?
she was all in pink .
for valentine 's day , i thought i 'd buy a gun .
nick wants me gone but he won 't ask for a divorce .
you 're a liar and a cheat ! you 're just like dad !
she 's one of my students .
how fucking terrible she made me feel
this is so bad
where , occasionally , andie and i
tanner bolt , would you actually consider defending nick dunne ?
as always , ellen , thank you for such a warm welcome .
listen , just because this guy isn 't walking around weeping
you need to hire tanner bolt
that 's exactly what you deserve .
hey , buddy .
we 're not gonna arrest anybody .
one , i am conducting an investigation , not a witch-hunt
we don 't know who or what was scaring her , gil .
no drug angles panned out yet , so cross that off the list .
the guy 's a bastard , but he 's weak as a kitten , so cross that off the list .
hey .
i do ! you bought great clubs .
this is identity theft ! this is a felony !
all right . let 's talk about life insurance
and my lazy , lying , cheating , oblivious husband
he took and took from me until i no longer existed .
let the punishment fit the crime .
you befriend a local idiot .
credit cards , perhaps online gambling .
bump up your life insurance
you need to package yourself so that people will truly mourn your loss .
as if it 's so hard to spread your legs .
if he likes girls gone wild , she 's a mall babe ..
when i met nick dunne , i knew he wanted cool girl .
i wax-stripped my pussy raw .
i ate cold pizza and remained a size two .
i lived in the moment .
i can 't say i didn 't enjoy some of it .
a lightness , a humor , an ease .
i inspired him to rise to my level .
we were the happiest couple we knew .
but nick got lazy .
he actually expected me to love him unconditionally .
okay . you know where i 'll be
least you could do is not keep his secrets for him .
he 's trying to watch the big game and you just won 't shut up .
i got it .
well , right now , it 's a " he said , she said . "
so , we need to start today to prepare your defense , should we need it .
then we 'll need to realign the public 's perception of amy .
and see her for what she is , which a mind-fucker of the first degree .
there has to be someone out there that she 's screwed with in the past .
eight years ago , she pressed charges against him .
ex-classmate , desi collings .
i meet amy at this party , you know ?
she 's beautiful , she 's smart , she 's well-read
girls like a fixer-upper , but amy ?
paid the ultimate price .
he never introduced himself .
i think we know why .
a little harsh
don 't get me wrong .
i 'm just saying , there are consequences .
she was so alone .
you 're a good friend , noelle . and you 're a good friend of the show .
number of times he visited last year ? one .
his twin sister , margo , well , she is a peach .
playing what , lauren ? playing house ?
what kind of moral rot
can i bum a cigarette ?
and you know what else we won 't forget ?
amen .
hey .
mr. collings .
i wanted to help .
i got your address from this letter that you wrote my wife
she was my first serious girlfriend
you stalked her , you threatened her .
your wife is missing , and you came all this way to tell me this ?
mr. collings .
" he 's gonna kill me . " the end .
it 's private . there 's no one there .
because he tripped the alarm . you were up his ass with a flashlight .
she does the treasure hut .
she 's taking us on a tour of my infidelities . rubbing my nose in it .
which will lead them back to my office .
and she leaves a pair of red panties
my father 's house .
they 'll go after margo .
she 's your accomplice . she helped you hide the evidence .
god .
we find amy .
i 've got two ex-secret service guys that are really good .
but where do they start , nick ?
i have no idea .
hey !
he 's nice .
nope
this is a ticking time bomb . you 've gotta throw yourself on it .
and then , they will forgive you .
people empathize with that .
sharon 's specials , they get 10 million viewers .
i will drill you as if you were doing a deposition .
a trained monkey ?
nick , this case is about what people think of you .
now , you do this and you will reach millions of those people .
was the only thing that 's kept me going these past few years .
i 'd be a pariah . everyone would hate me .
he should go to prison for what he 's done .
it 's utterly secluded .
you know why .
t met nicholas dunne .
why is she dressed like a babysitter ?
of having been romantically involved with a married man .
i truly believed we were in love .
i know that is no excuse .
i do not , in my heart , believe nick dunne would have killed for me .
i apologize for the pain this has caused them .
come on , you 're staring at ghosts .
we now absolutely believe .
our amazing amy .
we 're gonna have to bow out of this .
an hour ago , we were ahead of this . now ?
when we got married , i promised to be that guy .
that guy who , who lives and acts .
if she is out there , able to hear and see you tonight ..
amy , i love you .
come home .
regardless of what you thought ..
i think we can all agree ...
there 's more to him than meets the eye .
they disliked me , they liked me , they hated me .
a candor and an honesty that 's worthy of respect .
what is it ?
girlfriend 's real cute , nick .
i have treated you more than fair throughout this entire investigation .
every time you said something stupid ...
are these the clubs you don 't play golf with ?
none of this was put here by me .
everything just waiting until the wife goes away for good .
shall i read the last entry ?
" this man may kill me . "
judy 's missing handle .
we found this day one , in the fireplace in your home office .
we bagged it .
we just tested it . fire doesn 't erase blood , nick .
you 're under arrest for the murder of your wife .
what about my side ?
more coffee ?
did you notice that it was packed
he hid a lot of stuff at go 's . they 're very close .
by a man with a history of mental problems ?
desi assaulted me that night .
he tied me up like a dog
please find this . please find the tapes .
how did she manage to get a hold of a box cutter ...
can 't you just be happy your wife is home and safe ?
it contains many concerning allegations of mental and physical abuse .
nick didn 't want a baby .
but i love him .
i 'm sorry , i feel myself fading
and i 'd be tied , still , spread-eagle
we prayed to god , and god has answered our prayers .
i 'm not pretending
you do know i was just telling you what you wanted to hear , right ?
you know me in your marrow .
you killed someone , amy . you 're a murderer .
i fought my way back to you .
she told me she killed desi
yeah , because she had me strip naked , and stand in the shower .
and i specialize in fucked-ud .
you should pitch that as reality television .
nick and i have been through some bad patches .
but we thank you so much ...
she 's good .
the real housewives of branson .
i can 't believe you 're just leaving now .
we should hold hands .
so , nick , how does it feel to have your wife back ?
how many people are lucky enough to get a second chance at love ?
" amazing " ?
i 'm gonna need those three things to feel safe .
don 't worry . i know exactly what to say .
the thing is that i 'm a lick strapped at the moment .
your rules .
but when i bend them just a little , we have to sever the partnership .
prohibition , claude , means no liquor .
that man stole my horse .
you tell him to get a gun on his belt . at sundown , we 'll square this up .
sundown .
it 's a time-honoured tradition .
i had to get to your injury , eh ?
uh ... uh , sir ? that is not an area that braves infection with grace !
get outta my way . ill shoot ya . when any stranger could be the end
no . no , no , no . i 'm only saying
pardon my idiot partner 's rudeness .
and some delicious ground nuts ?
very well , mrs. taylor . now , you have to give me
no , i need ' em now .
y es . well , all our apparel is purchased on order .
they stock soap .
so do i absolutely need a shear pin , or can i just use a nail or something ?
talk has it that you 're the montana kid .
says here you killed six men .
you don 't look like a kid . nicknames have a way of sticking .
i guess so .
sundown .
the town hasn 't seen this much excitement
what 's wrong with you people ?
and he might like my shotgun best .
where the hell are you from ?
uppsala . any of you got a hog leg like this ?
well , does anyone got one ? mm-hmm .
uh , what do call it ? a peacemaker !
there 's just not much call for one around here .
a mouthpiece .
come on .
oh , yeah , yeah , you 're right .
that 'd be the shorter straw ,
oh , no , ma 'am , no .
well , then why don 't you do that and run along .
mouthpiece .
whoa ! pardon me .
hey , mr. montana , please ,
general stores sell cough medication . idiot !
i need a part for a gun .
not that many . it 'd be a miracle if he gets off one shot .
.. it 's a nice spot .
it 's where i 'd come when stewart got drunk .
and when he got real mean , i 'd just pull the ladder up and wait .
.. he 'd say that i wasn 't even worth the effort .
not even worth the effort to beat .
well , was he right about you ?
beatin ' on a helpless dog ?
.. there sure as hell is no reason ...
or santa fe and ...
if i was so damn smart to walk away
just beat him up .
" taught a common thief a lesson , " he said .
common .
he was my pa .
... ike it or not ,
and i am what i do .
oh , miss adell ,
you go home . but ...
i said go home now .
you did a hell of a job , i 'll give you that .
put it in your belt .
you 'll blow your nuts off .
ooh .
ow ! ! ! there 's more in there .
doc ! what happened ? !
you shot jack ? !
i 'm disfigured ! yeah , i.i know . i 'm sorry .
except if you kill her ,
already checked in .
what 's it to you ?
so don 't let him open his mouth .
this is a time table when we can access them .
if you sit here , you have the best view .
that 's your call .
aren 't we supposed to talk ?
a line between the elbows .
perfect , and .. morphus .
more like you 're holding a bird or something .
they just put her things in shipping boxes .
i don 't care what happened .
i 'm really worried .
kommen sie .
guten morgen .
okay , well , let 's meet soon .
i 'm almost out the door .
it would make any of them insane .
and it 's good for susie to see us like this .
maybe she even senses what we want of her .
you can see her eyes shine with it .
when i send her our dreams .
i know who i am !
it 's okay .
it 's just a nightmare .
i 'm surprised it took this long .
sorry , i don 't see this .
only ..
and patricia , she did spoke of ..
actual rooms that are secret .
in porcelain , these very fine things .
patricia said that , uh , markos
do they believe they 're witches ?
that 's religion .
the reich had these things .
esoteric ritual .
i don 't know .
patricia could still be in ..
well , i don 't need a baby , jack .
yeah , need a drink .
percentages are not science .
you need instinct . and hear you just lost that .
says he 's available for the morning shift .
said maybe you should go and see him ,
you and joke about that , but some of the guys are concerned .
no asshole tourists on board .
that 's 25 dollars .
her husband arrived on a jet decorated like a cake .
gave carlos 150 for finding champagne at 10am .
going after swordfish again ?
we will .
i don 't like them going over to that kid 's house .
mm , xander 's a bad influence .
huge stoner always walking around
i mean , come on .
but i only told one person . it was too juicy .
this is from longines .
i cannot believe he betrayed my trust .
do you run background checks on your employees
look at her . what is she doing ?
excuse me . sir , hey !
let 's go .
the starters are at the gate .. and we 're ready to go .
what the hell ?
i 'll go talk to the manager .
100 % we 're all there.card 's all there .
it 's all your fault !
here come the cops . you better go before you get recognized .
i 'll take care of it go ! go !
let 's go !
hi , there .
i was wondering if you could help me .
okay , um , listen .
yeah , well , you asked one too many .
why don 't you help me find somebody
all right , well , um .... .
excuse me ?
did you see that one ? yeah .
what are you doing ?

can you do it or not ?
excuse me.who are you ?

you need to sign those so i can collect roland 's device .
yeah , you knew the deal when you came on board .
you want to flush it down the toilet
self got the device.mahone 's still in jail .
so if the general has a problem , he can call me .
i think we got off on the wrong foot .
what 's that ?
oh , yeah , what 's that ?
as easy as that ?
said you were spotted with another male caucasian
here come the cops .
what was it ?
grab as much cash and get out ?
i 'll take care of it . go !
all right , let 's talk about the fifth cardholder .
now , scuderi has major security around his house .
where are the documents ?
it shows the layout of his property .
and that 's how we 're getting in .
look , i know what the score is.it 's every man for himself .
now , i signed on the dotted line
you know , maybe
i mean , i don 't know .
i think he 'd finish what he started .
can i help you with something ?
i just have some things i need to take care of .
you have this ... switch inside you .
shut yourself off .
did it with me .
if i was capable of being her mother ,
bye , emily .
peru ?
i leave two weeks after graduation .
that 's awesome , kayla .
oh my .. jesus .
everybody , stay back ! okay ? stay back !
i can 't steer it or stop it . and the underminer 's escaped !
it 's a superhero 's playground .
you know , after we went underground ...
waiting for something to happen .
oh , i 'm such a hypocrite .
" everyone 's getting the sleep that they lack . "
and i 'm willing to admit
sure . you 're making life easy for them .
i know the chief of police . there won 't be a problem .
if you alone had handled the underminer .
i 'm just saying .
on budget and ahead of schedule ...
specialized motorbike ,
i 'm telling you , honey , it was a saga !
and on your first night !
i 'm proud of you , honey .
and you 'll be amazing .
thanks for handling everything .
i love you , honey . i 'll be back soon .
but now , with you being you , i feel like ..
flew them in from all over .
they have powers , secret identities ...
i 'm screech . it 's a pleasure .
well , thanks . you 're too nice .
nice to meet you , brick . uh , where are you from ?
and trace its origin .
airport ?
superheroes are part of your brainless desire .
you don 't talk , you watch talk shows .
travel , relationships , risk ...
and delivered to you to watch at a distance .
ever passive ...
who can 't bring themselves to rise from their couches .
you want superheroes to protect you .
while you tell yourselves you 're being looked after .
and your rights are being upheld .
smiling at you all the while .
you are no longer in control .
find anything ?
what happened ?
what 's going on ? what did i do ?
that 's right , punk . blame the system .
you 're a genius .
i think i just need a little bit of me time .
oh , you need more than me time , bob .
which leads me to an important announcement .
leaders from more than a hundred
we 'll gather superheroes and leaders
yeah , i invent the stuff , he 's good at people .
l never know what people want .
ease .
it may be crap , but hey , it 's convenient .
my rates are far too high .
he is bright and i am stimulating .
you saw those goggles they put on lucius .
they 're all under someone 's control .
okay . bad guys after us .
no lucius .
and .. what ?
this country raised you .
and this is how you choose to repay it ?
and so ,
sentences are to commence
a rise
let 's talk about this , man , alright ?
i like my cells clean as a plate
step away from the grille .
i could get used to this .
idiot
walk . walk
no . this is .. this is good .
can i ... ?
we 've heard about you .
eight for me . 12 for him .
hold on to that anger .
nobody said stop . move !
one for each slop , my friend .
come on . get it over there .
something 's weighing you down i think .
one of these mornings
but you 're part of a movement now .
ja , so help us .
you don 't even know how many there are .
if they 've got a lock , we can make a key
we can go to mozambique and from there to tanzania .
hey ! you show some respect !
alright , that 's enough ! i suggest that from now
we should turn and follow you now ?
are you my conscience ?
you know that !
every day we sit here , we justify this regime
hey , alright ! alright !
rob .
we said that we 'd put it out of our minds .
i can 't . i 'm sorry .
well , in here , it 's now .
why today ? why is it preying on your mind today ?
a news story ?
i printed it for you .
what ?
oh , it 's not that .
no , i like him . he 's ... fluffy .
it 's just we 've got a lot going on , what with ali and ...
the pet shop guy was ok . it won 't be a problem .
they may not be totally accurate , and they 're often emotional ,
oh , i 've got something that might help .
the accident happened a few hundred meters
no sipping , just take a sniff .
oh .. that 's familiar .
getting something now .
seems to be real .
tg 614 , business class .
no alias ?
worked as a supervisor at a coffee plantation , big one it seems .
he 's definitely not an office worker .
who knows , maybe we 'll get lucky .
uncle , two of the usual , please .
what would you like to drink ?
yes .
like when people say i look like
sheldon , this is not a big deal .
not me
eating-cake-on-the-toilet single .
i have no choice but to confront her .
hang onto it until you 're in trouble
that 's terrible advice .
well , of course not .
well , no , no , he 's over there .
so , what 's the deal with your apartment ?
um , it was a drywall problem .
well , the drywall got wet ,
or damp wall , just as bad . mm .
well , they went to get some ,
i was done at wet wall , but you wouldn 't let it go .
you see , i 'm not in the habit of speaking to people vert much .
talking to people is extremely perilous .
it 's about furniture that belonged to my parents ' villa .
i understand
so what ?
i 'm out of my depth .... what 's the word ?
does mr. oldman already have the pleasure of knowing you ?
perhaps i didn 't make myself clear
in his opinion , the best .
ladies and gentlemen it gives me great pleasure to present lot 231
one million one hundred thousand ! one million two hundred thousand
one million eight hundred thousand in the room !
two million euros ! at two million euros !
at two million euros !
two million five ! i can sell it ! two million seven !
any more ? are we all done ?
sold ! congratulations , sir .
in all honesty , no , never .
what matters is that you 're satisfied .
the love of art and knowing how to hold a brush doesn 't make a man an artist
in all my thirty-six years in this business .
it 's a disgrace an appalling display of bad manners !
i tried to call your office never come near me again ! do you understand ?
i do not possess a mobile phone !
she was hit by a car as she was on her way to meet you .
she was lying in a pool of blood when the ambulance arrived .
yes ?
i had no intention of being in any way disrespectful .
no , fortunately they 'll let me out tomorrow .
that the object plainly hadn 't been there vert long
hi robert , did you manage it ?
this works perfectly now
count on it . can i give you a kiss ?
good evening .
umberto verudd .
is this part of the house inhabited ?
there 've been some changes i don 't know what ..
be that as it may , if your mistress has not materialised by mid-day
fhello ? mr. oldman ?
i don 't know how to apologise . i don 't know what you must think of me , but
is that clear ?
you 'll find it signed.i accept all your conditions ..
the phantom of a silly superficial woman !
i can quite understand your exasperation , mr. oldman ..
it 's been a series of unfortunate unintentional mishaps
which police station did you go to ?
who do you think you are ?
what do you mean ? what kind of question is that ?
i don 't understand
could you hazard a guess as to what it is ?
in the last few years the old couple were both unwell .
or later they 'd have to sell something
what else can you tell me about her ?
i don 't really know her at all .
twenty-six thousand on the telephone ! twenty-eight thousand in the room !
thirty five thousand ! thank you , sir .
fifty thousand ! fifty five thousand !
sixty five thousand on the telephone !
any advance on seventy thousand !
you didn 't get in with your bid in time !
the old trout was behind me . if i 'd seen her i 'd have come in with another bid
but it 's not the first time we 've messed up .
i thought young people had more exciting things to talk about .
that 's vert kind . another time . thank you .
bye . goodbye .
so we 've changed our minds.is that a problem ?
claire lbbetson 's been on the phone .
she asked if you could meet her today , at 2 : .30 .
how did you know it was me ?
to be honest i didn 't expect you 'd want to speak to me .
if i were you , i wouldn 't either
i hope not too tiresome
why do you systematically avoid meeting me ?
a person who arouses such deep-seated aversion in you
if i didn 't believe you i wouldn 't be here playing hide and seek .
it 's been a long time now
if there 's somebody wandering around the house or in the villa
but why ?
it 's a simple question of hygiene . i don 't see the connection .
these seem to me vert similar personal choices .
i see you know my age .
perfect . but i see your personal details are missing
personal details never expire .
i was just a girl then but it 'll do for your purposes .
i understand .
i 'm disgusted by people who don 't trust the colour of their own hair .
sir , there 'll be no more caretaker service as from monday .
why give them to me ?
when you come in , slam the door .
but not impossible .
if they 've been together long enough ,
absolutely .
exactly . she lived for years locked up in an apartment , on her own .
yeah well , what did i tell you ? now he 's gonna be constantly worried about her .
now it 's beautiful , isn 't it ?
there you are , mr. oldman .
how 's our toy coming along
well , maybe . but we 've never seen our android .
so is he
good evening , mr. oldman . it 's claire lbbetson .
no , not at all , miss ibbetson .
you 've done a great job really you have
what would you advise ?
why did you decide to sell in the first place ?
all of the above , i suppose .
well , that 's it . next time we 'll do the paintings .
one last thing , claire .
better in a studio , i don 't want too many people around the house .
i can 't believe it .
i had to do something to make you forgive me .
i don 't want a penny more than i gave the old girl
when i was your friend , your accomplice
you 've found some really important stuff here !
a big step forward , wouldn 't you say ?
now , look .
how many seconds did it take you to realise i was talking about myself ?
let me confess : i didn 't follow your advice .
okay , i see your point .
the mathematical set of a fifty-one minute hour .
tea , please
the edge of a circumference . the centre of space
the vertical position of a sphere .
cast your eye over them carefully because you 'll have to authorise them .
i know , you 'll have to trust me miss lbbetson .
were you offended at being locked out ?
claire , you 're ruining your life for reasons which are beyond me .
even my mother thought i was faking it the first time .
i started screaming and fell to the ground .
has there ever been an open space where you weren 't overcome by anxiety ?
i was fourteen
our automaton is about to emerge from the shadows .
it 's just that
the regard i have for women is equal to the fear i 've always had of them .
well , if that 's the rule then
and what strategy would that be ?
take a gamble , run a risk .
as long as you 're playing according to her rules
t don 't know
perhaps the smaller size ?
lambert. are you married ?
what 's it like , living with a woman ?
you never know if yours will be the best offer .
what do you think ? have i made myself pretty ?
youl 're a liar .
i haven 't done this for centuries
ah , maybe we did get the last moves wrong
robert ! my aunt 's gone missing again !
beg your pardon . we found her in the central park .
she can wonder off as far as she likes now you 'll never lose touch with her .
i can manage that . you are an angel .
i 'll see you tomorrow night , yeah ? yes
maybe you should invite her to dinner .
then at the romantic climax of the evening , by candle light
well , if you want to invite me why not ?
well , who said anything about joking ?
thank you .
eight hundred and thirty-one point three three , three .
you 've done a wonderful job virgil
to your serenity , claire .
and now i feel i can finally tell you .
but i warn you , as a waiter i 'm not of the highest class .
1'il take the risk
because if the service were not to be to your liking .
a child loses his parents a horrible orphanage that sort of thing
do you know , in an old article of yours i found the other day on the internet
often it 's just a trifle a detail of no interest
you couldn 't have been more convincing
well , if i didn 't know about her problems
no , really . i liked her .
if you want my advice , virgil ..
mr. oldman , do you want lots 87 and 88 done separately ?
how can i help you ?
what 's going on ?
all those girls hovering around him ..
is there anything i can do ?
i don 't understand
i feel so stupid .
i promise .
if you 'd phoned i wouldn 't have kept you waiting
one of my assistants will come by today. as it is
i think i 'm at least due an explanation , aren 't 1 ?
it 's weird seeing them all so perfect and polished up .
i believe nothing is missing
it still is . it always will be .
you have to get out of here . and you have to do it by yourself
i 'm telling you ...
did she have any friends , y 'know people she could 've gone to ?
if she 's gone out she can 't have gone far .
one hundred and fifty thousand gentleman on my left !
one hundred and seventy thousand !
two hundred thousand gentleman on my left in the room .
two hundred and fifty thousand on the telephone !
robert 's looking further afield . all right .
all right .
three hundred and ten thousand euros ! any more ?
virgil ,
thanks , robert .
what do you hope is gonna happen ?
someone with her problems doesn 't just disappear into thin air .
it doesn 't matter how deeply rooted it is
maybe something happened between you two .
you know perfectly well that 's impossible .
i 'd never have guessed that you would have ended up in a mess like this .
all you had to do was listen .
i 'd say .. i don 't know
with her that he carried her off by force .
i 've had my doubts lately about robert .
literature , exactly .
she could have had her own reasons for disappearing
i wouldn 't be so sure , if i were you .
they seem just like the original
y 'know , just like on the first day .
i want to coax her out .
she 's too fragile .
hello ?
virgil !
hold it up !
why do you say you don 't love it ?
let 's go back inside .
yes , but the plan was never realised except for the inaugural reception .
i too have an important announcement to make .
it will be the finest of my career .
they say he 's been seen recently in female company .
so , it 's finally come home to him that the worst sexual perversion is chastity .
that 's nice of them .
anyhow , i 'm happy , claire . i just wish you were here
don 't let it get to you.we have all the time in the world to travel .
have you heard from our young friends ?
i 'm never left on my own if that 's what you 're worried about .
i can hear you 've got to go .
i know , but she did this amazing thing for me .
i 'd feel a whole lot better if i knew that she was on board .
we 'll be quick . karev .
okay , what is that about ?
do another loop there . beautiful .
i have a good teacher .
don 't be a pig .
well , the thong is unprofessional .
you all sound really old .
and i know sometimes i don 't listen ,
ready to listen ?
you want to hear what i 'm saying and really take it in
also , it 's funny when they fall down .
he 's doing fine . his spine 's been stabilized ,
his recovery will be slow and painful .
this was supposed to be the best day of our lives .
with the horses and the ... bagpipes .
we don 't get marriage in washington .
we get to go to city hall
so call me crazy , but ..
and i fought for it .
stood in the cold outside the statehouse .
i know this sounds really confusing ,
okay . i 'm going to yoga .
oh , you should go with her , gloria !
i would love it . bye !
i don 't even know why i try .
oh , well , that 's just claire , you know ?
you gotta break through those walls .
you really think so ?
forge that friendship !
okay , thank you ! i 'm just gonna lie here ...
i knew for a fact claire never returned my tupperware .
and when i did ,
oh , hey ! i thought you were going to the pharmacy .
i think i 'm just upset about this stupid thing with my dad .
waiting till i 'm 40 when she looks me up on facebook
what are you doing ?
it 's time to make her notice you !
we got a full tank of gas , and she 's right down the block .
i 'll know .
she was such a sweet little doll .
i 'm having trouble adjusting to all this .
no , she 's broken .
it happens . dolls grow up .
oh , i understand congratulations
you 've come a long way this past year .
well , now that you 're here , i guess we can begin .
what 's going on ?
well then , why risk it ?
i just have to make sure the security we 've put in
i , uh , don 't think so ,
the way they treat you , you 'd think
no , i 've been invited because i 'm the last of
it 's complicated .
and do you remember what happens uh , when you
but i still don 't understand . i mean ...
it 's not logical . how ?
look , i know it doesn 't look like much ,
now , at the push of a button , we 're able to ...
wow .
well , what about that third one ?
what would happen if he was freed ?
i 'm looking to do more i think i need to
what ?
come on .
okay , are there any windows ?
you 're letting him get away !
back off
what the hell was that ?
the sword is a fake .
rugal 's going back in .
chizuru , it 's just a game .
if you don 't mind , it 's time for my father to rest
the highest form of goodness is like water .
it stays in places loathed by all men .
in choosing your dwelling ,
we make a vessel from a lump of clay
thus while it is the tangible has advantages ,
hori !
where have you been ?
i didn 't mean to worry you .
i mean , you just disappeared .
code blue ! code blue ! get me a crash cart , stat !
and you 've sent out a warning to the fighters ?
excellent .
they don 't know they 're playing
i 'm up .
no one 's supposed to accept challenges until
i 've never heard of two fighters
there 's a first time for everything .
i don 't know . something 's wrong .
i knew you two would have .
who are you ?
i 'm the king of . fighters ! rugal !
you can 't change the rules .
i can do whatever i want .
yeah , i just got out of the tournament .
rugal has improved the gameplay .
you should totally do it ...
well , the cia can 't do that anymore .
you want to tell me about this ?
i 'm cia
it 's too bad the sword was a fake . nice try .
i just want to know where he is .
let me guess , he 's hiding in your
is that so ? then why do you need me ?
other dimension , king of tooth fairies .
people are dying ...
and you want me to believe you and your crazy stories ?
who 's mai ?
oh , that mai .
if you don 't believe me , go talk to her .
you know we 're wasting our time here .
it can give you great strength and power
is that why you left ?
what did you do to my father ?
my father was completely unresponsive for 10 years ,
it 's about our families .
you still haven 't told me what it is you 're you 're doing here .
what sword ?
what about what lori said ?
your boyfriend didn 't tell you ?
all right .
he wanted to be the king of fighters and harness its power .
so the clans united , and one of my ancestors killed
well , it 's happening again . that 's why i 'm here .
oh ! here we go with the dimensions bullshit .
dimensions , dimension .
it doesn 't happen .

that 's it . that 's it .
no , i 'm taking you off the case .
he 's taking you off this case ?
tell me something , mai , is there anyone in this room
well , i came to stop you .
come on , let 's be honest , you have issues .
well , i got my issues under control , but , uh , you , um ...
well , you just going to stand there
and it begins .
there he is .
that 's the spirit .
you know its power , what it feels like .
together , we can be invincible .
i don 't know , a place where i can be me .
can you ?
i 'm looking for a lot of things .
i need your help .
he gave you the name .
i repair motorcycles , i 'm not a hero .
you don 't even know what you are .
you did what ?
i trusted you with that . she trusted me .
so if there is some other dimension , like you say ,
chizuru ... thank you for coming .
she trusts me .
rugal is becoming more and more powerful ,
these dimensions exist in what could more
you see , rugal was able to get access to
hey ..
she 's in there .
you had the sword this whole time ?
look ... you barge into my life
it 's here now , and i 'm ready to go in .
i know .
i will .
i 'm strong enough .
please .
you don 't even believe in orders .
show us how these things work , scotty .
what are you doing here ?
what do you think , i 'm just going to leave you ?
chizuru ?
for a while there , i thought you wouldn 't make it .
i am king of fighters .
this world is all i need .
this isn 't life .
when my world expands and merges with
i 'm invincible .
not as long as we have the sword .
where are you ?
do you know what this place is ?
it was your father 's favorite setting .
my father would never hurt me .
come on , this is boring .
i don 't know. too violent .
hey , this is more like it .
terry ?
oh , man . maybe you did travel to another dimension .
learning , for oscar , will be a slow process .
day after day , it takes a committed mom to teach him
a gathering storm excites scar 's forces .
this damn thing is so uncomfortable .
we 're in marriage counseling , bree .
this is business .
boy the movies ever get the wrong .
you 're very tense .
find a way to rela .
do i have to go ?
by the way , you won 't be drinking at this party .
no , but , god , you should have seen the look on his face .
i mean , he 's coming to the party , right ?
oh , he 's not going to come . big surprise .
god , i hate when i get that way .
you know what ? it 's not going to change until you resolve your issues with that man .
yeah , but i can see her little mind working away .
come on , ashley .
i don 't understand . why do we need private sessions ?
oh , well , i don 't have any personal issues .
okay , i know what just happened is funny in theory ,
uh , susan had a problem finding something to wear .
pretty much .
well , i 'm sure you can figure a way to put them to bed , tom .
in college , when we first started dating ,
everybody knew we were going to have this wonderful life .
because you can 't even let me pack my own suitcase .
hey .
it 's good to see you again , ethan .
there 's a microwave tracker in his neck .
let me just assure you , this won 't hurt
you and your apostles think we 're gonna trade you
" your mission , should you choose to accept it . "
while every day the master you serve moves one step closer to ending the world .
sixty seconds .
i 'll do it my way .
enough games . i 'm taking you out of here .
he 's gone to the meeting , with a copy of you .
call the apostles . warn them .
for their safety and mine .
they 'll know as soon as we leave the building .
i haven 't finished with hunt yet .
then the pervert got obsessed with me .
so i stole the painting , you know ,
this house is incredible .
yeah . ugh . sorry .
you don 't need to do that . you don 't need to apologize .
you don 't need to be sorry for anything , ever .
thank you .
thanks . yeah .
i just didn 't think i would end up a single mom ,
i put half of that away for miles ' college ,
yeah .
fucking have to pay for everything .
we bought it during the bubble .
here . cheers to being house poor .
mmm . what ?
it 's just another one of my bad decisions .
is that a charity symbol ?
it 's a nice contrast with your ring .
or maybe you can get her to start .
i 'm sure it 's 5 : 00 somewhere .
he 's such a brilliant writer .
not enough , apparently .
oh , i figured you 'd want a break
what 'd she tell you ?
and i called her office ,
i mean , i 've played through
i 'm flying back tomorrow .
yeah . she has a very high-profile job
what are you implying , exactly ?
something to make you run off to london ?
you leave town , your wife takes off .
excuse me , that 's very rude .
i have seen him with his wife , let me tell you ,
well , that avenue is a dead end , so you can drop it .
she doesn 't have any .
i 'm sorry , i didn 't know that .
her name is emily nelson .
emily 's not in today .
especially the powerful ones .
listen , you bargain basement tom ford ,
because if you lose moms , you lose business .
number two , tom ford wishes he were me .
you 're ..
better pray i don 't have a bruise .
look at our little stephanie .
is this a game , like when you smash everything with trucks ?
i 'm not lying ! i saw her ! fuck you !
i 'm sorry .
of course you do , sweetie .
it was because of you .
it 's probably the most responsible thing we ever did .
move in with me .
just you , me and the boys .
i love you , stephanie smothers .
hi , moms . this is stephanie here .
but i do think that we live on after we die , so ..
and you 'll always be nicky 's mom .
i can just try to love the people that you love
okay , guys , it 's getting too rough back there .
not me . i came back to life .
okay , the dolls are going in your backpacks
you 'll see nothing but smiles .
hi . i 'm looking for the mclanden foundation .
who 's this ?
i 'm the director of the squaw lake bible camp .
well , we are putting together the 50th anniversary
she 's quite a woman , your mother .
you met my mother ?
we had a little walk down memory lane .
bet you couldn 't do anything right in her eyes .
but then , all the bad ideas were faith 's , weren 't they ?
for fuck 's sake .
she 's gotten to you , hasn 't she ?
it 's got everything to do with her .
you go alone ?
obviously , he can 't really sneak around anymore , so ...
i was thinkin ' , if anyone asks about that fire at rick 's ,
i didn 't start the fire .
if anyone thinks you did , it 'd be handy if y could prove them wrong , wouldn 't it ?
i know . i just .. i can 't stop now .
well , um , as much as i appreciate this naked display of emotion ,
really ?
no . never .
oh , sure , you can .
i simply picture an empty box , and i take whatever i 'm feeling and put that in the box ,
in private , like a lady .
i 'm gonna try that .
prove me wrong , sweetie . prove me wrong .
okay , carlos , here 's the harness .
how do i get roxy to fetch it for him ?
roxy doesn 't do that .
i get that , but surely she 's trained to do other stuff ,
don 't ve me your blind sarcasm .
do you have one of those ?
really ? well , for a dog who 's supposed to help us , she sounds kind of limited .
it 's not your favorite ?
excuse me . i have to put something in a box and stick it in the closet .
got it .
uh , which is why i haven 't told her .
well , when bree and orson were staying with us ,
no , this was the next night .
but like i said , he was asleep , so it 's probably nothing .
he said .. " i 'm sorry i ran over mike . "
he didn 't even know you when that happened .
yeah , that 's what i figured .
we don 't need any more drama in this house .
how 's the move going ?
no , thanks . we 're almost done .
let me just run something by you .
ashysasha gor a call today from a couple who loved our work on the founder 's ball .
yes , and they want to hire us to do their anniversary party .
we could be . think about it .
well , w it 's a cherished recipe from catering by katherine .
this is shameless emotional blackmail .
and .. it worked beautifully . i 'm in .
but she 's been so good .
i 'm giving her a treat .
fine . one treat .
so i guess that means you won 't be getting your hair done anymore .
just picture the middle one all by itself .
but since you love her so much , i 'm gonna keep looking .
i 'm not sure .
oh , that 's ...
it 's just that i have so many questions , and ...
and we 'd keep this from your mom ?
uh , i think we might be out of candles .
rick .
okay .
you see ? i can talk slow , too .
oh , i think you were busy at the time ... kidnapping his guide dog .
don 't judge me .
we 're fine .
this is our relationship .
not that much . just his eyes .
we have to move .
i know this is difficult ,
trust me , he 's already been there .
he should pay for what he did .
how come daddy 's sleeping on the couch again ?
come on .
mommy and daddy are sont of ... fighting ,
oh , something he did that made mommy really mad .
yes , of course .
we heard daddy say that man wanted to take you away from us .
it 's to always bring it .
and when did you leave hong kong ?
it had gotten a little difficult with the police on one side
he got into so many street fights that by 18 ,
to go when you 're still a star is very strange ,
he didn 't ever look at people
taky kimura was really his best friend .
he was five years older than we were ,
we both attended the university of washington .
and then when we were both done with our classes ,
in the rest of the country there were no interracial marriages .
my mother was not thrilled when we decided to get married ,
that didn 't mean the ban lifted in people 's hearts .
the bigger guy equally
he would just put it down no matter how big you were .
whether bruce lee was a great fighter or wasn 't a great fighter
i made that as a joke , of course .
every time i said it at that time ,
as a kid , we watched green hornet for him .
he had a fly car , i 'll give him props for the car ,
a lot of stunt guys didn 't know
with him , it 's boom , boom , boom , boom ,
thats something i can really
the beauty was that he immediately said ,
really ? you didn 't like yourself ? i didn 't see it .
martial art has a very ,
he really did read
he had a huge library of
as an actor , as a martial artist , as a human being ,
and you can take most of the passages from that book
was how can i most efficiently
the other stuff was hollywood .
do you understand ?
and that 's not to say that it can 't be passed on .
our main event , for the light heavyweight title ,
how does it differ from , say , our kind of boxing ?
second to none .
oh ! beautiful elbow !
you name it , man , we use it .
i mean the .. everything , i mean , not just the hand .
there 's no debate .
i do think ther 's a correlation there ,
in 1963 you 'll see gene
and he was out , like ,
i 'd throw him and flip him and
and he was a magnificent athlete .
he 's before anyone else .
that bothers me .
and if you don 't believe me , i 'll choke you
people get pissed off and bombed out and everything else .
he was so directed and
" the right punch comes .
yourself ?
and did that part , just expressed myself like i say
was he too ?
you 've had everybody as your student .
i don 't know if you remember them .
i said . this is what it is ok
now , you put water into a cup
you put it in a teapot , it becomes the teapot .

i would spend hours whipping
it became like a household product .
after i watched this movie , i used to use that .
right out of the gate i swung
and after that i stopped making the noise
i got into it because i stopped carrying a gun .
i 'm not ashamed to admit it .
this one particularly is sentimental for me .
he wants to put a little more
and he was adamant he was not going to the set .
he could lose his temper .
linda was that fabulous wife .
i was talking behind the
let me think .
and they 're all better off , the world is better off ,
enter the dragon was hollywood 's first dipping its toe
the opening scene , bruce lee
i haven 't seen any actor in an action film
destroy the image and you will break the enemy .
this is the moment that he was waiting for .
bruce was in a studio doing dubbing for enter the dragon
and he was unconscious and i was talking to him ,
ted wong used to always tell me ,
he had just had a collapse .
he told me that he 'd had an ok from ucla that his body was fit .
bruce lee faces a real dilemma .
so what does he chose , the east or the west ?

i believe the appropriate metaphor here
there 's got to be other options .
but based on nasa 's latest timetable ,
oh , snap .
okay , i guess we have to turn to plan b .
erase all the hard drives , scrap the surveillance tapes ,
will you all excuse me ?
no . yeah , i remember specifically .
well , that does sound like me , but no .

you 're selling military weapons to the cartel .
you 're lucky we got here first .
you 're the one that taught me that the law
oh , shit .
you have the right to remain silent .
machete don 't smoke .
the way i see it , you ain 't got much to chew on , hombre .

you know , the first thing we are taught is to defend ourselves .
you think my mom had bite ?
that was your mother ?
look , don 't be a fucking hero , man .
he 'll skin you alive for laying your hands on me .
the terrible things he did , he did them for the greater good .
machete , you have to promise me
if you 've ever loved anyone , you 'd understand .
who 's this ?
i 'm gonna kill your men , steal your choppers , get you over the wall .
and find the other one that can disarm you .
let me take care of him . please
$ 10 million .
and the best part is ,
$ 10 million ! if the assassins don 't get us , the cartels will .
and , boy it 's a long way to the wall .
what 's the status ? is he dead ?
in a chopper . he 's alive .
machete , what 's this i hear about you having mendez in custody ?
i could .
i 'm truly sorry , ma 'am .
iam lost . can you help me with directions ?
" maneater . "
so , one night , i gave him what he deserved .
the next day ,
i think that pussy clouds their minds .
and that 's where you come in .
madame ?
we 've found them .
bring me my double-ds .
we 're going to avenge my cereza .
you read my mind , machete .
not by choice , but i can i get the , uh , cd to change for the life of me .
well , i 'm trying to find a place called villa guerrero .
allow me to use a more useful illustration .
and if you say " no se " one more time ,
ugh , that 's disgusting !
good for you , machete . good for you .
i can 't continue to live my life like this .
and then you became a revolutionary .
i was never cartel .
my mission was to infiltrate los cuerpos .
i had to do things .
you need a stronger vehicle , an armoured vehicle ,
there 's a chop-shop there .
once he crosses the border , we can move in .

that 's right , sheriff .
sayonara , taco .
how many of you are there ?
what the hell is that ?
you didn 't think it would all be over once we crossed the border , did you ?
there is a grand conductor behind all this .
he dished out $ 6 million of taxpayer money
he took a stand and defended our second amendment with a vengeance .
my fellow americans , it 's been a groovy four years .
for me , winning was only the beginning .
it 's the simple things that fund
why ?
but given mendez 's aptitude for the unpredictable ,
higher than you could mentally ascend to .
technically speaking , space shuttle .
it all started about six years ago .
i saw the future
aboard it , me and anyone who wants to join me will take flight .
noah had his ark , i got mine .
i believe what i see .
i see glimpses of what lies ahead .
good luck .
or three ?
clones .
just as i predicted .
i created my clones because where i 'm going , i 'm going to need an army .
but since you fucked him up like a special ed science fair project ,
i need a stronger specimen from which to draw a new batch of clones
but what if there were more ?
machete , machete . every where machete !
surely you know by now that i know how all this turns out .
oh , and where will you go ?
the world is fucked .
this world must end in order for a more perfect one to emerge .
goddamn , you 're good
my molecule blaster doesn 't quite work right yet .
what took you so long ?
it 's in space .

we need to find someone to disarm it
osiris .

said he 'd changed his tune .
i know that you would prefer to see me all sorts of dead ,
to finish your brother 's work .
here you are .
ladies and gentlemen , your host , voz !
and once the world is purged ,
but first , my friends , prepare for infinity !
why don 't you tell them the truth ?

there was nobody in the world like his son .
bobby 's father was very busy as a doctor
.. who was rather strict . he was the boss .
he made the rules and eddy was supposed to follow .
and why do you say it couldn 't have been good ?
this was the last picture we ever had of edward .
he got into all the things young boys do .
i mean , occasionally i disciplined him .
eddy was more artsy , kinda kid , you know , he wasn 't into sports .
he was a teacher , he was all about punctuality .
this ?
uh , so something like ..
no , it doesn 't have a face .
not here . nothing 's wrong here .

give me something to work with .
and as i 'm saying this ,
i ripped the middle right out of my spanx .

it 's a popular class , and the other moms come early .
lauren , i 'm a mother of four . today i had to get up at five ,
and things like being told to plan ahead make me so crazy
it 's a vicious cycle . see how that works ?
the moms who followed the rules would get pissed .
see how that works ?
well , we might as well give the people what they want .
what they do know is ... martha died a violent death .
apparently there was a struggle .
now . i think it 's time that you return to your homes ,
their parents can 't leave london .
so where are you headed ?
i 'm flying officer burnstow , but you can call me harry .
i 'm sure you are .

family , your home , a memory , a faraway place .

edward , would you come with me , please ?

a ghost ?
was it your mommy ?
leave him alone ! stop being horrible .
a few minutes ago .
you 'll have some tea ?
you 've taken quite a shine to flying officer burnstow .
no , nor do i
was your husband called up ?
both army families . now our boys .
do you have any photos ?
but you must miss them .
i 'm sorry .
well , i 'm sure they 'll come back to you .
says i 'm the toughest soldier he 's ever met .
but our own worst enemy is ourselves .
despair .
good night , eve . i hope you sleep better tonight .
what do you mean ?
did you speak to them ?
i think you should keep your visions to yourself .
no , you listen to me .
i provided when she could not .
the horse somehow lost its footing
e sank so fast .
you 're too late
you brought her back .
you brought her back . your fault .
i move lights around , make it look like planes are taking off .
i 'm a decoy .
i was , but after the crash ... i couldn 't fly anymore
ln f
which is unfortunate , because i have a fear of nets .
movies , yes .
and remember , he 's more afraid of you than you are of him .
no , i was talking to the bird .
sheldon , just ignore him .
oh , much better . all right .
make a pot of tea , leonard . it 's going to be a long night .
for a prostate exam , yes .
i 'm going to the movies with penny .
do you think it 's a date ?
you should !
good ! go ! there are some girls right over there .
they 're in a group . i 'm scared .
you 're biologists .
that 's a living thing ; get cracking .
it 's remarkable .
and for what ?
oh , dear .
oh , it 's just like my grandma with her parrot .
my phone 's on the desk over there .
make it good enough to go on a mug , a mouse pad , and a calendar .
oh . who am i kidding ?
ugh , i am so embarrassed !
what did you tell them ?
fine ? you said it was fine ?
you put it in front of " wine " or " dining , "
it was. okay .
yeah , it 's a perfectly good word .
want a glass of wine ?
you know , have a little wine , take the edge off .
don 't talk , just drink .
how could you possibly know that ?
a precise relationship that is not present
under the terms of my roommate agreement with leonard ,
oecanthus fultoni .
okay , okay , tell you what .
i can 't take your money .
that is not toby ,
oh , i really don 't care anymore .
yiddish was not spoken in east texas .
yeah , fine , whatever .
we haven 't established that i 'm wrong once . all right .
tell you what . let 's go down
i bet i could throw a rock in this room
if 's like silence of the lambs down here .
you 're such a girl .
well , apparently , i was wrong .
enjoy oxnard .
oh , hey , sheldon .
old comic book .
what do you have a safe deposit box for ?
i lost this to wolowitz in an ill-considered cricket wager .
and it 's going to protect me from the crushing force down at the
that 's like having two humvees stacked on your thumbnail
the reason for that is we 'd just rather spend the time at the bottom
so , nature provided an example
it 's designed from the ground up as a science platform .
a sample tray in the science door .
a payload bay for instruments .
every single thing on this vehicle has to be built from scratch
is that it shrinks over two inches during the dive from pressure .
yeah , it 's still got to go in quite a way .
but we 're also fighting the pressure of time .
how big a problem is that ?
if not , it will be boxing day .
you don 't compromise
i need to have the shot cut right about here . it 's a close up , okay ?
at the core of it is this idea of going deeper and seeing what 's down there
because i knew that in the making of that film ,
pitch black . going to another world .
and it wasn 't a legend anymore .
and something about looking out at that rusty deck ,
amdrew wight has tu al ouur expeditions since 200
our next target would take us even deeper .
the infamous german battleship was sunk
the guns are silent now ...
the whole ship somehow preserved in the underworld
okay , that could be a way in .
what is your reaction to this ?
to the day .
okay , the camera boom is also wired backwards .
okay . all right . that explains that .
now , be advised temperature is 100 degrees . 100 degrees .
okay , i think it 's time to descend one meter . over .
that 's the big dive . one meter .
well , the compass worked .
this dive will also provide mike
a comms signal is coming through strong and clear .
200 units and down thrust in . just easing down .
surface , i am on the bottom .
super , super successful dive . everything worked .
in general , that i just .. it just felt wrong to even be trying to co
andrew and mike were like family to me .
it just went chomp . i was literally inside the jaws of the shark .
there was just this big rip across the fabric of reality
i think the one thing i 've earned from all of this
don 't put it off till later because it 's ...
safe travels . see you .
but right away there 's so many things to do ,
deepsea challenger , a comms mermaid , how do you copy ? over .
we were diving just on the south side of new britain island ,
they call it subduction and it 's because the continents
and the pressure just builds and builds
when that fault slips in one of these deep trenches ,
we could save a lot of lives if we could predict these events ,
surface , deepsea challenger . i am on the bottom .
i 'm two-and-a-half miles down , same depth as titanic ,
keep it coming .
i 'll bet they didn 't intend that .
when the dive begins , it 's exciting .
and then you just go into darkness .
and you just fall for a long , long time .
can stretch to there and to there .
i 'm doing it for real .
tl 's cool
my thrusters are running away and they won 't respond .
i think we got a problem .
without thrusters i can 't even stop . this is not good .
everything 's getting haywire and i 'm getting deeper and deeper .
speed 's 1.9 knots . i still can 't stop from that . i 'll hit the bottom too fast .
i 'm going to have to drop some shot . i 'm going too fast .
and dropping shot , here we go .
oh , shit .
surface , deepsea challenger . descent is aborted .
and pretty soon you realize you 're in this kind of dead metal coffin ,
and we 're going to hit hurdles like this where we think
touchdown
lights are working
a lot of very happy people up here .
oh , what 's that ?
copy you loud and clear .
all stop , all stop .
this ship 's got to go back .
we 've got to dive , even if it means
and verticals d own
i predict we 'll be about ..
a little bit ate , but not much .
we 're on target right now .
there 's of course an element of fear in it ,
i 'm only minutes away from diving the challenger deep
goldy , a bit more out , please .
here we go .
yeah , copy that , tim . thanks .
hatch looks good so far .
deepsea challenger , five minutes from drop zone .
deepsea challenger , surface check .
carbon dioxide is 0.5 percent .
oh , man .
the soft ballast bag has deployed . the hatch popped .
yeah roger , i 've got that . i can see that .
and there 's still 9,000 feet to go .
it just gets really quiet .
and you feel yourself just getting farther and farther and farther
time to shed some shot .
35,200 feet .
get everything on .
let 's get this spotlight aimed down .
100 feet .
i am on the bottom .
and life support 's good .
oh , my cod .
this is how the nasa team must have fe
god speed to you , baby . i love you .
surface be advised , i 'm starting my transect to the north . over .
so we have this fantasy that the deeper we are , the bigger the monsters .
i see a lot of hydraulic oil coming out .
all right .
i think we might have a sample there .
okay , mow
yeah , it just spins me around .
surface , deepsea challenger , preparing to ascend . over .
weights are coming off
weights are off . on ascent . over .
exploration is never done .
you know , he 's driven us hard
who ?
the last time i shook my booty
well , you signed that paper that said if i did ,
who ?
i know what it is .
see ?
you ask a guy his name
holla !
oh , no . how did you find me here ?
you know what 's not a secret ?
whole foods is where i come to get my groove on .
as much as i 'd love to see what else you 're gonna buy
it 's tuesday , and the dj didn 't come .
no ! he didn 't show at all .
well , what did you expect ?
stop calling it a club !
what if i judged you for some of your jobs ?
what about when you worked at the gap ?
you , that time you were drunk , folding a sweater ,
maybe sebastian needs the money , too .
and if you ever tell anyone about the gap ,
still counts as a dj shout-out .
why don 't i take a break and we can go in the back .
busy !
hilary waldare works here , as a cashier !
oh please , this is real .
what , you couldn 't wait for me ?
the kelly with the cystic acne ,
i 'm glad you have no line ,
i 'm a cashier .
my husband left me for my dad .
well , i 'm sure you 'll pull yourself together like i did .
there 's only $ 14 here .
didn 't want the dinosaur kale .
oh , i don 't usually shop for myself .
caroline , do you not have enough money ?
i just don 't know why i have so many eggs .
you know , maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer .
well , you must have someone in your family that 's a lawyer .
that 's amazing !
is that really what 's important right now ?
that 's super helpful , amy .
get out .
yeah , we actually dumped her retainer in the toilet
but otherwise ,
oh , thanks . you know , i just wanted to get some work done
i 'm sorry .
you really think they 're gonna start treating you differently ?
i 've always been treated differently !
i mean , the first thought when you see me isn 't ,
i understand how you feel .
the business made us destroy it .
yeah . we found some in a truck
truck 's manifest led us here .
company sends us all kinds of material to shred .
hey , somebody has to lose the super bowl , right ?
maybe someone fell in .
not to mention osha .
you 're gonna have to shut it down right now , boss .
we want to talk to everybody who worked that night shift .
hey , got one right here .
except for the big stuff ,
that 's it ; that 's the whole graveyard shift .
well , maybe they didn 't have to .
all this came from the one truck with the body parts ?
did you really sign up for this ?
still got wendy on your mind , huh ?
believe me , i get it .
good night out on the town .
when ?
i got " yuck . "
somebody 's in a good mood .
you have a ... certain glow .
detective vartann 's a good man .
i , uh , sent representative samples to dna .
obviously , the body 's too mangled
i took a tissue sample .
i 'll give you a tour .
are you thinking entry wound ?
bullet frag .
greg found bullet fragments
you know this guy ?
haven 't you 've seen his online ads ?
i just signed up last month .
every aspect of our life has been reduced
my name is larry lamotte , and i want to ask you a question .
you 're larry lamotte ?
now , did i hear you gentlemen correctly ?
you look younger on tv .
marketing 101 .
and who is the man in front of the camera ?
yeah , he can 't string two sentences together ,
well , as i was , uh , telling mr. kaplan ,
the credit cards were in your name .
hell , they even repossessed my truck
six of ' em .
you running the credit card
on the computer in the bullpen .
i 'm checking my purchases .
i can 't believe that i trusted those guys .
it 's like that friend that you meet in science camp ,
and then he starts showing you this sketchbook ,
it 's not the same .
right , but could still come from the same victim .
a previous incident .
over time , the body 's defense mechanism
maybe this shred of evidence will help .
cartridge case from the shooting .
no , the only good thing about a case going cold is
okay , so we 've got two shootings , six years apart .
there 's got to be a connection somehow .
then someone kills julius kaplan ,
could be .
shredder guy had a credit card
right .
maybe he wanted larry lamotte to know he was in town .
i mean , julius kaplan said it himself .
well , he might be , if the thief is threatening
dmv in florida
well , if he 's larry lamotte ,
we pulled a six-year-old print off it .
you have a very impressive cv .
goodbye , larry lamotte .
arlo karden doesn 't have the same ring to it , i 'll give you that .
information is currency .
and you turned it into cold , hard cash .
knows every phone call ,
you knew about the blackmail .
you even knew
the thing about the " quo " is ,
and the " quid pro quo " started a long time ago .
" honey , can you grab me a cup of coffee " ?
" sweetheart ,
we spoke with lee devries .
you used his identity to rent a getaway car
naturally , we 'd be looking for devries and not for you .
1ll 1111
she calls it " the bosom 's welcome mat . "
no . this is just to give you ideas .
i mean , do you want a train ?
not the kind of trains you like .
the kind on the back of a wedding dress ?
but while we 're on the subject of fashion ,
mm . well , i 've got a push-up bra i can loan you
$ 500 million .
what do you need that kind of money for ?
i just need 2,148 high-power lasers
sheldon , they 're not gonna give you half a billion dollars .
no . shh .
well , it 's too much money , you can 't ask for that all at once .
okay . what if you asked for $ 20 million ?
we have a deal ?
no . that 's only a two letter word .
well , i 'm sorry , sheldon , but this sort of thing happens .
50 years ?
you just have to wait for science to catch up
you know what they say :
oh , don 't be silly .
just be gentle .
you don 't seem like you really want to sell these .
these are all important to me ,
is it okay if i stand here and watch ?
if anyone asks , tell them i was brave .
i know , right ? that was crazy .
do you know how that makes me look ?
right ? !
and i even used the perfume he gave me in fifth grade ,
it 's the most beautiful gesture i have ever seen .
the horn doesn 't help , does it ?
but i can 't decide between mate or satin .
we decided against eggshell .
why don 't we just paint the floor eggshell
she brought that frog back to life !
t-they 're suggesting that she skip fifth grade
we 're not charting out the next 20 years of her life .
if we don 't do this right ,
i 'm just saying
luke 's first haircut .
well , that 's it .
you remember when he hid that mouse trap under the pillow
yeah , so maybe splash some cold water on your face
my name is luke dunphy
that 's what he said when i was the tickle monster !
well , i guess you can 't have cake today .
claire , i guess i 'm picking up the cake myself ,
this is my new friend , charlie .
he smells so good !
what is going on ?
i know . it happens so fast .
today he gave us a rolls-royce .
i thought i was gonna be able to meet mr. burt reynolds !
the one time that i thought
i 'm gonna kill him !
oh , yes . this is it . this is the one .
the lunch scene in a strip joint
maybe one where we just sat at a table .
unless you want to skip all that
i learned how to shoot a gun when i was eight .
l had nightmares about the basement .
i 've spent my entire life trying to get over the paranoia
yeah , that quarterback thing is all messed up .
what is she gonna do with herself ?
she 'll be all right .
why do we have to come out again ?
what ? you don 't. you don 't enjoy it ?
but hey .
cancel halloween ?
l need to go do a number two almost immediately .
you deserve better .
allyson , you 're the coolest , you 're the prettiest ,
thank you .
let 's get out of here .
from a clinical perspective ,
they can grow accustomed to always being afraid ,
but there 's also the other side .
we do one more hit , we have the cash to get started .
jesus , let 's fucking go .
let 's just get it over with .
open the fucking safe !
this is agent martinez requesting immediate backup
but your kids ?
that 's the right move , you putting your kids first .
i didn 't put them first . i did this for me .
thanking you . thanking some man holding the door .
thanking jimmy .
and with all that , i never walked a day on the streets
it 'll be a cold day in hell before that
i was just about to make my decision
a closet doesn 't get installed in this town
it 's all about the songs .
whatever it is , it needs to be truth .
brother , i write love songs , to god .
sometimes to a girl .
so , yeah .
yeah
but to be honest with you ...
but i have to believe there 's a reason .
it will all be worth it .
you 're so good at it .
in one story . god grants healing
because each is a chapter in a bigger story .
each is the light of one star helping to form a galaxy .
i had my miracle .
it was enough
even when we can 't see .
all right , just this once you may close the door .
oh , damn it .
priya , this is your brother .
would you be sleeping over again this evening ?
actually , he can .
if a woman 's father is not around ,
there it is , priya . we 're indian .
my point is , you can 't go out with leonard .
my sister .

i got a job for you .
but it 's gotta be done by the morning

you 're fucking with me , right ?
this is for your own sake , right ?
that 's right .

i know . otherwise i would 've put in for one a long time ago .
what 's her apartment number ?
two tactical units are heading inside now .
why do you think i saved you a front-row seat ?
go out the nearest exit
e 's not in here .
you can 't ever pull that trigger . you understand me ?
we get everybody to go back to the edge of the perimeter ..
we 'll go to your uncle eddie 's house .

will you give us a minute ?
don 't you understand ?
she 's gonna lob it at you like a grenade .
i know .
we 've been over this .
you don 't have a violent bone in your body .
why won 't you let me help you ?
but you gotta let me deal with this . ok ?
however the fact that you discharged a deadly weapon during the commission of the crime
it says here that you 've requested to be incarcerated
the closest level one facility to ...
that 's maximum security . your honor .
we ain 't got all day to get this done .
move it . you got less than five minutes to take a shower .
let 's go . move , move .
never thought about it
man killed the vp 's brother .
which means no one up this river is more dangerous than him
oh , no the only time those boys get out is for chapel and p.i .
may 11th . that 's the date , man .
i know .
the evidence says you did .
you got nothing i need .
my mistake .
wouldn 't think you 'd find the daughter of frontier justice frank working in a prison .
i believe in being part of the solution , not the problem.hm .
nothing . that was just my senior quote .
this whole time i was thinking it was gandhi .
sit tight .
so , how do we play this ?
nice try .
no . honey , no
i just can 't help thinking this is about ..
i love you .
" passion " ? what were you thinking ?
she probably thinks i went sissy up in here .
one-syllable sucre .
" yes , " " no , " " love " " hate .. " " love . "
" yes , " " no . " " love , " " hate ... " " love . "
no one gets an audience with the pope .
top of your class at loyola .
i can 't help wondering what someone with your credentials
i gave him a shot when i got back from college . i did .
you ever think maybe he was hurt that you left in the first place ?
whatever it is you 're doing , don 't do it .
i told you to leave alone
you wanna do something ?
nobody 's trying to bury him .
the evidence was cooked .
take care of yourself .
something more is going on here .
gentlemen .
it 's our understanding that you have great influence with the governor .
we 're friends .
i 'm a man of god . how could i not ?
they won 't provide anywhere near the sheer strength
you want it by when , june ?
you gotta realise who 's getting punished
i did the same thing .
look where it got me .
i already screwed up that chance long ago
wouldn 't want to mess with the catholic roots , would we ?
you 've been checking up on me .
i went to northwestern.graduated two years after you did .
i love you .
sucre tells me you 're the local pharmacy .
fugnac .
standard over the counter variety.you can get it at any pharmacy .
i can 't get it at medical .
because they 're giving me insulin shots .
the company 's in trouble . i 'm losing my grip .
ii is difficult for a child to come to terms with it
i just can 't get through to him anymore .
the police have been involved . i 'm losing him .
i 'm here for ken , and i 'm here for you .
when the time is right , your son will return to you ...
you 've seriously gotta work on your english .
ryu !
atta boy , ryu. don 't let him push you around .
after their uneasy beginnings ..
a special bond through years of training together .
i 'm going through with it . i 'm gonna tell him .
well
ken , we need to prepare ourselves .
if you don 't wanna go , it 's fine . i 'll just go on my own .
better come and make sure you don 't get into trouble .
what town ?
we have a mission to complete , remember ?
i 'm just trying to broaden your horizons .
by knowing where we have come from
master gouilkxen ?
tatsumaki senpu-kyaku ...
and hadoken !
in the muscles of your legs .
whilst doing this , you must simultaneously concentrate .
as it reaches the moment of impact , the hado consolidated into your fist .
shoryuken. damn it .
how are you supposed to stay calm and without anger in the middle of a fight ?
good ryu , you are close .
we just want to watch .
it 's not for the faint-hearted
he 's big , but he lacks technique .
who you 're calling kid ? 10.000 says i 'll lay you out in the ring
but 15 grand says my boy here takes out your champ over there first .
it 's okay , ryu , you got this guy .
just finish him quick before he kills you . no holding back .
e wants his son to come home
you can never just meet me halfway , can you ?
you 're here because of the company , aren 't you ?
what do you say ? come on . it 's time to come home .
he and the company can wait a bit longer .
i 'm proud of you , ken . you made a brave choice , the right one .
it helped him to get back on top of things .
what has goki done to you ?
how could things get to this point ?
it was not my fault .
tn his own time . let him be .
no more lost than you are .
are you from the monastery ?
this little one i found wandering in the woods .
hello , my child . what is your name ?
if he has a voice , i couldn 't ind it .
it will still hurt
that would have been good to know last night .
actually , this lesson can wait
so you popped your hado cherry . how do you feel ?
how 's your arm ?
they are not your concern .
now leave this place !
well , then i shall be waiting
that kanji ... master , who was that ?
" on the field of battle , there is no friend or foe , "
what do you know of war ?
you will never understand
it is the only way i can reach my full potential .
why ?
look at you .
yet you think you can master its greatest prize ?
the path of the shin oni drives me .
i know you don 't want to hear it .
i miss him too ,
just forget him ?
i still feel you should have done more .
he has chosen a path which no one can follow him on .
this stops now .
what do you mean ?
no , not yet .
i must become stronger .
for two years i have trained in nothing but satsui no hado ,
my training under him is coming to an end .
you 're leaving ?
when i return , i will be the master of this house .
what did my uncle say ?
i must have been dreaming ..
think i felt satsui no fado .
beyond the mountains , deep in the valley ,
he hasn 't been heard from for over two years .
you taught us that it was myth .
that one would become completely consumed by it .
it may well have been the death of goki .
something more darkly powerful than i have ever encountered .
i don 't know ,
one master must seek out another and destroy him ,
i 'd rather just stay and finish my painting
no good can come of remaining here .
i pray that you may one day forgive me .
this makes me proud .
there is little left i have to teach you ...
your remaining time will pass quicker than you think .
you old son of a bitch .
i 've finished your song . i play for you now .
shut up , woman . i didn 't ask you to sing over ryu 's song .
it 's perfect .
thank you . i love it .
come on , boys . unload the truck .
cool , it 's from my dad .
i said i 'll play with you , come over here .
help me , help me . when did i ask you to kill me ?
in time
be strong
satsui no fado .
this fight is not over .
i don 't know what 's got a hold of you , but if you can 't snap out of it .
ryu .
calm yourself . it 's okay , ken . he 's awake .
it 's alright , man .
keep it . a memento of our battle .
at the end of the fight , there was an intense feeling of dark hado .
you promised me . i need to know .
look at your hand , ken .
i 've never taught you , never seen before .
ken , no excuses , no lies .
sensei , it wasn 't ken . i think it was me
you know , i was all ready to get out of here .
new people , new experiences , new challenges .
like sensei says , enlightenment through combat .
we 've come far together , ken .
thanks for everything , sensei . i 'm gonna miss you .
go and show the world what you 're made of . now get going
you guided me towards the buddhist path ..
when all i knew was turmoil and rage .
yes .
you have dutifully served my master 's household ...
you are relieved of your services to me .
thank you .
no , i like hanging , out
yeah , i want to go .
hey , would you tell me the truth ?
that 's not funny .
might as well be a map to shangri-la .
i know what you 're thinking , major .
you mean , you couldn 't do it ?
there is no way out of the infection zone .
you might as well get used to it , major .
i won 't lose any more people .
really ?
well , if that 's the best you 've got , major ,
i 'm afraid i 'll have to love you and leave you .
you don 't. you don 't even have to take me with you .
can you do it ?
you know , maybe there is ,
i believe in my mission .
look , you 're gonna have to go outside if you want to keep this up .
just not so soon . i mean , my career and
it 's real old . it 's been sinking in the mud forever .
betrayal !
have you seen that girl ?
everything they say about communists is true . dirty and stupid .
come !
your majesty .
this is heaven street , your new home .
rudy .
stay outside , you filthy saukerl .
do you like to run ?
go on . read one word . read something
i bet that wasn 't your first fight .
since he peed in tommy muller 's lunchbox .
jt was a draw
oh , my god .
i have to get home .
i have to 20 inside .
what do you want ? my permission ?
where have you been ? you 're late .
nein , mama . rosa
and don 't forget to count the money .
are you sure ?
all here
if they could have shown me his body , i would have believed them .
a mother never gives up on her child .
do you think my mother really loved me ?
even hitler 's .
do you think she writes to him ?
he can 't just walk around .
because people will see in .
why ?
cosa .
tried to make it as comfortable as i could .
if anyone saw , you know ?
make sure you knock first .
promise .
now you know what you 've been missing out on .
nein , papa . please .
you can stay a little longer .
i 've made you a christmas gift .
open it .
is he going to die ?
i won 't have that talk in this house . do you understand ?
just so that he could die .
why is it your fault ?
why did we build it ?
you said you weren 't going anywhere , max .
" through a biting wind and a driving snow .
until he dies'
" but things were out of his control .
i know you 're up to something .
what are you doing ?
it 's freezing , rudy . you 'll die in there .
rudy steiner .
what do you want with him ?
e starts in the summer
together , they sat in the forest .
and as he disappeared back into the shadows
my girl .
i can 't hear properly .
don 't stay up too late , you two .
so i had better get started .
but i know this al started with a train
und on a place called heaven street ...
until the sun forgot what his face was .
for max , who gave me eyes .
i 've always quite liked the image of me with a sickle and cape .
unfortunately , i 'm far more ordinary and commonplace .
it was a misread on a map .

in my bathroom ?
and the one before that .
president lincoln , sir ?
we saw you at , we .
i reckon it 's the speed that 's strange to me ,
i don 't want to be spared if you aren 't !
perhaps it 's ...
you dream about the ship before a battle , usually .
beyond description .
you don 't care about parties .
i know .
it 's not wilmington port , it 's not a military campaign !
why else would you force
don 't , don 't waste that power
i knew you 'd forget .
you needn 't tell me i 'm right , i know i am .
she needs this for the grand reception .
good night .
me too , taddie . but we can 't .
willie 's gone . three years now . he 's gone .
that 's my speech .
from mississipp 's winding stream and from new england 's shore .
even if every republican in the house votes yes ,
only twenty ?
we can find twenty votes .
with the amendment ,
president lincoln says the war won 't stop unless
if they run out of bullets and men ,
jeff city ? that 's , congressman burton ?
republican .
perhaps you could call on him and inform him of your enthusiasm .
if the rebels surrender next week ,
and , why is that ?
spare me the indignity of actually speaking to democrats .
pardon me , that 's a distress signal
you had nightmares all night , mama 's right to ..
perhaps .
you know who you 've got to see .
ask preston blair can i call on him around five o 'clock
oh . you don 't mind , boy , do you ?
they taught me a song !
soldiers know all manner of songs .
he 's at school now ,
good he 's not in the army !
leo , it 's a hundred miles to richmond .
yes ma 'am .
oh . thank you .
where 's my hat ?
all right ? go make peace .
we 'll commence our assault on wilmington from the sea .
was the boy playing with it ?
this is an official war department map !
now here 's where it gets truly slippery .
but the south ain 't a nation .
so if in fact the negroes are property according to law ,
we finish the deed now , we can 't wait !
on the 31st of this month . of this year .
whalers ?
the man 's never been near a whale ship in his life !
he-he ... he drags his feet about everything ,
come december you 'll have the same in the house .
i imagine we 'd rejoice to see that .
if we pass it , which we won 't .
we all know what he 's doing , and we all know what he 'll do .
he 's said he 'd welcome the
you said
i 've never trusted the president . i never trust anyone .
no , mr. stevens , he hasn 't .
therefore nothing about you is surprising .
it 's late , i 'm old , i 'm going home .
leader of the god forsaken republican party , our party .
retain , even in opposition ,
well , will he be unhappy if we lose ?
if that squirrel-infested
the house recognizes fernando wood ,
the new york delegation 's looking decidedly uninspired .
his emancipation
who 's the sweaty man eating his thumb ?
perhaps he 'll jump .
jesus !
we are once again asked ...
which , if passed , shall set at immediate liberty
every member of this house ...
looks like he ate a bad oyster .
a point of order , mr. speaker , if you please ?
when will mr. wood
we shall oppose this amendment ,
slavery is the only insult to natural law ,
you unnatural noise .
you are out of order !
instruct the sergeant of arms to suppress this !
please don 't encourage this !
you 're back , you 're back , you 're back , you 're back !
here , help me get one of these to my room .
she 's asleep , probably .
no , sir , i don 't . no .
the good lord on high would despair of their souls .
we 've abandoned these 39 to the devil that possesses them .
charles hanson .
nelson merrick .
and lastly ...
t-tax collector for the western reserve , it ...
don 't just reach for the highest branches ,
uh , boats , they-they make me sick .
let the assistant assistant port inspector 's stomach go weak .
he 's selling himself cheap , ain 't he ?
scatter ' em over several
might as well let ' em in .
my associates report that among the representatives ,
not without consulting me , you wouldn 't ..
january 11
we 'll hear ' em out .
and next the democrats
oh , the blairs promise , do they ?
what hope for any democratic votes , william ,
it 's either the amendment or this confederate peace ,
what do you think their families think about me ?
i can 't concentrate on british mercantile law ,
it 's a sturdy profession ,
i ain 't wearing them things , mr. slade ,
you 're delaying , that 's your favorite tactic .
now we 're working together , and i 'm asking you ...
when the people disagree ,
long and hard for the good of the people
the people elected me ! to represent them !
i admire your zeal , mr. stevens ,
you claim you trust them .
you know that the inner compass
a compass , i learnt when i was surveying ,
what 's the use of knowing true north ?
make time to talk to robbie .
too young for the army .
don 't take robbie .
go away ! we 're occupied !
they cannot possibly maintain under this kind of an assault .
fort fisher is a mountain of a building , edwin .
to bring this down ?
it 's gruesome !
this fight is for the united states of america .
they 're not lazy . they 're busily buying votes !
before this blood is dry , when stevens next takes the floor ,
george , please . stay on course .
i can ensure that every
although i 'm disgusted by slavery
we must consider what will become of colored folk
that 's what 'll become of them !
too publicly against us . he can 't change course now .
bless my eyes , if it isn 't the post master
your prostitution .
a deal is a deal and you men know better than to piss your pants
my neighbors in nashville ,
you do right , clay hawkins
wait ! ! you wanted , what was it , tax man for the western reserve ,
eleven votes ? !
there are defections in the richmond
ask the horse what he thinks .
there 'd be no sixteen year old boys left .
just read me back the last sentence of that telegram , please .
" have captain saunders convey the gentlemen
say you believe
or you risk it all .
do you or do you not hold that the precept that
to promote your ultimate and ardent dream to elevate ..
now you have always insisted , mr. stevens ,
i don 't hold with equality in all things ,
you believe that negroes are entirely equal to white men .
for shame ! for shame !
how can i hold that all men are created equal ,
how dare you !
and so again , sir , and again and again and again i say :
mr. president ..
what 's the matter , bob ?
and i will do it and i don 't need your permission to enlist .
" i don 't need your damn permission , you miserable old goat ,
or i will feel ashamed of myself for the rest of my life .
and not just to other people , but to myself .
but i don 't want to be nothing .
city point 's away back from the front lines , from the fighting ,
a sniper , or a shrapnel shell , or typhus !
and if the slaughter of cold harbor is on your hands same as grant ,
just , just this once , mrs. lincoln ,
the child who was not only sick
oh but your grief , your grief , your ..
inexhaustible grief ! how dare you throw that at me ? !
i ought to have done it ,
do it ! don 't you threaten me ,
i couldn 't tolerate you grieving so for willie
and i still do .
don 't speak to me about grief .
and ... bear what we must , hold and carry what we must .
may lighten this burden ,
and since you are sending my son into the war ,
no one has ever lived who knows better than you
because if you fail to acquire the necessary votes ,
i know you 're concerned .
god will see to it .
he may wish he 'd chosen an instrument for his purpose
are you afraid of what lies ahead for your people ?
white people don 't want us here .
i assume i 'll get used to you .
what my people are to be , i can 't say .
i never heard any ask what freedom will bring .
as for me .
wearing the union blue .
i 'm his mother .
what else must i be ?
why are you here ? no offense , but mr. seward 's
oh , you 've got no cause to be encouraged ,
" we have heard the chimes of midnight , master shallow . "
the patronage jobs simply won 't bag ' em .
do me a favor , will ya ?
i snagged my eye in the paper this morning ,
district . what a joy to be comprehended .
send latham . or schell .
y-yes sir , we sit only three desks apart .
a republican , and you , coughdrop , are a democrat ?
um , that is to say , i ...
i can 't accomplish a goddamned thing of any human meaning
we 're stepped out upon the world 's stage now , now !
blood 's been spilt to afford us this moment !
yes . but how ?
i am the president of the united states of america ,
we welcome you , ladies and gentlemen ,
on the matter of the joint resolution before us ,
i 've just received
the conservative faction of border and western republicans
quick , man ! quick !
word for word , this is precisely the assurance
give this to mr. ashley .
could you please just step outside ? !
making false representation to congress is ...
we won 't know ourselves anymore .
we have no legal basis for that discussion .
if they escape , leave the country while my back 's turned ,
by outward appearance ,
i never seen the like of it before . what i seen today .
you always knew that ... what this was going to be .
you must 've needed to see it close
and we 've won the war .
you 've an itch to travel ?
to the west by rail .
of course , had he known what she was about to do to his life .
dh season 4 episode 1
or a recently diagnosed tumor .
regardless , it 's all they will think of .
carlos .
uh , she left a note which pretty much blames me .
i can 't believe this is happening .
yes , but the good news is she 's gonna live .
oh , crap .
i just got married .
gaby you just said you don 't feel like victor really loves you ,
edie tried to kill herself tonight .
i found her just in time , but obviously , i can 't come pick you up tonight .
in a few weeks ? what ?
victor 's in the bedroom right now waiting to consummate .
susan !
you haven 't changed a bit .
how 's your aunt ?
i feel so lucky to have you for a neighbor .
look at my view .
and that pine tree in the backyard .
oh , it absolutely kills me to have to ask you to cut it down .
the nice thing about this fake pregnancy is my feet don 't swell .
bree !
but i 'll be gentle .
perhaps i need to make my point a little more clearly .
is there a problem here ?
i 'm just saying hello to a very dear friend of mine .
i don 't know , but you 've got to stop roughing them up .
dr.gorenberg just had a patient go into labor .
sure .
doctor ?
i don 't need any test !
now i don 't know what kind of nonsense they taught you at .
oh , my god !
just give me the damn test .
if the sheriff comes , we will drive him away with our bows and arrows .
i 'm feeling a little .
i beseech thee !
i said i didn 't then you changed your mind .
that 's not gonna happen .
if you wanna have kids , you might wanna jump on it right now .
it 's okay .
surely not over food .
you know , and this whole thing has just brought us closer together .
hello . i don 't think we 've met .
gaby , the woman tried to kill herself because i left her .
neither am i !
mommy has to conserve her energy for more important things .
how many more mishaps are we gonna get away with :
pretty soon , this whole charade will completely unravel , and we will be humiliated .
well , that 's not true .
you held something back because you knew what we were up to .
an audition .
doesn 't matter . you failed .
but your deception was obvious .
he 's not gonna check every compartment .
listen . every man for himself .
hi , daddy . hi , dad .
good . okay , i guess .
yeah . when are you coming home , dad ?
why ?
grandma says you 're never coming back .
are you offering me a choice ?
then you do have a choice .
tell the crew where you want to go .
how would you like to go home ?
you can 't fix that . no one can .
building a dream from your memory ...
is that what happened to you ?
this has nothing to do with me , understand ?
hey , get off of her . back up . back up .
get off of her !
it 's versatile .
thank you very much .
now , before you bother telling me it 's impossible , let me
hmm . arthur . you still working with that stick in the mud ?
oh , he 's the best , but he has no imagination .
listen , if you 're gonna perform inception , you need imagination .
we tried it . uh , we got the idea in place , but it didn 't take .
no , it 's not just about depth .
cobb , do the others know ?
you 've gotta warn them if this is getting worse .
i need to get home . that 's all i care about right now .
because they think i killed her .
" i will split up my father 's empire . "
the subconscious is motivated by emotion , right ? not reason .
how do you translate business strategy into emotion ?
robert 's relationship with his father ...
... so they 'd turn and smile and i could see ..
right now or never , cobb .
i realize i 'm gonna regret this moment ..
if i get on this plane and you don 't honor our agreement ..
complete the job en route ..
.... you have no trouble getting through immigration .
oh , yeah , absolutely .
excuse me , i think this is yours ? you must have dropped it .
oh . water , please .
um ...
you know , i couldn 't help but notice .
all right , third and market . snappy .
it 's not .
maybe not . can you pull over and get this ?
come on .
you might at least drop me at my stop .
down ! down now !
this wasn 't in the design .
get him !
yeah , i 'm okay . i 'm okay .
this was your job , goddamn it ! this was your responsibility !
we are not prepared for this type of ...
we 'll be more careful and we 're gonna be fine !
put him out his misery .
cobb , hey , hey .
no . it won 't wake him up .
not from this .
right . so , what happens when we die ?
are you serious ?
i am sitting this one out on this level .
ten hours of flight time is a week at this level .
that i can guarantee you .
no , he never gave me any combination .
well , what , then ?
you feel that ? you 've actually been trained for this , mr. fischer .
none of this is real . you 're in a dream .
.. is to try and remember how you arrived at this hotel . can you do that ?
no , breathe , breathe . remember your training .
i was sent here to protect you in the event ..
and i believe that 's what 's going on right now , mr. fischer .
okay .
right away . follow me .
jesus christ ! what are you doing ?
if you want my help , you have to remain calm .
if this is a dream , i should just kill myself to wake up , right ?
i believe they have you sedated , and if you pull that trigger ..
it had something to do with , um ...
god , why is it so hard to remember ?
listen , it takes years of practice .
what is it , mr. fischer ? think !
they 're trying to extract a number from your subconscious .
we should try hotel rooms . what was the number , mr. fischer ?
five .
well , how will you know ?
and then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge ,
if it 's too soon , we won 't get pulled out .
it wouldn 't be very strong if it did .
are those projections his subconscious ?
are you destroying parts of his mind ?
you keep telling yourself that , but you don 't believe it .
what if you 're wrong ?
you keep telling yourself what you know .
what do you feel ?
i feel guilt , mal .
.. no matter how confused , that guilt is always there ...
that the idea that caused you to question your reality came from me .
what is she talking about ?
well , you know , she 's sort of new to this kind of work .
yes , well , she clean like rich girl .
this whole building is models .
when i lived in manhattan ,
you 're right . life is funny .
10j . here it is .
maybe he 's the abercrombie model from the christmas ad
hi , i 'm big bill .
what are you talking about ? she loves you .
i think she has a blonde spot .. for me .
man , why do i never get invited to parties like this ?
yeah , this building has a real shirt shortage .
i doubt it 's the abercrombie model 's apartment .
it 's addressed to " cleaning dood , "
so , do you think he sleeps in the nude ?
oh , oh , you 're the reason ?
you did . and who delivered the cupcakes this morning
i floated over there and got paid for the job that i got us
oh , no ! i am going to wake him up .
oh , see ? i can 't get away , because you 're the rock
this is cleaning job ,
what is all this ?
i 'm going to go wake the hot model up .
as usual .
what kind of question is this ?
i don 't know these people or this place .
i 'm just saying , it 's the appalachians .
especially my sister and danny .
gotta love therapy .
sally ?
.. i 'm pretty sure we can handle you , though .
this is huge !
they call this a spa ?
just let it roll off my back nowadays .
as i said , we weren 't expecting so many .
uh , no , no , it 's fine . really .
what is that ?
we 're really staying here ?
now you keep doing
fucking family .
like , you 're carrying them around everywhere .
just whatis a lovely coup e like you doing settling in hobb springs ?
well , nice for him , huh ?
you take one of these up there , do me a favor , show it around .
danny . we 've been looking all over for you .
take a look at this picture and tell me if i should be .
how could i not know any of these people ?
maybe your side of the family moved .
i think we just met your cousins .
i don 't know how to break this to you , man ,
you heard him !
we 've had a sorts stay here , including three presidents :
jefferson davis ?
he was just messing around . weren 't you , vic ?
families really tamed this land , they made it into something
ever been bow hunting , danny ?
i would like to keep it that way .
d on ' .
i 'm getting used to it .
your girl , she really didn 't want you to come .
that guy with the fancy car and girl to match .
not my company .
i lost a lot of people 's money .
i guess that 's when you find out who your real friends are .
maybe they think you owe them .
it was all so embarrassing .
bait your area .
you don 't wanna go after your prey .
most of it 's not mine anyway . ah !
who ? are you tripping ?
you sit right there .
now to get you out of those bloody things .
now , don 't you be that way . i patched up all my brothers
oi . fine
you just ..
t 'oni will be here any second , so .
you 're very important to us .
i had a bad feeling about this .
did you actually kill something ?
you actually ... yeah .
can i interest you in an herbal essence ?
you see one mountain monster man , and you go cold turkey .
nothing . give that to me .
oh , shoot !
sure , but .. see , bry ?
the rest of it is just simple business sense
don 't you fret , lover .
fried outlets
this would go a hell of a lot faster if we knew what danny had in mind .
we need keys to some of these places .
that 's for the lady . that 's for you .
it 's the family vintage .
it 's a place for our folk to gather from far and wide .
like your friends came with you .
god created both the lamb and the tiger .
both parts are perfect and necessary .
.. and that is also the artist 's nature .
after all , the poor lamb didn 't ask to die
but still the same red van . now all bloody .
now , that 's exactly what i thought .
your narcissism knows no bounds .
for me though , what was really sensational about the work
the dark light .
the ones i deal with tend to repent all over the place .
imagine a man walking down a street
we want to go up in the tower , mom .
yep , we are going up .
i 'll aim ..
excellent !
as you can see , this one was hit here
that 's why typically a good hunter would have
verge ?
i don 't feel so good , verge .
you want me to show you the way to the next whiskey bar ?
it appears at this depth .
and perhaps it 's more interesting to him .
but to be honest
no matter where you go
i actually net sad when i think about it .
women are always the victims , right ?
told you before , this is private property .
all the king 's horses and all the king 's men
who 's stupid ?
l 've also killed men .
well , the stories i 've told were selected at random , but .
it turns you on , doesn 't it , jack ?
not physically , they 're just easier to work with .
to kill , you mean .
mr. sophistication believes in that theory .
thereby , it 's neither particularly good nor evil
he argues quite well that the ultimate goal
verge , you 're a bitter old bastard .
may i illustrate now ?
i don 't have a handle on how many processes take part
the three most common forms of decomposition are
albert speer invented " the theory of ruin value "
hubris is punished by nemesis
this talk about the value of ruins
the screeching sound .
poor design , please .
no one who heard it in action will ever forget that sound .
known as jericho 's trumpet .
hey , yeah . we 're just talking about the trip .
you have a plan ?
he 's .. he 's just gonna collect tiny spoons
i 'm not collecting tiny spoons .
okay , well ..
by the way , travel tip :
will do .
the grandma thought that i was a ghost .
thank you all for coming out
thank you , miss parker , for having me .
and thank you , spider-man .
thank you !
i was a little stiff . i felt like i wasn 't in the pocket .
yeah . i actually think you were a little stiff .
why don 't you want to talk to him ?
you sent nick fury to voicemail ?
you don 't send nick fury to voicemail .
you do not ghost nick fury .
after my trip .
no , no , he 's not ghosting you .
are you the head avenger ?
uh , no , i 'm not .
does anyone have neighborhood questions ?
what 's it like to take over from tony stark ?
what ?
italians created it , and i discovered it .
that 's the thing . it can means a million things .
i don 't know and get out of my face .
oh , so you 've been drinking espresso ?
a rose for you .
we 're talking about an eternal inflation system .
it 's insane .
don 't ever apologize for being the smartest one in the room .
they were born in stable orbits within black holes .
the science division had a technical name .
like thor .
these myths are threats .
we mobilized and fought them ,
all we did was delay the inevitable .
so thank mr. beck for destroying the other three .
the strongest of them all .
it 's the one that took my family .
and it will be in prague in approximately 48 hours .
and you 're coming with us .
i 'm sorry , man . i have to .
okay , put your one foot in front of the other ,
you missed them .
what ?
yeah , so why are we here ?
i 'm home .
the squeaky wheel gets the upgrade grease .
no , i was sick . remember ?
you know , susan yang thinks you 're a male escort .
well , then you 're spider-man .
look , i know you have a lot of questions ,
you took everything from me !
pause .
yeah , can you just fast-forward to the end ?
all right , fly , fly , fly , zap , zap , zap .
kill image .
all right , weapons .
let 's save the world , people .
you 're an fos now . " friend of spider-man . "
but it 's fake , so , there 's nothing to worry about .
great work , guterman .
i have a fake id ,
if it wasn 't for those stupid videos ,
i saved us , guys .
i faced a lot of deception .
so it 's time for the truth to be out there .
yes .
if carlos 's mother dies , there is no statute of limitations .
shut up !
how could it be murder ? it was an accident !
but we can 't sell it .
we 'll take the car to a bad pant of town ,
anyone could have hit mrs. solis .
bree , are you sure ?
i was up all night reading statistics on line .
i hope whoever hit juanita gets put away for life .
an innocent woman gets hit by a car and the driver just takes off ?
you should go home and get some rest , eat something .
carlos , i can stay here with your mother .
you can 't go on ike this .
what if she dies ?
why would i steal from you ?
i hear you bitching on the phone to your bank .
i can put up with your debauchery and your food theft , but i will not tolerate spying .
you don 't mean that .
i 'm leaving tomorrow to visit my sister for a few days .
i 'll do you one better .
i hope this works .
i 'm up all night , and then dozing off during the day .
i plan to stop , but right now , i need to sleep ,
i know you 're not .
hmm , sounds like a job .
um , yeah . uh ...
what time do you want me to be ready ?
well , what ? realistically , i 've known this guy a few weeks .
if you really think that , why are you going on a trip with him ?
so have the police come up with any leads ?
they 'll be able to determine the make and model of the car ,
no change .
we put her on our prayer list at church .
good boy . bongo !
andrew , um ..
you know , if you ever need to talk to anybody ...
yeah , well , it doesn 't .
no , i won 't . not until you tell me .
because i need to know that you 're not a monster .
yeah .
i feel bad that she got hurt ,
hold on a minute .
are you a drug dealer or something ?
well , i wouldn 't know , because you never let me in .
i have a gun for protection . i keep cash for emergencies .
you know , weird , creepy secrets , that 's another .
well , maybe we shouldn 't be dating .
do you mean that ?
lynette !
i hope the kids aren 't too much for danielle to handle .
i don 't know , but i 'm scared .
lynette , honey ?
so if i confess , it 'll clean the slate , right ?
if you want god 's forgiveness , you have to be truly sorry ,
i wouldn 't recommend waiting . what if you die before then ?
i do yoga , i eat well .
gobrielle .
don 't you want to be a good person ?
that 's the answer of a selfish child .
then i started taking the pills because they gave me energy ,
i 'm so sorry they have me as a mother .
no , i 'm not .
i 'm so tired of feeling like a failure .
no , it 's not .
thanks for shopping at zed mart .
thanks . and watch your language .
andy , i told you to unpack those boxes .
i wanted to make a mental map
hey , have you seen rooney ?
why is the door being left open ?
you hungry ? what do you want ?
andy .
why ?
there 's a bow on its head .
we saw the signs , and we did nothing !
that 's all . don 't be influenced by him .
yeah , ' cause i can cook .
and we are gonna ..
and we are gonna open it on his birthday .
never .
oh , my god , moms , right ?
you know , this neighborhood has a lot of bad influences .
people like to keep their mouth shut .
you know what i mean ?
when you get a bit older and you start to realize that it 's just .
that is fantastic .
check this out . hey , chode .
hey , master . wanna go get a burger ?
buddi 2 will be available in five model designs .
yo , omar , check it out , dude .
the new model isn 't even out yet ,
when buddi imprints on your child ,
back farther . back farther . there .
what 's so funny ?
ugh , ugh !
which sounds great , but for me ,
to me , the perfect way to spend summer vacation
the real problem is , me and my dad have nothing in common .
i think i have a shot at a fun summer .
my dad has this crazy idea
my dad has his eye on me , so the key to a successful summer ...
i 'm sorry . did you say something ?
it 's the first day of vacation .
actually , that 's exactly what i thought .
back then , tingy was a fluffy blue blanket .
you don 't think he cares anymore ?
what ?
my dad and i don 't agree on anything , except for ...
we both hate it . but we can 't stop reading it !
it 's not even a joke !
this is important .
you need to get to greg 's level and really engage with him .
i have nine hundred and forty-nine e-mails ?
i have to get out of here !
please check the number and dial again .
911 . what is the nature of your emergency ?
hello ? are you hurt ?
i don 't think so .
yes , officers ?
what ?
you can never trust me again .
rowley , i get it . you didn 't want to hurt my feelings .
that 's all right .
so what about the gig ?

in a few weeks , she should start to feel better .
it was soft . absolutely , it was soft in that first ..
how did that happen ?
and he would just order the most complicated drinks .
one night , he climbed over the bar
and you went .
and watched me while i made drinks .
then he stared at me like i was a painting .
taucht me how to ski .
proposed to me in maui that winter and we were married by spring .
that was five vears ago , so i was 23 .

i had to stop seeing her when they took our house away
no , of course not .
she didn 't just have the rug pulled from under her ,
even her health insurance . she moved into the city to find work
why is that ?
she says you tried her on medication .
really struggled . mmm .
jh . well , maybe she 's a candidate for one of these newer meds .
i put her on ablixa .
we 'll be starting the presentations soon ,

a week ago . oh !
i 'm sorry ! i can 't , i 'm sorry .

but hazlitt says i have the inside track .
emily .

no . i just , um ...
and i was like when i was in the car .
you 're going to go to work after ?

we had an appointment last night that she didn 't show up for .
any idea why the dinner table was set for three , dr. banks ?
no , she didn 't have children .
for depression , right ? i 've seen the ads .
i 'd like to speak to her , if that 's possible .
it 's possible , you see , that she was asleep .
she walks in her sleep .
she 's had other episodes .
stand up , please . and turn around .
and before you answer that
well , this goes one of two ways , doesn 't it ?
in which case , you 're the target of a bid civil suit .
this is different .
i never want to see another pill again .
another pill to help me sleep .
i don 't think so .
i killed the wrong person .
jon . you can 't follow them around
i think they 're going to charge her .
ou said she has no memory . no criminal intent .
a man in arizona .
woke up the next morning , no memory of it .
neighbors even saw him throw the body into the pool .
a woman bludgeoned her husband while on vacation in sanibel island .
i assumed as much .
t know you are , but if she goes away ,
she ever talk about killing her husband ?
you spoke to any of the family ?
we need your help .
a patient of mine was arrested .
yeah . pretty bad .
no , not at the moment .
i have no comment . she 's my patient . that 's all i can say .
i saw some press people downstairs .
is that for you ?
my wife never liked me coming here .
it 's going to be a " thing . "
i 'd really like to focus more on what 's going on with you .
no . you 're taking something else .
as part of the office 's medical conduct review ,
and expressed a desire to get better .
in addition , she had no history of violent behavior .
i didn 't think she posed a risk to others .
dr. siebert . hmm .
you also do work at the hospital , a number of shifts .
and you said you 're doing pharmaceutical consulting .
my wife lost her job .
i bought a new place downtown , too .
they can 't come after you for any of this , right ?
they don 't blame me .
like i was on that case with the kid from uganda
what makes us human ?
an awareness of what we 're thinking and what we 're doing .
and so , i go to the fridge and i make myself a sandwich .
yes .
objection , your honor .
she 's known me for a lot longer , and she could testify .
and you weren 't in her care at the time of the murder .
what if i say no ?
but they have a body , they have your prints on the murder weapon ,
you walk out of here on your own .
well , what do you think ?
it 's become a part of the environment here .
we had the state board here . it 's on the nightly news .
she 's going to hospital for observation . it 's behind us .
and us , too , if we 're standing next to you .
rational people may look at it like that ,
we shouldn 't even have to ask . you should see what 's happening .
why are they writing this ?
it never happened . look .
fad her perform oral sex in your car ?
depression can take away your energy .
a number of years ago .
came in here every week like he was going to confession .
it was about six or seven months later
and he was lying to me .
at times , i blamed me .
from the tests . it 's in the blood .
or the past , or the sadness ?
we were consulting on a patient , not comparing resumes .
it wasn 't about me , it was about emilv .
yeah , and she was carrying the seat belt .
yeah , i saw it !
who wouldn 't be depressed ?
oh , god , it 's just so tragic .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
that 's not me . it 's william styron . yes . william styron .
there are times when i feel i could have written it , but
excuse me . are you julia ?
but united fell 40 % after the planes crashed
thinking something 's going to happen isn 't illegal
sure , you do , but , look . see !
down . way down .
she did it . she made it happen , do you see ?
hopefully with this and the consulting money we can finally get back ...
they fired me .
i don 't want to hear about emily or alison .
no , it 's not making sense !
the case is over .
i just want to know what happened .
that 's what happened .
how does it do that ?
but you killed him .
no . i never would have hurt him . i loved everything about him .
his hands . everything about him . i loved .
like he did ?
stop ! it 's too late ! millions of dollars were made !
the verdict 's in . it 's too fucking late for whatever that circus is
we have double jeopardy laws in this country .
and that you lied to a woman
you were never here .
she wasn 't depressed .
oh . i did .
i think she requires more observation .
this is dr. siebert on bridge street .
a different course of treatment to pursue
saved . end of new messages .
you could get national coverage on this .
nice try , jon . i 'm not buying it .
because they 're coming to take it back .
you could go and ask her .
she told me evervthino .
none of the side effects you get with pills .
i also wanted to give you another test .
first saved voice message .
i 'm sure you 've received my latest notes
different course of treatment to pursue
wait . what is she saying ?
get off the phone . get off the phone !
get me dr. siebert ! this is bullshit !
relax ! relax !
yes . dr. siebert ?
i 've been thinking about our last conversation .
an idea occurred to me .
hello there ! best we don 't talk inside , right ?
uh , she wants to go before the judge this week .
well , it depends .
we needed everyone to see how much i wanted it to work out with us .
and how terribly depressed i was .
it 's not a decision you make just once .
and it all leads back to him .
and you think to yourself ,
was it because of alison finn ?
a convenient distraction .
it could have been you or anyone else
i think it started there .
you know , i get scared that people will leave and then
uh , i 'm sorry , zach , this is an emergency .
how much did you have to pay him to get me out ?
you didn 't leave me much choice .
two accounts .
god .
yes , i 'm sure .
do i look sad now ?
yeah .
oh , yeah .
please ?
i do not like it , but i have a very full schedule today ,
you will run every test i ask for .
this woman has lost a husband and a son in this hospital .
o 'malley ? george 's mother is our v.i.p. ?
as promised .
oh , you come over here and give me a hug .
i bet it never occurred to you
why ? do you need it today ?
uh , have you been experiencing any fevers at all , louise ?
yes , actually , i have .
i know . i 'm sorry .
you know how proud it makes me to have you as my doctor ?
go to seattle grace . they 'll take care of you . "
a doctor .
looks like columbia 's got a good match
my characters are my family ,
yes , i want to give my readers closure .
and i 'm the only one who can give it to ' em .
you want to help me ?
how fast can you type ?
i want to hear everything . how have you been ?
i-i got married .
ah , hunt . just in time .
can this just stay between you and me ?
now i 'm thinking . i must not be much of a teacher at all .
to prove to a judge that 's never met me that i 'm a good person ,
i 'm racking my brain for anything
but there 's a button missing , and it shows too much cleavage .
i 've got one shot at this .
and frustrated .
the lady of the lake appeared with a gilded scalpel
i 'm actually being serious right now .
first of all , i was 19 .
why don 't you just eat it like usual ?
hm ? what 's that ?
something 's glowing in the spring !
did you see that , hawk ?
you 're much more gentle , though .
you came here to find a way to save your land , right ?
what you 've started is not meaningless .
i wanted to save the kingdom of liones too .
you , too ?
everyone , prepare to land .
this is
what is the meaning of this ?
was that supposed to happen ?
the demon clan !
there 's so many of them !
the resurrection day was supposed to be much later !
we have the great ooink with us !
the ceremony will have to wait .
for our most precious wish !
what is that ?
name yourself !
descendants of the goddess clan !
your dirty little souls will all be devoured by me ,
awaken , o great beast !
i 'll head to the top of craggy peak .
oh , a flying captain leftovers .
hot , hot !
we 're saved !
i will be your opponent now .
you 're going to play with me , right ?
that 's one down !
how can you still be alive with needles all though your body ?
you wanted a hug , right ?
the six knights of black .
yet , you 're so lawless , even the demon lord abandoned you .
you bastard !
my skills have surpassed that of the ten commandments !
are you finished ?
how dare you hurt our friends !
won 't move ..
you 're up to no good , aren 't you ?
how could the captain lose ?
he 'll be okay , right , merlin ?
but this sword appears to be quite dangerous .
this is due to the hidden power of the winged sword .
this sword can only be handled by the head warrior .
solad ..
father !
you are all right ?
what about your injury ?
it 's said they even prey on the demon clan .
the time of ruin .
we 'd better revive the captain real quick and stop that monster .
you must not pull out that sword .
he is a demon ! a high-ranked one at that !
a demon was pretending to be solaad ?
master zoria ....
for 3,000 years , the winged sword has been passed down so that we can fight
countless lives have been lost in these battles .
do something , granny !
master zoria , the beast is headed this way !
i will follow suit !
the desire to protect people has nothing to do with laws .
it 's a bit late in the afternoon , but i still have plenty of power left .
i wanted to observe this exchange a bit longer , but
you can leave it to us !
you guys protect the women and children in the plaza !
you can die alongside the celestials !
no , the plaza !
we can 't let it get near the plaza !
new spirit spear chastiefol . second form .
fillet and roast !
you 're in the way !
master zoria , the seven deadly sins are battling the indura .
you too ...
i don 't deny that i was a coward .
i have paralyzed his sight .
you 're different from what i 've heard .
thank you for protecting this village while i was away !
after we get rid of that beast .
mum ! it 's just my bow .
leave her be .
mum ? you 'll never guess what i did today .
fire falls ?
what did you do , dear ?
hungry , aren 't we ?
i don 't want my life to be over .
but are you willing to pay the price your freedom will cost ?
if you could just try to see what i do , i do out of love .
i 'm just not ready .
i think i could make you understand if you would just ...
i 'll make you a deal for this rare prize .
it was sweeping by itself . that 's ridiculous .
i should know . i 'm a . whittler .
how about this conversation starter ? it 's made of yew wood .
that 's stuffed .
i didn 't know what to think . look at your dress .
well , you 're home now , so that 's the end of it .
mum !
how do you feel about the marriage now ?
all right , that 's fine . that 's just fine .
it 's good enough .
what ?
we 've been waiting patiently .
he 's got big giant paws !
it 's locked .
i propped it open with a stick .
for goodness ' sakes , maudie , would you get a grip ?
come on , mum . quick .
mum , we 've got to hurry .
go on and help yourself to anything you want , as a reward .
fate be changed ,
and thank you for shopping at the crafty carver .
welcome to the crafty carver ..
.. for all your ...
i 'm off to the wickerman festival in stornoway ...
we 'll sort it out tomorrow .
you 're the king .
none of your sons are fit to marry my daughter .
they 're gonna murder each other .
i know , i know !
shut it !
once there was an ancient kingdom .
that kingdom fell into war
aye , but it 's true .
it 's just a legend .
they ring with truths .
our stories are not yet legend .
our clans were once enemies .
you fought for each other .
my dad rallied your forces
but i 've been selfish .
there 's no one to blame but me .
watch your blade ! you 're going to take somebody 's arm off !
give me a hand over here !
i 'm doing all the pulling here .
done !
are you out of your mind , lass ?
i 'm so glad to see
molly , are you sure it 's all right ?
thank you .
yeah , hi . i think i left my keys here .

we all should have been safeguarding the utensil .
do you think he 's lost ?
what do we do , buzz ?
be right down .
whoa ! who 's this ?
that 's most likely where your forky is being kept .
we just can 't be seen by the dummies .
her cabinet is surrounded by a moat of exposed aisle .
yeah , he told me himself , he 's useless .
such pretty hair .
you need to stick to the plan .
can we go to the carnival , too ?
come on . stay quiet .
my sheep !
bo , i 'm so sorry . really .
you really wanna help ?
what about the others ?
it 's a commercial ! it 's not real !
it 's not fair !
okay , okay . calm down , duke .
right now , we need the only toy
you ever think about getting out there , seeing the world ?
no . you can 't teach this old toy new tricks .
so , how 'd you end up in this store in the first place ?
and i thought maybe you were inside
this is the only part of the store i ever liked .
for me ?
i am ?
i 'm gabby gabby , and i love you .
oh , what have you got there ?
you can take it home if you want .
what happened ? gabby was supposed to be her toy .
mom , it 's over here .
she came out to the forum ..
what did we say about talking like that ?
that i 'm not supposed to talk like ...
and you 're gonna apologize to pam , aren 't you ?
so you don 't remember .
no ? you went to pomona .
you went to a fair . you come see me in muskogee , boy
attractions . animals .
it 's different , though . i 'm not a clown .
it 's also the same too , motherfucker .
hey ! rocco !
it took away that cut-and-dried feeling , you know for a bit .
church ? god ? yes .
it 's bullshit , really . it 's ...
yes , you fuckin ' are , motherfucker !
get your own fuckin ' kid
give me the fucking ketchup .
come on .
we all know what to do in the hug circle , right ?
you can always come back here .
to this circle .
and that 's a tool we can use wherever we are
you can , actually .
well , maybe if you used this tool ,
like , you can 't you can 't tickle yourself ?
i 'm releasing all them hormones .
it 's my fourth time in rehab .
that 's how i ended up here
i think maybe you should go out into the woods
are you fucking with me ?
yeah .
get the fuck out of here .
i don 't know . i guess ...
wasting my fucking time .
the fuck you know about time ?
that was a good time to tell me she , uh , preferred women .
who was a mean-ass woman and an outrageous alcoholic .
just .. did not give a shit .
drama .
mother fell out of a window , landed on a freeway .
had alcohol and weed
i care about the fucking heart rate , okay ?
all right , heart rate man .
but all right , let 's go . ready ?
" as opposed to this ? "
shut the fuck up !
it 's 12 midnight . shut the fuck up .

oh , look at that . you 're gonna let it burn a hole in the carpet ?
you have good instincts .
i got rodeo clown instincts .
i like pussy too much .

not until you get this scene . you 're gonna make me laugh
give me a fuckin ' cigarette , dad .
you . who else is gonna give a felon a job ?
i have you to do that .
you chase the bullshit forever , man .
your mother says a whole fuckin ' lot of shit , your mother .
the real world
the only thing that 's gonna live on
i want stories .
well , you get stories every week .
you make your own stories .
for me to have my son talk to me
what other kind could you have with him ?
i love st. patrick 's day .
just slip one of these babies into your pants
and possibly a very unpleasant paper cut .
put me down for five .
can 't you just go with deke ?
i know , but he 's snowboarding somewhere called vail
this 'll hold us over till our 3 : 00 a.m. street meet ,
i miss my old st. patrick 's day tradition .
hell , no .
is this cab even moving ?
it 's the same one ,
if you touch my horn again , i cut your hand off !
do it . do it , if it 'll get us there faster .
and i 'm gonna need that for a junior king room
no , we won 't . we need that $ 356 .
it has to last till we 're 82 .
don 't worry , we 'll make more money .
damn it !
that means the parade 's over .
all right , i gotta move some t-shirts .
" kiss me i 'm irish " crotch tees . $ 15 .
you nobody !
that 's illegal . you need a permit !
i can 't believe you call yourself russian .
oh , now you 're gonna cut out my tongue ?
look , oh , my god , it 's earl !
10 for a picture , 15 for a kiss , nothing below the waist .
will you take a 20 ?
just so you know , if you 're an orphan , i 'm interested .
we 're just taking advantage of drunk people .
well , then maybe you can get them to take advantage of me .
max , are you eating chicken ?
i think i came out ahead .
please . i 'm feeling sick .
is that one of those famous irish poems too ?
just let her cut . it 's st. patrick 's day .
not to bring up my st. patrick 's day tradition at the plaza ..
but it was so much better than this place .
max , this is boring . what happened ?
now i 'm thinking maybe this wasn 't
'cause i feel like i got a text about it and ignored it .
well , that was quick . did you get properly fed ?
sure . we 'll see .
i just need my agent to call me back .
and we may disagree on what is considered fascinating .
why do you have mostly-used toilet paper rolls in the cabinet in your bathroom ?
there on the end .
you 'll be a very rich man .
i want to talk about it now !
well , that 's not unusual , our grandmother and grandfather were first cousins .
here , jersey girl .
so , you still have a balance , miss israel .
but she 's really sick and she 's very old .
didn 't you people take a hippocratic oath ?
god . wow .
all right , i have $ 14 .
no , we need half the balance .
okay . just these .
i don 't want the others .
i just don 't want to carry them around anymore .
i told you i don 't want the others .
you know , you don 't have to be so disrespectful .
just get it to me soon .
uh , hey , in the meantime ,
good afternoon , darling .
can i have a beer , pretty please ?
lee israel ?
last time i saw you ... thank you .
am i right ?
you 're friends with , um , julia some ..
yeah .
so , what do you think ?
i could give you $ 75 .
it 's a bit bland is all .
well , do you think you could pay in cash ?
i 'm glad to hear you 're writing another book .
did you hear tom clancy is getting paid three million dollars
i mean , the p.s. makes it priceless .
so , one of each , twice a day , in her food .
it 'll stabilize her .
oh , no , no , no .
yeah , it 's awful . i mean , there 's dead flies everywhere .
thanks .
i fear i must decline your invitation as this weekend
welcome .
i 'm aware that you sell memorabilia and first editions .
yes , all of that .
wondering if these might be of interest to you ?
my cousin was a collector .
you clearly don 't know me very well .
come on ! spill the beans !
i have no one to tell . all my friends are dead .
i can 't fathom what criminal activity you could possibly involve in ,
libraries ?
how much are you getting for them ?
it 's a waste of a secret .
who else have you told about this ?
no . i remember you had someone .
why ?
unlike you , i prefer to put my money to good use .
i just thought we should do something .
" baby won 't you say you love me "
but if you are tempted , make sure you do your homework .
some care more than others about getting the real thing .
that one .
you run your mouth too much .
too much .
let 's go to your place . come on .
oh ! it smells horrible .
what 's going on in there ?
miss israel .
thank you for those cookies .
ms. israel .
so , what do you got ?
she had quite the mouth .
liked the ladies , too , i heard .
i assume so .
and people love this stuff .
that is fucking old . what 's that in cat years ?
ms. israel , i was wondering if you could come in tomorrow ?
please come in or call as soon as you can .
thank you . thank you for bringing it in .
what seems to be the problem ?
and he said that ..
it was illegal in those days , and ...
i 'm shocked .
you mean , your cousin ?
i 'm not gonna do that to you . i 'm a good guy .
i 'll lie .
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
that 's very generous of you .
you 're a clever woman .
oh , hello , welcome .
my grandmother just died , and .
and i discovered these when i was going through her closet and
oh , yes .
i guess i 'm not really up on all these things .
do you think it 's real ?
good .
you brought it back , right ?
you left it there ?
stop calling me an idiot .
i 'm just gonna kill myself first .
lee , come on . we can 't stop now .
maybe you could steal more real ones
fair enough .
i 'm a very private person .
yes , i understand that most of you could barely speak a word .
arbanivicz , i do admire your conviction ,
considering the antique of their flight .

as well as live readings from local authors .
she loves mysteries , don 't you , honey ?
i 'm telling you , you really should look into it .
rose ridge doesn 't have anything that i can 't give her .
she burned your hand .

i 'm just trying to get to know you better . that 's it .

pickles .

study buddies should help each other out ,

the god kamadeva has shot us with his flowery arrows of love .

well , you know , actually that 's not the case .
and he 's never been to texas .
what ? in the chattahoochee national forest in georgia ?

when i adopted sherman , i vowed to be the best father i could be .
and so , sherman inspired the greatest invention of my life ...
get that dog !
it 's simple , sherman .
let that little keepsake be a reminder to you ...
that no matter what challenges you face ono matter how far away i-might seem .
that no matter what challenges you face , no matter how far away i might seem .
and when president washimoton was a little boy ..
what kind of tree did he cut down ?
penny ?
fel in .
it 's really great meeting you guys .
i could bring my new model . it 's a hydrogen atom .
guess we 'll have to split it .
check it , guys .
i 'm sure he must have had a reason .
quiet , purdy !
it 's not normal for them to bite .
in my opinion , a dog can never be a suitable parent to a little boy .
and the court can take it away from you .
and rather uncharacteristic , given how you feel about mr. gandhi
well , all right then .
try and get some sleep .
i have a deep regard for you as well , sherman .
an advisor to heads of state .
when i found sherman , it reminded me of how i started out in life .
a home
with all due respect , how hard could it be ?
if a boy can adopt a dog ..
da-dal ! ho sherman , not " da-da . "
" ' imf . pea-ba ba ,
" it snot my birthday . no , it isn 't .
it 's not father 's day . is it ?
aren 't we , sherman ?
say hello to penny , sherman .
fello , sherman .
i am so glad you accepted my invitation .
you 're barking up the wrong tree , mister . in fact ... .
and i have to tell you , peabody ...
hello . sure , i 'll take a survey .
because i could take it home , pretend to be sick .
mr. peabody says you should never use the wabac .
how come ? there would be two of you .
i guess the world 's not ready for that .
um , well , now that we 've seen it , maybe we should go back .
ancient egypt . land of the pharaohs .
but a cruel and barbarous civilization just the same .
are these barbarians bothering you ?
bows barbarians .
and laid in a pit of fire ants ?
anything , my desert flower . consider it a wedding gift .
anubis has spoken !
anubis , you sound unwell .
but i 'm feeling much better now .
home .
before penny 's parents realize she 's missing .
certainly not .
or , perhaps , i 'm just some old " giza . "
uh , what 's the matter . , mr. peabody ?
we 're going to have to make an unscheduled stop .
we have just enough power to make it to the renaissance .
how many times i got to tell you , mona lisa ?
i can 't paint the picture ..
leonardo , tell me one thing i have to smile about .
all the things that make italy such a popular tourist destination !
translated into perfect engineering .
because children are not machines , peabody .
oh ! it was creepy .
but i don 't want to fly !
no , seriously , penny , i don 't want to !
don 't let go !
i 've spent the last seven years teaching sherman good judgment .
is that true ?
no , sherman , i 'll never let that happen .
oh , dear , a black hole !
if i can 't pull us out of here .
thank you .
well , after a few failed experiments ... .
and constructed a rudimentary waba c
i just need to find a wormhole .
hey , i 'm walking , here !
there they go . don 't lose them .
but they all lead back to the present !
there he is . after them !
mr. peabody , you 're under arrest
you don 't understand
tot usually .
if we set the wabac for the future , and go very , very fast ..
oh , my ..
i 'd prefer if you didn 't smoke .
he hasn 't steered me wrong yet .
he can 't do it himself .
ex-mi6 , but he 's still an insider .
is that right ?
you should have left me alone .
they changed their plans so i could join them .
not because i couldn 't . because i ...
so they flew without me .
reza is an errand boy .
you get those sorted and you 're sorted .
your breathing as the bass .
good .
the heart blows out .
what ?
are you out of your mind ?
think of your heart as the drums .
massive blood loss ... clean through the body ...
oh , i heard you found a donor
shepherd on the front page of a national journal ,
you think they airbrushed his picture ?
could you focus ? i need you right now
congratulations .
it was not good at all
i-i tried , but it just felt so weird
what if. what if me and erica are
two girls getting nasty and loving it ? that 's hot .
is everybody clear on that ?
i don 't know .
okay. you 're busy i 'll be brief .
tonight ? you want to get together again tonight ?
fun .
your ankles are looking a little thick
sounds just like a real doctor
oh the chief has got me doing press all day with journalists .
uh-huh i already pushed that .
paying money for a kidney
would drop out .
that 's what would happen
you 're in the hospital giving a kidney to a stranger .
your kidney may not be going directly to my husband ,
all eyes are on seattle grace .
yes , sir .
we got to spend time with each other
so , yeah , nothing
if you could. just be patient a little bit longer
it wasn 't good for you .
something else will come up
we hadn 't spoken in over a year .
this was my chance to get him back .
i know p j. can be selfish
i worked late most nights .
you can 't blame yourself .
i guess you just try not to care too much .
these are , uh , your discharge papers .
it 's okay .
which makes me nothing years old .
caroline , are we still on for two boots pizza tonight ?
and just not because the city has demanded to
you can have one slice with two toppings
okay , everybody .
first , the guy who found the beak in his sandwich
what do you think ?
oh , really ?
it was my grandma 's from russia .
she passed customs , then she passed this .
well , it takes four years for these cars to be custom-made .
that 's right , my father ordered this for me
all my father ever gave me was that one iffy chromosome .
it 's all yours .
it 's all about healthy choices .
damn , someone painted the batmobile white .
that 's a $ 450,000 sports car .
and speaking of seconds ,
this is our getaway car .
is p. diddy here ?
no one cool owns it .
now , this is the kind of car
i just got off the phone with my dad .
turns out they won 't let me keep my present .
they bought you a boy ?
hmm .
all right .
law enforcement officials are following several leads in what authorities are calling
ike foster and john truby died at the scene .
at the press conference earlier today ,
715 : 01 released updated information regarding the alleged suspects .
you still think i 'm crazy ?
come on , let 's get you inside .
you think it was real , or do you think he was faking it ?
his brain imaging says it was real .
detective , this was the worst case i 've seen .
it took everything i had to hold him down .
i know this place .
that 's why we brought you here .
why don 't you get the equipment ?
all right , mac , let 's get you out of here .
one of the men who died in the shoot-out used to work here .
you brought us here .
why are we wasting our time with this bullshit ?
he 's rebuilding the story of his past .
i don 't trust him either .
is it somebody you worked with ?
my eyes .
not without negative side effects .
a river .
cement towers .
i got it .
i got him .
come on , come on .
no , there 's someone from law enforcement .
dreyfus .
they treat him like that because he 's jewish ?
a catholic officer would have had a fair trial .
he was denied due process on matters of national security
that could not be disclosed , but the evidence against him was not lacking .
with philippe i discovered an alsacian restaurant in rue marbeuf .
all right , carry on .
no secretaries , the colonel didn 't trust them .
a note on the hydraulic brake of the 120 and its functioning .
one on the changes to artillery units .
we recovered this one week ago at the german embassy .
probably in berlin .
what does the note say ?
he served in all four departments of the joint chiefs .
the guards are forbidden to speak to me .
the isolation is such that it feels like i am buried alive .
but it 's not just about my life , but my honor ,
it 's not a precautionary measure .
it 's a kind of torture . "
how long have you been there ?
are those letters ? love letters ?
it 's nothing , i assure you .
that 's an abominable suggestion .
of course !
i have nothing more to add on the matter .
enter .
good night .
leave the keys , i 'll do it .
" the germans have an officer informing them .
i paraphrased .
no , he 'd lie like everybody else .
have you told general gonse about this ?
it 's a small , very quiet section .
in the safe .
thank you . from now on if you don 't have any objections , i 'll take care of it .
this doesn 't stop here .
it warns us that esterhazy will be reported to the chamber of deputies
picquart !
this is an intolerable accusation !
nothing will stop you . i should arrest you for gross negligence !
i haven 't told anyone about the investigation and i 'm not obsessed .
what would you do if you had proof that dreyfus was a spy ?
how do you know that ?
the generals understood that i wouldn 't keep quiet .
later in marseille , algiers and tunisia .
i ended up in an african regiment .
they intercept my correspondence and i 'm being followed .
my god !
can you prove any of this ?
you have to make it public .
since i was 18 , the army is my life .
did you inform your superiors of this news ?
what did they say ?
major lauth , can you come closer ?
.. but you 're not a robot .
nope . definitely not to plan .
victory is ours . we won . we won .
not that again . you really still think it 's out there , don 't you ?
every thing here just seems so pointless .
who won
i know
you do like to clear your debts .
all i want is a recharge .
were you ?
now , let me see that .
the power for my cell is low again .
i 'd like to reboot your power-generator outs .
you know , you must 've been really something to see
everything changes . everything
i swear that 's your favorite part .
hey , whatever happened with that ?
i got the mechanical parts down , but the electronics are baffling
if you don 't realize it 's every man for himself .
done .
it looks okay .
not all of us would die for him . i wouldn 't
you should be okay now .
it 's matthews .
thanks .
i 'd tell you , but i wouldn 't wanna geek out on you .
i heard the drones lost the ability to identify friendlies .
didn 't stop you from taking out those drones , though .
that 's great .
et 's 20 search those drones for ammo .
how 's she look ?
she seems pretty tough to me .
she 's just trying to stay tough for their mission .
yes , they do .
it 's just that we 've been on the road for a while
you know , you 're awfully young to be mixed up in trouble like this .
fine , i get it . i get it .
and olson fixed your friend . so the way i see it , we 're even .
probably deserted since the war .
i 'm not sure if i should tell you .
is that why he 's helping us ?
are you a good cause ?
i hope so .
but he did and i wanna know .
oh , my god . i can 't believe it .
you 've been there . do you believe it 's what they say it is ?
without something like olympus , mankind will fall .
do you think they 'll be okay ?
you 're making me waste my ammo , you hunk of junk .
i 'm sick of his cat and mouse game .
stay here .
they 'll help you , i know it .
but you 're gonna survive this .
come on .
iris .
you 're not as innocent as you look .
all right . let 's get you out of this mess .
where 's olson ?
we make a good team .
we need to get out of here . let 's move .
walt . you have what you want . please , don 't kill him .
you 'll find that out soon enough .
we need to make sure he never actually finds it .
how many are we looking at ?
it looks , incomplete .
will it work ?
how did you know about it ?
the information about this weapon
he and i were sent from olympus to do postwar cleanup .
so futile and what a terribly misguided notion .
do you think he is still alive'
i thought you were dead .
and drlareos ?
oh , come on . what do you think ?
iris , open the door .
what 's going on ? open it , now .
no , get out .
bri needs a clear shot . i can give it to him .
i really don 't know how much
coming through , on you right . hey here we go .
oops , excuse me . hey tris , i really like your hair by the way .
hey peter , why don 't you take your food and sit down huh ?
besides i think we all should
we need to find out where the
i will not be a part of your violence . no one is asking you to .
one .
one more chance .
you 're hurting tris .
but killing jeanine will not gonna bring your mother back .
what is it ?
gentlemen , amity welcomes you .
you 're exceeding your jurisdiction .
what happened to that amity politeness .
alright , but under protest .
all amity report to the dome
you seem awfully stuck in that doorway .
what 's up there ?
my people are ready for war if that 's what it takes .
we depose those in power .
once you killed jeanine , who 's in power then ?
don 't tell me this isn 't about you , this is only about you .
what ?
what are you talking about ?
the answer is yes .
so are you asking me to petition to council
correct ?
it 's a pretty evasive answer . evasion is not dishonest .
where 's your scary boyfriend ?
i love heights .
i know it sounds crazy , but .
i know they say its all just wasteland out there but .
i need your help .
look who decided to show up .
alright folks , nothing to be nervous about .
hello .
why ? what she want with her ? tell me !
is that supposed to scare me ?
you know the punishment for that .
but can you ?
all i know , is that they put me in a sleeping si
you all know what this means
i wish i could do more .
it 's time we fight back .
and provided the instructions that
what : when
you can 't just abandon them
i have to admit that i 'm impressed
and turn yourself in .
i need you to open that box tris .
but the only people who have tried to it so far have died .
well
the chances of it being you of all people .
what 's remarkable is the amount of people you managed to murder .
but i 'm serving the greater good .
mam ?
are parents brought that on themselves .
the box , it was in their house .
all those lives could have been spared .
alright family reunion is over , it 's time to go .
four ! tris !
four !
please just let four go .
tell me .. do you appreciate irony ?
peter , is there another way to the ab ?
okay you do that !
you just choose our side whether you meant to or not .
let 's go !
i know it doesn 't make
get in .
initializing amity sim .
you 're an even bigger fool than your mother .
but i 'm not gonna fight you .

the gutter 's falling off , the paint 's shot .
you know , get off your ass and fix it . clean it up .
what 's the matter with people ?
here 's what i 'm gonna do .
okay ? but i am gonna write you up
that trellis lady had no idea who i was .
she should 've .
i didn 't want to wake derek .
i thought we hated your mother .
i mean she was funny and intense .
oh she takes a while to warm up
what do you think about uh what 's her name
what are you all doing here ?
and she 's sharing him with me .
good morning dr . bailey . you look nice today .
dr. bailey i 'm gonna need one of your residents .
it 's yours .
can you spare a resident ?
karev you never know
if there 's a patient in pain i 'm there .
there 's no need for you to be doing that . i can feel that .
they 're in the hospital so whatever you 're doing .
we gave him an epidural .
lexie
ivy ! where 's my daughter ?
he 's gonna kill my daughter .
let me go . i 've gotta get my daughter .
could we get some help here please .
okay .
poop ?
well we 'd feed a small tube up your nose

seth .

none of my interns are answering their pages .
clearly .
hey .
no all of it no give me that too
i need an intern to page me if my guy agrees to crap .
sadie said something about skills lab .
all that time in the skills lab is actually paying off .
no they 're just idiots .
i 'm gonna go get my crap chick some crap .
do you have a sec ?
charting . i 'm only charting .
things are possible.dreams feel true
and you realize that ...
okay .
her b p . is dangerously low .
there is no code team in outpatient surgery
hey how 's mr . soltanoff ?
it 's gotta be scary going to bed at night
it 's your fault you know .
now i can 't help it.you planted a seed .
no poo . no poo for you .
she 's telling you what 's real for her .
i still think this could be stomach cancer .
and i lay awake and feel lumps in my breasts
we live together.you should 've come to me .
no but maybe i could ve stopped you .
george this is the one thing that i have done
this was all me .
she 's like in love with you .
okay you know what ? sadie did that to herself .
let 's not pretend that you care about her .
he 's , you know ... he 's a little to the left , you know ,
clarence made some great choices musically .
i wasn 't some kid .
but tonight , it 's only what could have been .
when biggie died ,
after biggie 's taken to cedars-sinai hospital .
and particularly , mr. sean combs .
usually , clarence gets the call
because they worried about people at airports looking for him ,
so again , this was sort of masterminded
you know , i 'm sitting here because
i 'm cured . everything 's good , you know .
everything is good ,
so one action that i create could
considered a gangster , or a thug , or whatever you wanna call it ,
clarence is the type of person that wants everyone to do better
and he will argue it all day long , but i disagree completely .
thank you for doing what you do .
if he felt like you were going out there and doing for others
but if he feels like he did all this ,
of my time and my love .
in the end ,
let 's get that family together .
hey , man , i had a good life thus far .
you know , whenever i see clarence , he always gives me a hug ,
it just seemed funny at first
that 's not much of an apology .
and now i regret it . good-bye .
yeah , i just wanted to stop in and see my office
yeah .
oh , sorry . where were we ?
right , right .
i wouldn 't mind a cookie .
i really passed out hard .
the kids could 've screamed bloody murder
i 'm sorry .
yes .
is he an unspeakable abomination ?
well , he laughs at his own jokes ,
i 'm trying to invite my stupid brother to my wedding
hey , you 've reached george cooper .
see ?
sheldon , you tried .
hey , why didn 't you invite him in the first place ?
i get it ; i grew up with lots of brothers .
i can recognize sarcasm .
i 'm-i 'm-i 'm sorry .
your wish is my command .
oh , my god .
wow . you really can 't keep your hands off howard , can you ?
i just wanted to make sure you and amy didn 't get it .
you infected me a week before my wedding .
wear a veil ?
look at what you 've done to me !
there aren 't gonna be any wedding photos .
but if he says , " nerd says what , "
so , how was your date ?
we 're so sorry we ruined your date .
his date got ruined .
it looks like it 's getting better .
i 'm sorry ?
i have nothing to apologize for .
sometimes you can 't patch a tire .
actually , that 's always the case .
while i appreciate your folksy tire wisdom ,
hey . sheldon , are you and leonard putting up a christmas tree ?
saturnalia ?
in the pre-christian era ,
and that , charlie brown , is what boredom is all about .
you haven 't given me a gift .
don 't feel bad , penny , it 's a classic rookie mistake .
now , hey , it 's okay.you don 't have to get me anything in return .
it 's no wonder suicide rates skyrocket this time of year .
i 'm not giving you a present .
rlik ll5uo2x-j . 19
no . no , i brought this on myself
it 's happening to us .
yeah , i guess .
thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle .
i had no idea it was so heavy .
yeah . lucky for you it wasn 't moving .
my god , how fast were you going ?
good one . he couldn 't even get it started .
penny . so it 's your motorcycle ?
it 's fine .
you mind giving me a hand with speed racer here ?
so , um , dave , how do you know leonard ?
no , you 're not .
uh , well , it 's just that the physicists i know
um .. yeah . yeah , that sounds great .
boy , she 'll do , huh ?
so , you and her ... ?
really .
you see , the danger was that i might under or over-reciprocate ,
then i 'll look up the price of her gift online ,
it is , isn 't it ?
so my offer is come with me now
hanging from a pipe , having your toenails removed .
do you mind terribly if i borrow your car ?
are they still following us ?
somehow it just doesn 't seem like the right thing to do .
this road isn 't going anywhere . it 's taking us where we want to go .
good plan .
take another left through the window .
is the primary cause of world tension today .
you were right . the uncle , rudolph von trulsch , is the best shot .
he lives in italy . rome . works for a shipping company called vinciguerra
your job here is done when i tell you it 's done .
it should have been . i didn 't ask you to light up half of east berlin .
what was waiting for me was barely human . you should 've seen it run .
how so ?
rather a sad story , what with your dad being a big pal of stalin 's
ten ? eleven years old ?
you did , however , rise above it . special forces . k gb .
i do wonder if it was your father 's shame that gave you such drive , though . or ..
i understand that she was. extremely popular amongst your father 's friends
is this a joke ?
i 'm not going back behind that wall .
you don 't have to go anywhere that you don 't want to go .
what 's he doing here ?
wait .
of the soviet union by the black sea .
that man stole my father 's watch .
da , but a russian architect would fight .
so it 's no trouble unless you continue to question my actions .
would you like to finish what we started ?
you two are supposed to be looking after me .
either you start to look like you know what you 're doing .
good evening , mr. deveny .
i apologize it wasn 't brought up earlier .
is there anything else i can do for you ?
i 'm still on duty , mr. deveny .
but my shift ends in five minutes .
uncle rudi has invited us
would you like bigger glass ?
i wonder , did i leave it in the jag ?
why on earth would you do that ? he doesn 't have an invitation .
thank you . thank you .
i 'm victoria vinciguerra . i do believe an apology is in order .
if you don 't , there could be trouble .
are we in a rush ?
now , tell me , when did this happy accident occur ?
two years ago ? yes .
wanted to make sure it was serious .
why would she be ashamed ?
rudi . ah , waverly .
waverly runs the shipping department at british oil .
i stupidly seem to have lost my invitation .
yes . yes , i think we bumped into each other outside .
i do apologize . no , not at all .
what 's he done ?
they had it coming
how did you find alexander vinciguerra ?
the answer 's yes . that 's not happening
so , like i said , it 's not happening
try not to get lost .
why ?
and , uh , what exactly did you do to him ?
although he 's standing upright , he 's completely unconscious .
i 'm afraid that isn 't going to stop you getting hurt .
only my mother calls me napoleon .
you may have heard of the dark angel of ravensberg .
and today , you have the privilege .... of experiencing his work firsthand .
my apologies .
you wouldn 't describe him .
he was neither tall nor handsome , charismatic or amusing
he was bullied mercilessly ...
year merged with miserable year .
but what the other boys didn 't understand about their victim was .
he saw them as instruments of learning .
you doing okay , cowboy ?
you did . just not the ones in your shoes .
you everything i know . you won 't be able to stop me .
don 't kick yourself .
that got their attention . they 'll have chopper waiting for us at airport .
mr. solo . we meet again .
follow me
then we must give them an appropriate welcome .
naval intelligence for the remainder of the mission .
they are the key to the u.s. of a. winning the arms race .
gentlemen , can you hear me ?
well done , solo , yep , yeah . you got there in the end .
a daughter 's touch .
you 're wrong .
we assumed his nazi colleagues would come knocking at his daughter 's door
you 're wrong . i saw her betray us at vinciguerra .
the meeting is confirmed .
the only way she could stay in the game .
if you can catch him .
we don 't even know which boat we 're looking for .
he died five years ago ...
submarine surfaces at 0800 . gives us 20 minutes , gentlemen .
i have an idea which might make things quicker .
diadema , this is napoleon solo .
earlier today ... i killed your husband .
ramp it up , please , solo .
but you don 't think it 's very weird , do you , harlo ?
you took a piece of white felt ..
and now it 's dry ..
and since i like my face just the way it is .
i may see dead people , but then , by god , i do something about it
i 'm sorry , sir , but i don 't have a " go easy " gear .
hot at all , orficer varner .
i believe in a higher power and the afterlife .
others do .
don 't worry , penny .
i 'm sorry your life was so short .
here we are again .
most of it was not my fault .
yes , i know but he had to be stopped right now ..
that 's what penny wanted to tell me . that 's why she hadn 't left yet .
they know when death is coming and want to watch .
they want extreme , operatic violence and terror .
do you see death in me ?
and a long , happy life for you , okay ?
wearing ? i don 't know .
i 'm walking back to it right now .
well , i 'm not like most people .
it 's gone now .
so , is fungus bob a man or something new in the neighborhood ?
did you check the refrigerator for any severed heads ?
where else would you expect to find severed heads ?
stormy , stormy , someone 's here . i got to go .
august 14th .
that 's tomorrow . what happens tomorrow ?
get out of there , oddie .
i guarantee you hell on earth is coming to pico mundo .
that 's just because i 've got such great respect for your balance , sir .
there 's a little bit of bullshit in it . a little .
odd this is one of our newer officers .
all right , well , you do agree that he 's strange and suspicious , right ?
you 'd already be there .
only because you 're never wrong ,
she 's the one
i love to hear me say it .
since when are we living together ?
oh , i guess i didn 't think " let 's put a pin in it " meant " yes . "
what !
it 's him ? you 're sure ? sure , i 'm sure !
not this guy .
my blood-hey , odd
i finished that trinket you asked for .
no , i said .
i get in the moment .
tit 's not for stormy .
a bullet going through a heart .
so madly i would cut off my hand if that made any sense as proof of love .
no one was trying to kill me , stormy .
you know , this is the craziest conversation i 've ever had
time feels like a powerful black wave ..
i must run faster .
something 's wrong .
there 's going to be a massacre .
ho , all we know is it 's the same uniforms ,
god , i 'm missing something . i 'm missing a piece of the puzzle .
evening !
yeah .
the chief sent me .
i 've seen him a couple times today but no , i don 't know him .
oh , please .
you and puppies , totally adorable .
it 's about my dream , isn 't it ?
my skull was all whacked , my eyeball swollen .
no place . a dream place . fuzzy .
bowling ? did you hit your head ?
levanna 's birthday is sunday , but tips are real good on a sunday .
yeah , they did .
i need em to help me see the danger coming so i can maybe prevent it .
oddie , will you ever leave here ?
i meant while you 're alive .
hey , hey . look , look .
it 's not that . it 's-
that must be for you .
i heard the scream . she ran across my yard .
i shot the dogs
so somewhere between 8 : 00 and midnight ,
he was teaching a class from 6 : 00 to 10 : 00 .
he got home about two minutes too late .
they belong to bob robertson .
i want an a. p. b. put out on this guy now !
i 'll have a search warrant in the morning
nobody showed . it was a complete waste of my time .
exactly where were you between the hours of 8 : 00 and 10 : 00 ?
and stormy never actually saw you .
and the whole time in the church ,
he 's been haunting me ever since , blaming me for his death .
damn it .
it 's just me , again , rosalia .
if i 'm being framed ,
before someone finds you and has a new love of tesus scared into em ?
after the federal government abandoned this prison ..
rumor has it that at von zipper 's burgers the fries were delicious ...
and yet , this fine dining establishment ..
welcome to the gas chamber .
but i tell her vegas is packed with dead people and bad guys
the chief
oh , my god .
who could come in here right now and not get my back up .
had to .
any road i choose could lead me right back to the same fate .
am i in god 's hands ?
have i ever told you you 've got a lot of issues ?
do you love me ?
see ? it 's working
i 'm hoping bob left a clue on his computer .
hey .
i 'm walking towards the fridge .
don 't " uh-huh " me . i told you ..
get out of there , oddie .
yeah ? well , you tell whoever 's buying it that our ice cream ..
some .
required .
let 's just say this tattoo is a crude obscenity .
i once had a run-in with some devil worshipers .
1p-o-d . prince of darkness
this guy bob robertson got aggressive with you ?
and that police van protecting stormy ?
to bust me for fungus bob 's murder .
you are eating and reading at the same time .
no ? not so good ? okay , fine .
robertson , that idiot
when i find robertson , i 'm gonna kill him .
looks like their plan was to jump out at the end of the mall disaster
four .
this just so happens to be my very favorite book .
viola .
odd ! geez !
we had to pick out a birthday present for levanna .
look , your dream , it 's happening right here , right now .
ladies , i need you to take viola and get her out of here , okay ?
this made dorothy so very angry ..
and dashed it all over the wicked witch
that would be neither , boss .
stick a co , maybe .
got a shank in here .
you 're not a good liar .
move along.deputy
in the old man 's back pocket , are you ?
he may run this place during the day ,
how are we doing it ?
infirmary .
if i get that pugnac ,
which is ?
a little prep for your arrival .
the idea ?
they don 't exactly stock it at the commissary .
someone 's working on it as we speak .
our relationship transcends race .
i can 't let you do it .
can 't be done , michael .
every step 's already been mapped out .
you may have the blueprints of this place ,
as far as these guys are concerned ,
okay , if you 're a reporter ..
oh . you family ?
we were in a relationship a few years back .
because the victim was the vice president 's brother .
that 's not what i meant .
lincoln worked for steadman 's company .
two weeks later , steadman 's shot dead .
what 's up there in that infirmary that you need so bad ?
thought we had an understanding .
you made it pretty clear you ain 't blood .
nice looking piece of steel , bit of work .
well , maybe you 're one of them milk chickens ,
maybe we oughta take a look at them insides and find out .
i want in .
did you just say you 're in ?
you know the old saying , don 't you ?
whatever it takes .
you have to prove yourself before we trust you with the heavy artillery .
gates closing
closer it gets to an execution ,
it was a closed trial , so no one outside of the courtroom saw it .
maybe they got it right .
open up . badge !
it 's my girl 's birthday .
you gotta let me call her ! please !
i seen your kicks , sucre .

what are you talking about ?
what do you mean , like , go home ? i mean , you just got here .
you got to move on with your life .
i really don 't have time .
it 's come to our attention that you made a foil request
records show that you made a dupe of the surveillance tape .
mind us asking why ?
she was under the impression that the guy was innocent .
don 't pull that card on me .
she says she used to date crab simmons .
you want to hear what i have to say ,
you want to hear what i have to say or not ?
over here
we 'll stay out here in the open where they can 't get to us .
only reason why i 'm talking to you
crab didn 't use . he had a bad heart .
i mean , don 't you think it 's just the slightest bit of a coincidence
things they didn 't want to get out .
like who was really behind that hit that night .
they were just pawns in a big game
you 're trapped in that little hole of yours .
who 's my 1 : 00 ?
better late than never , right ?
we 'll see about that .
what it is you 're doing up there .
oh , you 're the best husband ever !
i guess .
boy , when was the last time stuart cleaned this place ?
oh , okay , i 'm about to suck something up .
howie , i don 't want to play lego , toenail or pill anymore .

just one thing .
two words , anger management .
diego 's right . we found the way home .
sure we do . it 's right there .
you want to pirate a pirate ship from pirates .
wait a minute , maybe we can help each other .

what the hell are you talkin ' about , man ?
hey ! put your gun down !
we 're not cops , all right ? we work for antoine vallon .
shut up ! shut up ! what 'd you say ?
now , to that effect ,
we need to give americans a product they can love .
sir , i have dissected this bill . there are no loopholes .
forget machines .
americans don 't want a machine
you 're not you because of your legs , your arms , your hands .
it 's your brain 's capacity to process information that makes you who you are .
i 've never played with these .
all you have to do is let it out .
who do you think 's gonna be investigating you ?
i 'm gonna have ' em in bracelets within a month , man .
cameras ofr
i 'm sorry .
asshole
pass
your armor , state-of-the-art , but not invulnerable .
multiple hits , and guess who ends up in the recycling bin ?
that count . it 's who 's handling them .
you think you can do this ?
just stick to my job ? combat robots are my job , doc .
26 billion .
i 've looked forward to meeting you , detective .
well , we funded this program to give men like you a second chance .
you hit me , you get a ticket back home
but make no mistake , tin man , my gun will .
the em-208s will try to maneuver you so mattox can get a clear shot .
if mattox hits you , everything but your life support will shut down .
i don 't know about that . i 've been through a lot .
i say we go on three .
how 's it going down there ?
wow .
his software is faster . his hardware is stronger .
least i know you 're the right color now .
we 're expecting people from every corner of the city
is he a changed man ?
alex , we 're gonna upload the entire dpd database into your brain .
all right .
drop the levels until i tell you to stop .
pull the footage . put it on a loop .
everything
i 'd like to see him .
look , i won 't lie to you .
i looked in his eyes and i couldn 't see my husband .
he 's responding to drugs differently now .
just give me a little more time .
this goes for every squad in every department .
no arguments , no complaints .
i said no complaints ! and i mean it . now
john biggs is target number one .
should be ready to move in on my request .
murphy .
i 'm fine , sergeant .
well , look , i mean , the tide is definitely turning
but , i think our next guest will have a different point of view .
senator , thank you for joining us .
senator , do you know what this is ?
our polls at novakelement.com are tight at 50-50 .
it 's about whether america 's willing to give robots
this sea change we 're witnessing , and it is a sea change ,
has the us senate become pro-crime ?
no , no , 5000 .
what , you too busy to walk us in ?
where are my trip wires ? i gotta do this myself ?
i can 't move any product with this thing on the streets .
relax . the guy 's a walkin ' zombie .
he 's not going after you . we covered our tracks .
as far as i can tell , he 's still doing his job .
he 's undoing what we did to him .
how is that even possible ?
alex
well , this should be interesting .
we 're not cops , all right ? we work for antoine vallon .
what 'd you say ?
where 's antoine vallon ?
i know you remember me , jerry .
and i got your prints all over ' em .
i also have cctv footage of you and vallon the same day he tried to kill me .
it won 't work . now that his partner got hit , he 's never gonna let it go .
lewis ' hospital
you know what they do to cops in prison , man ?
how long you think before he gives you up ?
swear to christ . it was dean .
thank you for your cooperation .
now i know why we couldn 't get an arrest .
we got anything on her ?
what do you think ?
this might actually tip this thing right into the net .
even the police ,
machines , however , are corruption free .
thank you , alex , for all you 've done .
detective murphy is currently in critical condition .
at this time , omnicorp 's sole concern is the full recovery of detective murphy .
i sincerely hope the senate makes the right vote tomorrow
he has been my mentor and my strength
so i vote yes .
that 's us ahead , 3 to 10 .
alex
alex , put down the gun .
the attempted murder of a police officer .
there was an accident
take a hint , kid ?
jay ! a thousand ways to die .
this is the last time i 'm gonna clean up your shit .
she 's a beauty .
they tumble out .. ... wit following wisdom .
grab that end
i am " recording the decline "
in the hope of preventing their extinction
big storm coming .
no , he 's not . he 's an outlaw , just like us .
spin it .
get that dirt , all of it , clean , clean it .
away from camp .
one 's a falling angel , the other one 's a rising devil .
do you think that 's a smart play ?
quicker than tracking him , simpler .
yeah , i guess if you knew where rose and daddy was ,
he was dying to be famous .
he come to me one time , and he said
so i 'm thinking
wasn 't long before he sees the poster ,
and what he says chills me to the bone .
" be a thousand by the ' morrow . "
and a body hit dirt . spin around
so i walk and i shoot ,
coffee .
for god 's sake . language , rose .
only thing dry 's my mouth .
you remember nothing from last night ?
bless you .
good day , sir .
scotland is far , far away .
he knows i 'm your daughter ,
the lord sensed my wavering faith .
" thou shall not be afraid of any terror of night , "
you let me ? ha !
would you two shut up and help me down ?
do you know how many liters of blood
good girl . you got that right .
but i 'm too young !
we 'll help you through it .
ha ! responsible ?
i meant the dog .

shut up .
oh . okay .
shep 's busy , so you 're just going to have to deal with me .
back on your right .
well , it looks like you 're swapping out
is that for that little girl out there ?
don 't you think there 's a little more
you know , like , the truth , doctor ?
you want to go and tell that sweet little girl
you want to explain death to her ?
i don 't think you should make a habit of it ,
okay . i want you to take this
yes , because i want you to get used to this situation .
yeah , okay .
all right . happy birthday .
there is a minor tradition .
i don 't know why we 've never been here before .
things just wrapped up quicker than i thought .
how the hell are you ?
mary , you remember shep 's son travis , don 't you ?
ryan , did daddy tell you
dr. mccarthy : travis , why don 't you pull up a chair and join us ?
thank you , doc . i 'd like to , but i got an early morning
you got a ring , son ?

i am not marrying this man .
i 've been putting it off and putting it off
but since yours is the only opinion
what am i gonna do ...
i mean , should i get one of those new hybrids

what is going on in that head of yours ?
we are runnin ' out of time .
all right , here we go . please . we need ..
green .

dad , there 's no such thing as a category 7 .
i hope you 're not trying to prove something
i just wanna stay near the hospital .
let 's saddle up .
all right .
we 're gonna see damage
looks like the old place could do with a lick of paint .
something that ...
i let her down , dad .
get that out of your head .
the very good , the very gentle , the very brave .
is that from the good book , pastor shaw ?
there 's no shame in being a broken man .
you just pick up the pieces
you can 't swim .
so , look , whatever we 're f-feeling ,
let 's go . let 's go to work .
he had a really hard day .
i didn 't kidnap him .
he wasn 't ready .
okay , okay .

but i guess you have been busy , haven 't you ?
sure .
if you want to tap out , it 's cool .
your boyfriend did just collapse .
me stopping to freak out
fair enough .
i 'm talking about years , decades .
but pressure or not , don 't wait too long .
what part of " updates at every stage " was unclear ?
sometimes you just forget everything else , right ?

how about a little sparkle ?
hip dislocation , fractures of his femur ,
kepner , i need you to speak differently .

circle back to rumlow and protect the hostages .
iet 's see
backing up the hard drive .
okay .
you 're damn right .
i didn 't lie
i 'm not obliged to do anything
soldiers trust each other . that 's what makes it an army .
last time i trusted someone , i lost an eye .
agent romanoff is comfortable with everything .
he had a few suggestions
the satellites can read a terrorist 's dna before he steps outside his spider hole
we can 't afford to wait that long .
tor once , we 're way ahead of the curve .
you know , i read those ssr files .
like how the hell did a french pirate
i can draw a map if it 'd help .
but this council takes things like international piracy fairly seriously .
i don 't care about one boat , i care about the fleet .
i work 40 floors away and it takes a hijacking for you to visit ?

i 'm sorry to have to do this , but i had no place else to crash .
the honour 's mine , captain .
that photo was taken five years after nick and i met ,
so , i 'm gonna ask again .
he told me not to trust anyone .
i 'm sorry .
records

it kind of feels personal .
give it up , rogers ! get that door open !
are you kidding me ?
stand down , captain rogers . stand down .
eyes here .
somebody 's trying to hide something
can you override it ?
slightly .
this is a program that s.h.i.e.l.d. developed
no . my fiance was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations .
congratulations . where are you guys thinking about going ?
i have the exact same glasses .

youl said nine minutes . come on . relax
standard tac team .

whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off
this building is in the wrong place .
may be where it started
if you 're already working in a secret office ,
y-e-s spells yes .
he 's been dead for years .
second , look around you .
in 1972 , i received a terminal diagnosis .
my mind , however , that was worth saving
s.h.i.e.l.d. recruited german scientists with strategic value .
i also helped my own .
prove it
the war taught us much .
after the war , s.h.i.e.i.d. was founded ,
listen , i got to fly home tonight
no , not really .
wants to be a reporter , i think . i don 't know .
doesn 't sound like much of a problem to me .
but this isn 't the place to talk about it .
thank you .
bring the car around .
agent sitwell , how was lunch ?
who is this ?
your other 10 o 'clock
you 're gonna go around the corner to your right .
you and i are gonna take a ride .

never heard of it .
didn 't work so great for him , but we found a use for it .
any attempt on the director 's life had to look successful .
besides ,
bucky , no !
the man on the bridge .
you met him earlier this week on another assignment .
your work has been a gift to mankind .
and i need you to do it one more time .
and tomorrow morning , we 're gonna give it a push .
and hydra can 't give the world the freedom it deserves .
then wipe him and start over .
see , it 's stuff like this that gives me trust issues .
i don 't think the council 's accepting my calls any more
one or two won 't cut ic .
we have to assume everyone aboard those carriers is hydra .
and maybe , just maybe we can salvage what 's left .
you gave me this mission . this is how it ends .
hydra grew right under your nose and nobody noticed .
how many paid the price before you did ?
even if you had , would you have told me ?
i know , i 'm sorry . i just kind of wanted to be alone .
it was okay .
we can put the couch cushions on the floor
come on .
the thing is , you don 't have to .
he 's gonna be there , you know .
t don ' know if i can do that .
he doesn 't know you .
you gonna wear that ?
man .
we are go on guidance .
and how was your flight ?
the ride from the airport , less so .
negative dt six . the pattern is full .
'll check it out
finally , we 're here .
attention all s.h.i.e.l.d. agents ,
some of you were even ordered to hunt me down .
s.h.i.e.l.d. is not what we thought it was .
alexander pierce is their leader .
they could be standing right next to you .
absolute control
unless we stop them .
but the price of freedom is high . it always has been .
and if i 'm the only one , then so be it .
did you write that down first , or was it off the top of your head ?
arrest him .
i know you erased my password .
but if you want to stay ahead of me , mr secretary ,
encryption code accepted .
charlie carrier is 45 degrees off the port bow .

ok , black elastic has been scratched from race six .
i 'll make you a cuppa .
listen .
but the odds are so long .
use your knees . use your hands .
it 's all about strength .
it 's not about strength . it 's about positioning .
you push up the neck with the heel of your hands .
good !
yeah , he is .

that depends on whether you give me one .

the spiral of scales open in

and then it feels like
it ends with dinosaurs .
i don 't .
that will accomplish what ?
yes , bree believed in old-fashioned values .
each new morning in suburbia brings with it
little white lies , told not to hunt ...
.. but to make life more pleasant .
oh , for god 's sake , this is unbelievable .
of course , every now and then ,
we know you want to trust mike ,
all we know is
well , i wouldn 't put it past them .

the walls between our bedrooms are paper thin .
mike !
uh .... . yeah . yeah . i 'm a little bit embarrassed .

i told the police
you don 't think i killed mrs. huber ?
i could never think you killed anybody ,
jail 's kinda gross .
more travel ?

look , wait . wait . i know what this means to you .
if i don 't make vice president now ,
so was mine . but i 'm here , aren 't i ?
she said you broke up with her
i said that . but it was just an excuse .
really :
but the truth is , there 's someone else .
unless you 're really firm with her ,
better still , be brutal .
i 'll be dead inside a year .
so , who 's the woman they think you killed ?
the cops are all over me .
if i am close . i don 't see it .
one of those trails will lead to deidre .

i have a finger here .
no , a viable finger .
i-is that bad or good ?
that 's good .
i think we should take this thing off
why is time a factor ?
tick tock , dr. grey .
maybe you should refrain from calling him a jackass .
maybe i should ask him .
yeah .
after .
most people would 've considered dropping a bomb
well , uh , you proposed , and we were married like 12 hours later .
yeah ,
that 'll buy us a few minutes .
i can give you guys 15 minutes ,

dr. torres , it has to be .
that is why we 're gonna use the second toe .

sheldon cooper does not get lucky !
it doesn 't matter .
for the most part , i really try to disrupt
that 's what you wanna look for .
as you can see ,
we just try not to take too much of one thing .
this disturbing creature is my cameraman , alec .
dude , i don 't think you understand how dangerous this is .
we 're breaking so many laws just by being here .
but isn 't that part of the fun , almost getting caught ?
wanna play the word game ?
something to fucking do .
i have to get out , i have to get out !
i got you , i got you !

i thought i grabbed the right one , i just , i ...
we got company .

the two of you ...
no one 's used to talking across channels .
we would have to isolate and evacuate the president , the vp ,
hospitals , nursing homes .
food supplies dwindle fast .
now we 're talking martial law .
just to be sure of what we 're really dealing with .
but if one more person tests positive , we will enact a full-scale response .
there comes a day when the teacher realizes he 's got nothing left to give .
proud ?
i 'm going back to africa .
it has to have originated in africa .
or walls in general .
so , you 're back in the game .

i do not know who you are but i had a great time today .
i do not say no things to explain .
she is dangerous .
it may be my only relative .
will not create problem so , are you ?
but i can not answer the dog .
uncle jor-el was like my father .
and so my father also built a ship .
and he and my mother would come soon after .
as the asteroid moved me the galaxy
know not .
kal-el has enemies who would try everything to destroy it .
maybe not intentionally .
i was wrong .
my treasure , you are a best warrior of apokolips .
the almighty darkseid ?
furies !
call the dogs to clean up the mess .
never do that .
the views show the precursor kara danger .
i hope it is rational .
and we wait ?
can i call you at any time .
doomsday judgement .
wait ! the tube .
nobody to blame .
let 's go to apokolips . we need your help to get there .
we just want to borrow box your mother

the entire planet is a deadly trap .
if barda refuses to help , how are we : : :
i 'll go with you .
you need me , therefore swallow .
there is no better place than home .
did you know darkseid are we here ?
well , i think that was a warm up .
we all know what is our task
i think we will by land .
may not be the right time , but you were always an inspiration .
well , well . the gang 's all here .
although personally , i 'm anxious to see it die .
but considering the situation , would be redundancy .
to try .
damn . take the head of the attacker to darkseid .
hail darkseid !
it must be . i coached the .
i do not want to go .
i will not fight you .
what 's wrong with the beast ?
take off your armor .
let me kill you , grandma .
i like to win the cake and eat it .
as i said , grandma ?
it 's what is scheduled to do .
darkseid 's evil .
or just brought up the evil that exists in me ?
and it 's good . nothing else matters .
when you are strong , i take it somewhere .
where can you be yourself .
it seems correct .
i 'll miss you more than you can imagine .
perhaps because , as precursor , have seen something worthwhile in me .
try not to disappoint her .
you will always have a home here .
one day you asked me if i remembered the name of my mother .
kal , i 'm ready .
still owes me a computer .
always have to say the last word .
declan ... declan reilly is his name .
he comes at night ! he comes with others !
i do not believe you , sir this court does not believe you .
quiet in court ! quiet , please .
left at fourteen to earn a living .
a bit much , yes .
and despite the greatest efforts of a whole army of academics ,
the language is developing faster than our progress .
is that too much , max ?
i submit that the extraordinary , the unconventional ,
but we need something more than impassioned advocacy .
qualifications , yes . well , um ...
beyond those , uh , i have an intimate knowledge of the romance tongues ,
i have sufficient knowledge of hebrew and syriac
forgive me .... for rattling on . i 'm sure you have questions .
i 'll make a fist of it , uh , on the hoof , as it were .
or perhaps the middle dutch , klever ,
forgive me for keeping it from you .
that 's all mine . ada , the entire language .
but it 's so sudden .
is this truly what you wish ? for all of us ?
surgeon , a captain in the united states army .
classified a danger to others .
the prisoner is in a rage , spitting dozens of times ,
march 17th , three days now the prisoner
repeatedly claiming to look for
like orthrus , a two-headed dog of a line .
your book , mr. murray , will need to establish
we 've been here before , max .
i 'm sorry . ada .
for this disruption .
no doubts , james , no jitters .
now that it 's started , let 's see it through , steadfast and resolved .
we live today knowing the origins of the earth ,
our ships ' masters know the precise measurements of latitude and longitude .
the time has come to accord this great language of ours
let us be connected , all of us in this great endeavour ,
well , mr. bradley and i put a big hole in the ground .
now all we have to do is try to keep up with him .
let 's have a good look at these slips .
i am your grateful recipient .
i have been much acquainted with that darkness .
for letting me lend my light to yours .
yours , w.c. minor . crowthorne , berkshire .
we 'll put your name on it now too .
perhaps you should be writing the definitions and .... well ,
an american .. and a scot ?
a story for another day . let 's continue the comparison .
both gray .
aye , but which is which ?
it is by his grace alone .
you will , my friend .
yea , though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death ...
mrs. merrett , wait . what did i do ?
forgive me . i should not have presumed .
please , doctor , let me be .
i am who i am .
it 's freedom , mrs. merritt .
i 've gone to the ends of the world on the wings of words .
when i read ...
i suspect he is just the ticket
i 'm adrift , ada .
i need to tell you some things .
all the wisdom , all the diligence , and you simply seek to ...
how much time have you spent with this man ?
his work on the dictionary proves he is sane .
what about repentance ? ada , what about redemption ?
we all deserve more than to have it all sullied by some ...
i couldn 't call into question the morality of every invisible volunteer
this one , didn 't you hear , he cheats on the times crossword .
how many new words for things that yet to be imagined ?
no language can ever be permanently the same , james .
but how can the work be ended if not ever completed ?
generations after you will continue this work
let it go . attend to yourself . leave the project to me .
with bradley in charge and the university press firmly driving the endeavour .
thank you , mr. gell .
sorry , my husband 's unable to attend .
i am certain they can give a few moments of their time in return .
please , go ahead .
diligence . i looked it up in your dictionary .

but these kind of things take time .
i so did not understand the ending of lost
i 'm sorry i was so hard on you .
i believe in each one of you !
and every time i talked about walking away ,
and i 'll wait for you at lunch break and after school ,
there 's nothing you can do .
this isn 't junior school anymore .
we 're the most insignificant , powerless people in the school .
i learnt a new trick .

what 's the matter ? what are you frightened of ?
that fast as you can go ?
oi ! come here ! here , boy !
oi . what you running for ?

let the land be my eyes and ears .
find the one who drew it .
the sword must be mine . the king must die .
find the new king .
a youtube thing . a social experiment .
look .
put it into google translate .
pay attention , everybody .
why don 't you introduce yourself ?
we don 't know you , and we don 't want to know you .
good people ,
who will kneel at his feet and swear allegiance ?
but rokas saw it with his own eyes .
fallen warriors from battles of old .
for now , they can only enter this realm after dark .
when they rise , time freezes
or when every risen warrior ...
that 's why my mum disappeared .
there are three moons until the solar eclipse
who 's morgana ?
she is greed , entitlement ,
that 's why her strength returns .
and i 'm supposed to stop her ?
i 'm not even old enough to do a paper round .
it 's too dangerous , we 'll die .
it 's been great to meet you , and good luck with everything .
there is no turning back .
defeat morgana in her own realm
christmas day , that was exhausting .
oh , my god . oh , my god . oh , my god . oh , my god .
we need to go somewhere no one can find us .
this is destiny .
so they think themselves knights ?

i didn 't deserve that .

i shouldn 't have said what i did .
are those the cheese puffs i brought ?
well , more for me .
and then we hit a rough patch , and we stumbled ,
and then when someone has to tell me
and it almost sounded sincere .
enough of a feeling to go dig up a construction site ?
are you sure you looked under your bed ?
okay . honey , mommy can 't help you right now .
so just you , or did you adopt a bunch of orphans
what was that about today ?
you know , we may have to do a little downsizing .
i don 't know !
well , you want us to move ?
gaby . i am miserable at work . i can 't do it anymore .
when you were drowning your guilt in booze ,
now it is your turn .

a sort of " in case i need it " soul .
i disagree with you .
i need it back . just give it to me back .
and .
no . it 's not for sale .
i decided to buy it and now it 's mine .
it 's in a safe place , baby .
my favorite place .
it 's stupid . nothing happened . nothing really .
they never tell you the rest of the story for a very good reason .
life begins , and that 's way harder to handle than any dragon .
you know why i don 't believe in the soul ?
and if there was something ,
come in .
wo . gotta do my taxes
i mean , she cooks and
oh , my god , she gives an amazing .

so , do you believe the afghani people are happy about our presence here ?
afghanis is the currency

fahim .
i 'm a big fan of the movie predator with arnold schwarzenegger .
you think you 're in the fucking army ?
uh , that 's my supplies . camera stuff .
this is an orange ruck . no , ma 'am . not on my vehicle .
well , where are you gonna hide it ? inside a fucking sunset ?
fix it .
coughlin . i didn 't recognize you .
it makes me taller .
i 'm dying to know who blew up my well .
i 'm dying to know who blew up my wel
what 'd he say ?
okay ! heads on a swivel !
we most surely did .
stay in the vehicle !
kim , don 't get out of the car ! kim !
it reminds me of my time living in london .
but i do not know you .
imm ?
you have something they want for the mornings ?
hmm .
oh , right , it 's my fault . great , chris . you 're a genius .
ugh ! did you have that prepared ?
pussy !
you should go to the rock ' n ' roll museum .
ney you shitting me ?
what is it ?
i thought you understood everything .
i specialise .
what 's so important about five boring murders ?
yes , sir . did you not know that , sir ?
not unlike yourself ... sir .
oh , i wasn 't being critical .
five ? we thought three ,
as ever , you see but you do not observe .
a bet ? !
that 's a risk you 'll have to take .
why not ? it 's so much more exciting than gambling with others ' .
rest assured , it has features of interest .
you really do .
a dead woman walking the earth .
i do ?
perhaps since i convinced the reading public that
you may , however , rest assured there are no ghosts in this world .
sorry , what did you say ?
i thought you were a doctor !
including the contents of the envelope you received ?
i assume she was capable of finding a reason .
ricoletti ?
i 've never heard of her .
we 'll show ourselves out . i hope to see you again in the morning .
then sadly i shall be solving your murder . good day .
will you see that lady carmichael receives this . thank you .
certainly , sir .
lady carmichael will sleep alone tonight ,
you think the spectre , er , bride ,
guilt is eating away at his soul .
something in his past . the orange pips were a reminder .
not at all .
sir eustace knows this only too well ,
i presume .
they are the shadows that define our every sunny day .
there 's something more than murder he fears .
no . you think so . i could tell .
yes , you have .
oh , why not ?
holmes , against absolutely no opposition whatsoever ,
i am currently attempting to have a perfectly
why do you need to be alone ?
sorry ?
i said the murderer did leave a note .
i dunno , i just sort of do .
which is strange , because he likes that bit .
i 'm sure he was exaggerating .
obviously , i 've returned the courtesy .
they smell so ...
i 'm sure you acquainted yourself with them before now .
tell me , does the illustrator travel with you ?
i 'm aware of all six occasions you have visited these apartments
because doesn 't this remind you of another case ?
there 's nothing new under the sun . what was it ?
do you remember ?
i 'm sorry ?
well , i 'll tell you what , that rather blows the cobwebs away .
how do i look ?
you blew your own brains out , how could you survive ?
i have to go back !
i was ... i was nearly there , i nearly had it !
go back where ? you didn 't get very far .
lodged in my hard drive ,
shot herself in the head , exactly like moriarty .
we 've only just found out ,
what progress have you made ? what have you been doing ?
i 've been in my mind palace , of course .
runninq an experiment . how would i have solved the crime ,
i had all the details perfect .
no , he can do this , i 've seen it .
yes , and i need to get back there .
maybe there are one or two things that i know that you don 't .
did you make a list ?
that waistcoat is clearly newer than the jacket .
of what ?
no , it 's not that , he goes into a sort of trance .
we have an agreement , my brother and i , ever since that day .
i alleviate boredom and
you could die !
oh , i suppose we should .
yep , that 's where i 'm looking .
i think it would be a good idea .
could you all just shut up for five minutes !
i was nearly there before
sherlock , listen to me .
holmes , how could you ?
it seemed obvious to me
help from her friends .
i was talking to mary .
he likes to keep an eye on his mad sibling .
of course it hasn 't ,
only now , i 'm afraid .
time i sped up . enough chatter , let 's concentrate .
what do they want to accomplish ?
this time , should anyone attempt to identify her ,
die to prove a point ?
every war has suicide missions and make no mistake , this is war .
the invisible army hovering at our elbow ,
but an army nonetheless ,
so you see , watson , mycroft was right .
she was dying .
emelia ricoletti .
so she decided to make her death count .
hooper !
for the record , holmes , she didn 't have me fooled .
that would take weeks to find , if those records even exists .
got it .
i need to know i was right , then i 'll be sure .
yes .
my investigation was the fantasy ,
i need to try !
the corpse they substituted for her after the so-called suicide ?
but where ?
but that .. that 's exactly what they must have done .
they found a body ,
it 's why we came here . i need to know .
this is important to me !
john ...
we have a case , we have a real-life problem right now .
just let me do this .
that 's how you got in this state !
i 'm not playing this time , sherlock . not any more !
i 'm taking mary home .
more than likely .
we do have slightly more pressing matters to hand , little brother .
fans , we 're gonna go now to the ridin ' dirty bucking chute ..
go , uke !
for over a year , an injury has sidelined him .
he has a long way to go .
we 'll see .
yeah , go !
hey , larry .
luke , hey , man . how are you doing ?
i know it feels good to get a win under your belt , doesn 't it ?
let me ask you . you need to come visit us .
important folk . come get a beer .
yes . okay .
you had a good night .
i got a hat just like that .
no , you hold on to it . looks better on you .
may i ?
nice to meet you , sophia .
you were the big winner tonight , right ?
oh , no . doesn 't work like that where i 'm from .
you 're buying
i 've been looking all over for you .
you really should eat something
how do you know about ruth ?
what do you care ?
i am a total failure .
father thinks that art stopped with matisse and picasso .
you try and raise your children right , ira ...
very good . very good .
it was nice seeing you talk like that .
hey , ruth . i need to ask you something .
i 've always wanted one since i was a little girl .
i feel this need , this responsibility ,
you can ask me now
if you marry me , you may never have a family .
the war was over .
we 're closed !
you cannot tell me what i 'm willing to give up !
i was here , clinging to the hope ..
yes , and have kids . but that 's a dream , ira .
unless you don 't love me anymore .
a chance at life together
he sure has been through a lot .
ilulke .
what are you doing right now ?
everyone was always screaming in weird languages .
my pants were too short always .
growing up on a cattle ranch , everybody i knew was the same .
i 'm jealous .
i wanted to be like everyone else when i was little
i think before i met you , the closest thing i came to cattle was
you said you love the house , right ?
doesn 't look like anyone 's home .
yeah , and which one are you ?
what are you doing ?
i 'd love to . this is the most important thing to me .
this is adrienne trancis
nice to meet you , luke .
no , never made it to college .
no , i can 't say that i am .
honestly ?
think there 's more bullshit here than where i work
why can 't you try to fit into mine ?
it was a joke , okay ? she thought it was funny .
what if she was just trying to be polite ?
whac ?
do you really see yourself living on a ranch ?
and what am i gonna do ?
go out with your artist friends ? go to brunch ?
there 's nothing we can do .
i did , and that 's what he said
there must be something more we can do .
you be good . okay , pal ?
maybe i 'll raise chickens ..
if that 's what you want .
anything at all . a farmer , a lawyer , an astronomer .
and who knows what they would 've done to daniel .
ruth , you are my family .
we never saw daniel again .
oh , shit .
the bull fighter 's taking the bull away in the other direction .

i 'll let you know .
so , are you light-headed , dizzy ?
i 'd like you to stay overnight for observation .
i came as soon as i heard
should be here .
yeah , me , too .
oh , really ?
look , sophia .
but you 're going to have to figure out for yourself what that 's going to be .
i think you should go .
even if that happiness no longer includes me .
always .
we focused on celebrating all the wonderful things we had
ruthie
the paintings ruth and i had collected

damiel mcdonald

physics and astronomy at the university college london .
i moved back to the states a few years ago .
i knew i had to bring you this .
you did everything you could with luke , sophia .

uh , yes . this is she .
i 've been trying to reach you .
i 'm sorry , ms. danko .

specifically for the occasion .
my beloved ruth .

we celebrated , we achieved
we 'll start the bidding at $ 1,000 for portrait of ruth .

and all of it 's blue , so you 're covered .

and now you 're embarrassed
'cause you look pretty dour for someone
he joined the army . yes , im in .
why are you trying to stop him ?
and ?
but why would you want to stop him ?
don 't you think that 's a problem ?
awesome ?
what , he 's got a drinking problem now ?
he 's that guy who gets killed cleaning his own gun .
you are going to use logic and reason
and if all of that doesn 't work , karev , you 're gonna pull out

when 'd you wake up ?
she needs rest .
well , she 's not gonna heal
no , she 's my patient . i don 't care if you 're her husband .
no , really ?
maybe we can go do that first and then go get married after ?
i 'll have nelson do it .
we 'll run to city hall , we 'll come back . and we 'll do it then .
no , you know , let 's go . we gotta go
every day there 's a crisis . there 's no time .
i love you , and i do want to marry you today ,

and in order to do that , we need to make vows ,
i don 't .
passenger train .
i 'm going to have to catch the 6 : 30 departure .
i got to go .
try and get a little sleep .
well , dream of me .
the bomb went off just moments after the commuters boarded .
the death toll is at 144 and still rising .
and all signs point to terrorist leader matthias
the workers of the colony deserve equality .
and with overpopulation figures in the u. f.b. continuing to rise ,
federal police have since attributed that bombing to this man , carl hauser ,
going somewhere ? no ?
that fantasy that remains forever out of reach ?
at rekall , we 'll provide you
all passengers , please report to your designated gates .
wake up to the truth !
don 't let them ship you across the earth like cattle .
despite recent talks between chancellor cohaagen and the colony 's governor ,
the protection of our citizens will always come first .
please prepare for gravity reversal .
looks like that bomb set off a hell of a panic up here .
all factory personnel must enter through security gate 12 .
that mind
do yourself a favor , doug , stay away from them .
remember travis from shift three ?
yeah , i do .
i don 't need to think about it .
it ain 't worth it .
maybe i need my mind messed with .
don 't blame me .
i don 't want to be here any longer than you do , okay ?
so take all your complaints to chancellor cohaagen .
come on .
i trained the last guy you fired .
what are you talking about ?
your memory was erased , your mind was implanted
there is no douglas quaid , there never was .
this ..
deep down , did you really believe
how would i know ?
quaid must 've known we 'd be tracking it .
oh , shit .
he 'd had major tactical training , sir .
how the hell did he get activated ?
been blown before they could get to him .
it means , it means they succeeded in giving you
you have to believe me .
get to my apartment !
loyal
now , what to do with you ?
leave her out of this . i 'm in the fucking chair !
let 's take extra care to follow the instructions , or you 'll be put to sleep .
that 's the day every rule-following citizen gets a free taco and my love !
you have a great day too , president business .
fred , barry , gail , me and yol ?
wait up ! okay , i 'll meet you there .
oh , there you are .
but , uh , i don 't think you 're supposed to be here .
work site closes at 6 , it 's a hard-hat area only .
" tf you see anything weird , report it immediately . "
xoul 'll live . youl 'll be fine .
yes , we 've told him he 'll live so he doesn 't try to escape , but , um ...
wait , what did he just say ?
wait ! there 's obviously been a mix-up here . you 've got the wrong .
no , no , no !
it 's you ?
you 're not the special ! you lied to me !
you 're not even a masterbuilder , are you ?
why don 't you tell me what it is ? that way i could see if you 're right .
look , i 'm sorry , okay ? you just .
and to think i was going to follow you to the end of the universe .
quiet .
do you have any idea what that does to your colon ?
and this . and this . and this .
and what those big words in the sky were all about ?
your home , bricksburg , is one of many realms in the universe .
a bunch of others we don 't need to mention .
tell me the whole thing again . i wasn 't listening
secret super weapon called .... the kragle !
to hunt down all the masterbuilders , who were always changing everything
the only thing that can stop the kragle .
it might have been that cop . he said something about the kragle
i can 't make any sense of it .
i knew that was suspicious . there 's no time to lose .
no , but thank you .
capturing all those masterbuilders ...
thank you , sir .
the one thing that can ruin my plans .
that 's super frustrating
and throw them through this window .
i wanna go it so bad .
and it 's not just you , bad cop , that keeps messing up my plans .
are you gonna be with me .
scon ?
i have a job to do .
ah , perfect .
bang , bang , bang-bang-bang-bang !
zap , zap , zap , pow . zap , pow .
i made a mistake .
not unlike this tv that just showed up magically .
and i thought to myself :
introducing the double-decker couch .
that is literally the dumbest thing i 've ever heard .
there must be something around here ..
if the man urpstairs chose him to be the special
he doesn 't even know about the man upstairs .
that look like they 're made out of big pink sausages ?
wait . you 've seen the . ?
that 's what i was just thinking about .
well , i mean , i wasn 't asleep , so it wasn 't really a dream .
i did
to have even a fleeting glimpse of the man upstairs ..
with proper training
the prophecy chose you , emmet .
that the prophecy says i 'm supposed to do .
then .
yes , i am .
do you think zeppelins are a bad investment ?
wait a minute , partner .
these mechanical birds will get our message out .
torture weapons , poverty , leeches , illiteracy .
dragon !
once we arrive at cloud cuckooland , we 'll raise an army
i call them the dogs . listen to them bark !
i just need to give the secret knock .
i 'm just gonna come right out .
here in cloud curckxooland
thank you .
am very excited to work with you guys ...
and put this thing on the thing .
" really hard "
so if ye think it 'd be a good idea to return .
special .
chan the ideas of 100 .
well , technically i 'm not exactly a masterbuilder yet .
i may not have a lot of experience .
or having ideas in general .
and i 'm not what you 'd call a " creative type . "
also .
i know what you 're thinking :
this is supposed to make us feel better ?
why are you leaving ?
abralam iincoln !
come on , guys !
you 're not even a bit special .
you 're a huge disappointment .
i was wrong
whoa . how did he . ?
i only work in black .
use the yellow bricks !
let 's get these prisoners back to lord business
hello , everybody !
mr. shacuille o 'neal
help us !
we 're stuck in the middle of the ocean on this couch ?
is gonna come out of nowhere and save us .
so why did you come back ?
i watched lord business ' forces completely overlook it .
oh , thank you .
why , this :
don 't like that . sounds weird
but you can 't work together as a team .
but when i had a plan and we were all working together .
now , you 're masterbuilders .
some construction paper ...
i call this
and save the world . ' 
i can get us anywhere .
in a spaceship .
great idea . a bat
in a bat-spaceship , or a pirate spaceship or a rainbow-sparkle spaceship .
that 's exactly like all the other octan delivery spaceships .
sorry , benny . maybe next time .
yeah , but according to your precious instructions .
maybe we could find one !
are you kidding me ?
you know how perturbed i get if we are not punctual .
now hold on , han .
ooh , whoa , i have a boyfriend . and it is super serious . right , babe ?
yeah !
whoa ! babe !
you 're trying to bail on us !
babe ! i knew it ! i knew that .
those guys were so lame . all they did was play space checkers .
and the metal one too . all dudes
so we can get past the dangerous .
space id .
who are you here to see ?
is that last name " butt , " first name " your , " or is it . ?
first try !
and we 'll plunder his collection of relics for disguises .
motion sensors triggered in sector 12 .
whatever you say , boss
and save the universe .
uh , i didn 't mention that earlier ?
no ! but it might not , right ?
attention , everybody ! incoming speaker delivery !
and by the way , i found a few of your friends .
acceptable work , bad cop .
robots , destroy this old man at once .
you must know something about the prophecy .
the prophecy .
uh .. ahem . hey , everybody .
i know things seem kind of bad right now .
this is emmet .
a face in the crowd
and i owe you an apology ...
and even though they seemed weird
than anyone else to saving the universe .
nope , he 's not .
generic construction worker ...
it 's cluttering up my room .
oh , just some mementos of mine .
oh , zima !
what 's zima ?
man , that reminds me of some wild times .
listen , i am done . stop snooping . i 'm going .
oh , images .
i have a name .
you know , we could have some fun with this .
hi , mom .
jay says i can 't leave until i taste it .
what is wrong with you two ?
what is that ? that is a gift for you .
that dog 's chief vick 's . he was .
affection gnawing is what the vet called it .
either way , the chief , gus , and i have come
then you called us to come down here
morrissey ! stop it .
i 'm terribly sorry , dolores .
accepted . hello .
hmm .
guys , i love animals , but i 'm sure you know
two what ?
he 's a tough man with the thick skin
how did either of you reach adulthood ?
okay , i am not a child . what do you want ?
and companionship .
but most importantly , we wanna know what you think
oh , those are for cats .
okay , i 'm gonna be honest with you guys .
all right , here 's the nutshell .
luka , no . no , sweetie .
i should go .
well , this great .
we 're off the hook .
the suicide , the hand turning up behind the hospital
we have to save her from herself .
it means we go back to santa barbara
shawn !
so what 's he doing driving all the way into the hills
no , no , no , ice bar .
they 're either for tourists or eskimos .
let 's go get loaded for lassie .
no , wait , mr. kessler .
i don 't like this , shawn .
well , you 'll just have to be extra black , then .
these mittens are awfully restrictive ,
what we should have done was waited to see if
hello .
we do , but first , i need to go .
thank you for your hospitality , ova .
well , that 's a regional term . gus prefers " playing football . "
now , you 're proving to be dangerous .
shawn , gus , what is going on ?
have you ever seen " dirty rotten scoundrels " ?
hey , could you do a quick pivot
okay . okay .
i got news for everybody .
i 'm not ready for you .
and what does that mean ?
what it means is that i get why you 're here ,
i absolutely will not .
mary , let me ask you ... mary ?
he 's resisting , shawn !
it seems a bit one-sided .
no gills .
you 've just been pretending this whole time ?
i mean , i still have some numbness on my right side ,
why are you doing this ? is this an insurance thing ?
no and no and stop touching my scar , man .
gus . wake up , come on .
what ?
i think baby mary was a hallucination .
yeah .
i mean , the tooth and the van story ,
i stopped taking mine , but it didn 't help .
did you know there are bodies in your fields ?
what ?
they know everything .
hey , look , if they find out that i 'm still lucid ,
but please don 't give me up ,
the lying was killing me . i was having panic attacks .
and apparently i spilled everything
a steep price .
how many of those ice chips did you eat ?
you kept eating them after we knew
ha ! dr. hersch ...
well , hey , guys . how are we doing ?
i get to cover the night rounds
tell me that isn 't the guy i was supposed to be watching .
shawn , will you get your hand off my knee ?
someone from this ice bar
shawn , we 've done this routine before .
gus , please , i 'm going to leave the leash on this time .
ow . good news , bad news .
i saw it with me own eyes .
shot him dead. with a black arrow .
ve must look to our own .
those who can stand , tend to the wounded
what then ? whac ' we do then
bom bur ?
news of the death of smaug will have spread through the lands .
others will now look to the mountain .
what is it you know ?
it 's what i fear may come .
the orc i pursued out of lake-town , i know who he is .
if there is no place for tauriel , there is no place for me .
it is your king 's command .
to where ?
and destroyed once and for all .
sauron can never again hold dominion over middle-earth .
they have no idea what is coming
the battle for the mountain is about to begin .
i know it .
not well enough .
and yet , it is still not found !
the people of lake-town have nothing
i know well enough their hardship .
they have much ... to be grateful for
that 's it .
another one
your gratitude is misplaced .
i came to reclaim something of mine .
white gems of pure starlight .
i know an elf lord who will pay a pretty price for these .
hail , thorin , son of thrain .
why do you come to the gates ... of the king under the mountain armed for war ?
like a robber in his hold ?
my lord
will you not speak with me ?
on behalf of the people of lake-town ..
a share of the treasure .
i will not treat with any man .
does it not tell you our cause is just ?
and in return , you brought upon them only ruin and death .
a bargain was struck !
what choice did we have but to barter our birthright
in mortal danger .
you know nothing ... of wizards .
but sometimes a storm .. is just a storm .
our enemy has summoned his full strength .
because we forced hi .
are the archers in position ?
give the order .
you , bowman !
is gold so important to you ?
it won 't come to that .
to give you ... this .
the king 's jewel .
how is this ... yours to give ?
why would you do this ?
i 'm not doing it for you .
they 're suspicious and secretive ..
not least this faithless woodland sprite .
if he chooses ... to stand between me and my kin
he 's clearly mad , like his cousin .
let 's give these bastards a good hammering !
then my sword is yours to command . get up !
make for the great hall !
with a single coin .
as if i were some lowly dwarf lord
i am not my grandfather . i am not my grandfather .
i lost it .
and i 'm very fond ... of you .
in a wide world after al
4 : 00 , your honor .
well , all these powerful guys .
not really .
that flag outside has been at half-mast since april .
oh . how 's that work ?
this one is for all of the lawyers in the room
oh , hold on .
you don 't see us making you pay ..
okay , hold on . nobody move , i got this !
every car alarm , every whistle of the wind
i just want to netflix and mom .
yeah , thanks again for that , but it didn 't help .
okay , that is it !
i tried to find happiness in the bottom of a bottle .
but enough about how i felt .
for some of us , that was the last best time .
it didn 't make any sense .
a lot of things haunt me .
the roads were very icy .
when i came to , the doctor told me we 'd been in a horrible
mitchell , this is the theater . have some respect .
mitchell , what are you doing ?
oh , my beautiful bess .
never had any children , of course .
to see each of you .
yeah , they never say it .
they find little ways to express it .
you have to learn how to ive on crumbs .
right .
it 's okay .
she invited a few of us out for coffee .
yeah , no , uh , not fun , actually .
it really just seemed like she wanted an audience .
grab it .
joe 's sleeping in the couch .
and that no one discovered the body until it reached acapulco ?
and that they then sent her body back in a rubbermaid cooler ..
before tina 's husband could even claim it
i mean , i write reminders about my reminders .
hey , how is your daughter doing ?
thanks for asking .
yeah , you had pins in your legs for over a year .
your doctor wants me to write an assessment
i have shown up to every fucking appointment .
okay , great .
and all of a sudden , i see a lady climb up on the ledge .
what did you do ?
and i was like , " don 't jump ! don 't jump ! "
it was-it was a pretty long time .
maybe .
or subjective personality traits ,
i just came here for nina 's address .
the one who killed herself . yeah , that nina .
well , remember when i said i was kidding about the iawsuit ?
this is a very good soap . no buy at home .
do you have prescriptions ?
well , at the border , unless you have prescriptions , they will take them away .
we open up mary here .
you 're a rich white woman . have you ever been caught at anything ?
i have problems with anything religious .
they are my friends , irma and innocencia .
excuse me . i 'll be right back .
good-bye .
okay . good-bye , jason .
not tonight. wouldn 't be prudent .
i know . i will call her tomorrow
prove it .
i lied about nina not leaving a note .
silvana told me about your accident .
well , silvana needs to keep her fat mouth shut .
i pay her to care about me .
and don 't you get sentimental either .
i can barely save myself and my kid .
silvama ?
silvana , you have this habit ...
but he is a friend , no ?
one of the last operating drive-in theaters
how about that apple sauce ?
who ?
touche , imelda .
but i do like my shoes .
not in an ironic way .
and i fell over 10,000 feet to the ground .
what 's in la ?
yeah . that 's a sad story .
old enough .
thank you .
as a precaution , no names .
they know me as a banker , slightly bent ,
but before they put their money in ,
50,000 from each of us
not that i expect a straight answer .
well , it 's rather difficult to say
and to your point , um .
oh , dear . the first to break a rule .
russians
i didn 't say that , did i ? mmm ?
uh , no . i wouldn 't want to intrude .
uh , i 've got something to say .
we got off on the wrong foot .
poor sod didn 't even know i was there .
your grandmother 's throwing caution to the wind .
this is your going-away dinner .
that 's right ! one 's interest , one 's assets , family .
i don 't think you could call it a strategy
so , if we include the savings , the fund , and the house ,
may i call you betty ?
is there a risk
so , your money would be helping those in need .
double my money in five years ?
oh , yes , what 's that ?
you mean combine my money with roy 's ?
well , yes , but we were married .
investing with vincent is like winning the lottery
stephen ?
oh , did you ?
why didn 't you let me know you were back ?
stand clear of the doors , please
if the russians were wired
greedy old roy .
give me back my 100,000 quid .
sorry ?
will you say that again ?
i didn 't expect there 'd be quite so many balloons .
still , preferable to being shot at .
i think someone 's getting cranky
i think i 'm gonna go exploring
do you know how many people were shot
i suppose you 're about to tell me .
went the day well ?
oh , it 's just , i took a tumble .
yes . my name 's roy courtnay .
and i 've left my keypad at home .
betty !
oh , robert 's flight was delayed .
he called
oh , i was looking at our joint account .
different passcode , different bank .
agent self will provide that information .
didn 't he say anything about a location ?
which t-bag has .
finding where the break-in is doesn 't mean anything
algeria ? turkey .
you know what ? get with the program .
uh , his name 's erol tabak .
put this on the dash .
that 's our guy .
now , i have something else i need you to do for me .
t-bag 's in town ?
he could be anywhere by now .
he blew this whole thing for all of us .
i wish i were .
leave a message .
call me back . call .. me .. back as soon as possible .
officer mathers , he 'll wait with you .
if you could just wait with me , ma 'am .
what 's going on ?
this is a nice memorial .
there 's a lot of bad people out there .
well , the priority for me is working out custody of benjamin .
no , i don 't want to do this over the phone .
how about we meet in your office in about an hour ?
orson ?
she 's small-time .
wait . so you 're just gonna leave a drug dealer in our house ?
well , good , when they drop by for their inspection ,
and after all , we 're family .
well , yes , since my nephew austin is benjamin 's biological father ,
she went after carlos and mike and karl .
yet .
what are you gonna do ?
you 're the one who asked me to go shopping .
how about this one ?
i just .... it 's good for us to hang out . i enjoy it .
no . all my idea .
let 's go home .
oh , honey , we 're about to have dinner .
but it 's not a competition .
so , howard , are you-interested ?
if i could control robot arms with my brain ,
my ride home with you was hellish .
no , thank you .
well , then out you go .
well , ever since amy started working with howard ,
and has she been home ?
does it frustrate you ?
you know , it 's okay to feel frustrated
ah , maybe it 's not that big a deal .
now , why don 't you go wash up ,
howard 's really excited about his work ,
come on , we don 't need to lie to each other .
i have a teething baby , i 'm pregnant ,
no , no , no . he 'll just think that means
okay . let 's see , let 's see .
well , sometimes , but .. problem for another day .
" let him have ownership of his choices .
" i can drive you in two hours or you can take an uber "
wow , it worked .
and now they 're working on a saturday ?
this whole thing is maddening .
i don 't have time to listen to you complain .
" sheldon , why are you here ? "
sounds like we 've earned ourselves a break .
you know , that 's your greatest magic trick ,
okay , look , i 'm on the air force web site ,
oh , please , that 's not how it works .
the military just shows up and takes over .
i 'm sorry , you find this funny ?
boy , that was terrible .
when are they gonna fix your elevator ?
all right , you two , don 't start .
can you please not ruin it ?
this is how the u.s. military works .
it could be foreign military pretending to be american .
i also love the enemies of america .
oh , of course not .
so , alfred , what is it that you do for a living ?
i study ancient peoples and cultures .
he probably feels
there 's two pages just for desserts .
all fright .
howard , keep in mind that the more passionately
hi . sorry i 'm late .
i 'll get you a plate .
oh , yes , the waitress slash actress
well , he sent me a football and a catcher 's mitt for christmas ,
yeah , i gotta put a sticker over that .
oh , not at all .
come on , i mean , you 're not upset
sure , sure .
eight years ?
i 've been responsible for my own orgasms since 1982 .
what 's so funny ?
do you want to stop for a drink ?
it 's a conversation starter .
oh , is it ? we 're conversing .
what i want is to be departing the starship enterprise
i 'll comfort you from over here .
thank you , that 's very comforting .
it 's not ?
the comforting part is that the germans
you 're right , i do feel better .
just remember , leonard , where your biological family
if it 's any consolation , i 'm not happy about it either .
okay , now this time try drinking it all at once .
i 've been responsible for my own buzz since 2003 .
not my business .
we the left-eye boys !
you got real pretty eyes , miss .

who are you , slick ? the boyfriend ?
he did mention a singing windmill .

whatever that was .
he liked to laugh ...
my father is in trouble .
i 'll rob the bank with you .
what 's happening right now ?
will you stop brushing me if i say yes ?
then you can help .
that 's a good amount of money you want us to lend you .
i feel kinda guilty about this , burro , taking money from nice people .
i feel less guilty now .
this is a bank !
i know what you 're thinking , but not yet .
how is this jackass stuck ?
it doesn 't make sense , it 's not logical .

how can you see a fly in the dark ?
that was some mystical shit , man .
that 's what i was aiming for .
he deserved to know he was not welcome here .
that had some impact on you .
that 's wonderful .
i did .
i thought that , like , tonight was gonna be fajita friday
he 's giving himself six bullets to the head !
i was just trying to knock him out .
i don 't think he 's waking up from that one .
you did ! you did a number there .
hey ! hey !

this little beauty stumbled into our camp a few days ago .

wait , this kid 's half kardashian .
wow , that baby 's already famous for doing nothing ..
no , what i found is a site where we can apply
there 's also a minority-owned category .

i hate asking men for things .
you were born here ? how old are you ?
yeah , you were born in a walmart , right ?
hey . caroline .
for the record , i did not chase andy away .
right , that 's why i helped him move out
so self-involved .
he left last night without a peep .
oh , i was worried you two wouldn 't make it .
okay , fine . give it back .
what about sophie ? she owns a small business ,
i mean , when we worked for her ,

i didn 't see it coming . i 'm so sorry .
oh , honey .
and i 'm the only kid with his mom ,
what can i do to make it better ?
how was soccer ?

you do realize that that could be awkward for me .

you don 't want me going on this research trip
on land .
because of all the drowning .

you know , one of the things
i have a request to make .
i want to cut open your brain

that 's , uh , b-flat , for those who don 't have perfect pitch .
he has been presented with a wonderful opportunity ,
well , i mean it .
and that 's how you get a toothpaste commercial . cheers .
it was really nice of you to try to be happy for leonard .
you 're joking , right ?
i joke about golf and mexicans .
first time 's the hardest .
well , i 'm not sure i 'm ready to say good-bye to this guy yet .
i did bring along a fabulous bottle of ' 82 bordeaux

phil dunphy .
oh , dunphy , i can play you like a ukulele ,
let me stop you right there .
first of all , i 'm gonna take you out to a very nice dinner .
and then i 'm gonna lay you down by the fire ...
if you guys are talking about the house ,
she knows so much more about the things that he loves .
if she learns how to froth his cappuccino ,
hell , he may never form
and it doesn 't matter if manny likes her .
you are wrong , jay . i 'm not going to dump her .
you 're going to marry her ?
nailed it .
she is the most amazing woman i 've ever known .
please .
trish is the one . and manny already loves her .
but you owe me $ 8
me , too .
trish and i are getting married .
here . drink .
no , no . i 'll just push a little harder .
but wait , my love .
that 's him . hit it .
hey , guys . sorry it took me so long .
do we really need that much ?
showtime !
hey ! thought i 'd just swing by and see how it 's going .
oh , my god .
alex was right . you are into him .
we go see around city .
i mean , it will cost a fortune .
not another crap gameno , stud poker this time .
how did you get all the money to play in such a big poker game ?
i 'm telling you this is why i have to go to vegas .
i 've always wanted you to have to show me around manhattan .
roland , this is ashleigh enright from yardley .
the screening is all set up . we are running on a really tight schedule .
i just want to say you 're by far the most interesting american director .
i write in the arts for a paper
film is my total thing . i 've seen all the american classics .
technically , he is not european , technically , he 's , obviously , japanese .
what college are you from ?
i know it well , my first wife went there .
to tell you the truth i didn 't deserve her , and
neither , either , nor yawn .
i guess , it 's probably more yawn that either .
tucson , arizona .
i was afraid you 'd ask .
is that bad ?
" republicans , the one percent . " but we are not .
that 's how my ashley was .
my first wife .
face saving changes .
i guess i could shift my lunch plans .
you cannot achieve this level of anxiety , hostility and paranoia anywhere else .
anyhow , i decided to treat myself to a cigarette holder ,
so then who do i meet , but one of the most obnoxious
troller .
no , i didn 't hear about that . the big deal .
he could commit mass murder and he 'd still have a cushy job waiting for him .
which , i 'll never understand , because she resembles yasser arafat .
you can 't believe everything .
it 's my girlfriend , i 'm just showing her around for the weekend .
flat-chested . like two dimes on a hanging board .
what are you in town for ?
who 's that ?
oh yeah ! i can 't stand his flicks .
they 're looking for volunteers .
i 'm running a little bit late .
good to know .
i 'm only pre-med .
i can 't make lunch .
i have to see his film . you do ?
and then we 're going to discuss it after and everything .
just kiss me so i can really feel it in my toes .
i don 't know , i don 't recall . i think maybe she said you were a 4 .
maybe a 6 , i can 't recall . just this kiss , i want it to be hot .
good work ethic . thank you .
cut .
i have a girlfriend , chan . i don 't think i can do this .
you have a girlfriend who 's your girlfriend ?
she 's from tuscon originally .
don 't do this .
your changes are shit . rollie , sit down .
mr. pollard .
thank you for coming , ashleigh , i need to get a little air .
i need to think about . don 't ! no booze .
come on .
it 's a process , we do this every time . ted , ted .
oh , god .
he 's not at the hotel and he didn 't show up for the press interview , so
me too . tell him , you ... tell him , tell roland .
i 'm always at this end of the argument , but you are fresh ,
come on , let 's find him . are you okay ?
and we were supposed to have this ...
parked down with all these interviews for the school paper .
one , it was supposed to be one little ... one tiny little , lousy , hour intervew .
would you just relax ?
because this was going to be a special weekend .
wandering streets , like hagar in a goddamn desert or something .
you want to drink some wine , walk in the rain and give her bronchitis .
she takes her job very seriously , alright ?
i 'm in the process of getting over it .
i 've never really thought about it . i don 't know .
then maybe you better step in and assert yourself .
these are like movie big shots she 's hanging out with .
artists , they are usually passionate .
okay , you 're right , i have to call her now .
you think there 's that much of a rush , i don 't know .
it 's your idea .
there 's nothing you can say . what do you mean ?
christ , chan , you just encouraged me to call her .
we have a number of things planned for today .
but , i really , i can 't explain it over the phone .
what could possible be so secretive about that ?
unless there 's some funny business going on ?
oh , these , goddamn , cellphones are ...
it sounds dubious to you because you have sinister mind .
she 's charming and delightful . she 's pretty .
she sings very nicely . she plays the flute .
but i 'm sick of hearing about her , okay ?
gatsby . yeah .
he goes to yardley too .
he 's not really focused professionally .
a broadway bookiehe 's a little eccentric .
she was always forcing him to read everything , and learn piano ...
he was one of those students who ...
sounds like me .
don 't tell anybody , but i think he has a touch of asperger 's .
what are you doing now ? why ?
and i thought about going to modern museum .
oh , i see . you have nothing better to do so you want me to keep you company ?
you 've always had a little bit of an attitude , okay ?
i have to check out some paintings at the mat 's profession class .
i don 't know why you couldn 't have just ...
i 'd give you an arizona lunch , but we are all out of beef jerky .
my folks are in east hampton for the weekend .
i 've got a date tonight .
you wouldn 't know him , he 's a girlfriend 's dermatologist .
don 't forget to show him those three irregular black moles on your back .
i really hope i won 't regret not going to the hamilton 's .
which clock ?
i love it , it 's very old movie .
and she never comes .
can 't they just kiss in the rain ?
picture yourself . okay .
you 're pacing up and down , rain drops have just started to fall .
expecting your ...
but he just diagnosed a carcinoma in his own limp .
he meets me , holds me , kisses me .
connie !
is this how you are shopping with judy in connecticut ?
i happen to see you out the window , from the car .
i 'm 21 . she 's 21 .
i have a proof of age , actually . no , you don 't need this .
really , can i write this down ?
ask him how many times he has been unfaithful to me ?
stop filling her head with lies . ashleigh , come here .
find rollie . i don 't know my way around new york .
i know and i loved that . i loved hearing every detail .
i thought you were a special idiot .
i remember amy came home and she told me that you took her to
now i embarrassed .
she said you were a little tense .
but very romantic . okay .
that was the best part .
she started sneezing . i don 't really remember that part .
you always were around , giving me the fish eye .
that 's all you have to say ?
you seemed fine .
amy would make her entrance , like a , goddamn , miss america .
she is , she was an actual first-place winner at her high school in tuscon .
yes , how did you guess ?
get in , get in . where are we going ?
come on , give us a break ! come on ! no !
make yourself at home .
would you like a drink , no thanks .
would i like to have what with you ?
you and i can go to a party together .
what about tiffany griffinl though ...
i 'm going to change into my street clothes .
oh , gosh .
why is that so bad ?
i noticed you haven 't renounced your family 's money .
that means you could move out .
oh yeah , as of what ?
or , maybe a poker player , dice hustler ?
there is something romantic about gamblers .
yeah , maybe in movies , but this is real life .
at least he knows enough not to wind up in the egyptian tomb .
thanks for being here . it is always like this ?
i 'm just signing one . thank you , thank you for being here .
francisco , who is the young lady , i 'm no one .
let 's go , come on .
okay , thank you . thank you for being here .

please be honest , but be modest .
and how ?
i become loose , uninhibited .
absurd .
is this where the poker game is ?
who ? he 's okay , that 's hunter 's brother .
yeah , hunter called and said you might sit in .
he 's alright . hunter says he 's a shark .
this kid is loaded . have a seat then , my friend .
this is crazy . maybe something 's happened to her ?
raise , two thousand .
maybe she was kidnapped or murdered .
of course , it would be so embarrassing if she turn up alive .
i raise you .
it will be heavy at times .
on a brighter note : francisco vega is in town
they were spotted later having drinks over candle light , and
good luck , francisco , we are all rooting for you .
jesus , i need a drink .
what i really need is a berlin ballad .
yeah , why don 't you make it a double .
it 's okay , i won 't be operating any form of machinery .
mom , you have to give me a chance . i said i was going to be there tonight .
yes , i 'll wear a tie and i 'll be there on time , okay ?
francisco vega . a bullshit actor .
yeah , unfortunately , it flies , coach .
it 's not always a comfortable trip .
what are you doing here all alone ?
what do you do ?
what kind of party ?
i won 15 g 's in the poker game and i need a date with me .
i hope i 'm dressed okay . absolutely .

we got in a sort of a crazy conversation .
now i feel closer to her .
the oldest profession .
that 's the second oldest .
don 't you ?
ow , i just bit my tongue .
i 'd stop doing that right now .
congratulations .
my teeth don 't know where to go .

we thought you ran away .
i had quite a day .

i got this at a corner deli .
she said it was good .

seriously , we should go .
i think me and your tub are going steady .
i don 't know who found who ,
giving up everything that you had .
all of it . the tub .
you 're kind of a badass .

but it 's too late for that now.yeah .
people murdered by government operatives ...
what do you mean ? they 're not going after the president ;

this isn 't about magic .

if we don 't hear anything by morning ,
mom , what happened ?
oh , well . we cried
well , have you talked to him about it ?
i know . i know phil 's not the brightest crayon in the box .
that 's what i kind of like about him , you know ?
i know that sounds perverse , but he 's kind of like my dad in that way .
i 'm gonna get straight c 's !
phil is literally the boy next door .
he was so dull and stupid . i made fun of him .
but then , one night that summer ,
oh , my god .
look what the bats dragged in .
oh , shit , he 's coming over here .
guys , be cool . come on .
sorry , i didn 't know anyone was here .
hey .
okay .
he 's a nice boy .
he 's rented a tux , and everything
god , i have no idea .
she had no other choice , maybe ?
i guess life with my father must have been pretty bleak and miserable for her .
what do you mean , different ?
okay . sorry to bother you , mrs. connors .
all right .
well ,
one day i hope some musky macho stud will fuck the shit out of me too .
oh , yeah . when ? when ?
why ? because i fucked an old guy ?
oh , my god . what are you talking about ?

mr. connor , this is sheryl from the loma linda police department .
thank you for your cooperation , and have a nice day .
i have no idea .

go to bed , mom .
seriously , just go back to bed .
so ? that 's enough to know that he 's hot , and smart ,
yeah , that was enough .
oh , yeah . i 'd say so . i mean , i definitely feel more comfortable in my own skin .
and i assume you haven 't heard from your mother .
i don 't know . it 's kind of gotten to the point where
kat , this is may . may , kat .
i 've heard so much about you .
dad , i told you i am thrilled that you met someone .
took off your wedding ring
why bother ? i mean , mom left us .
it 's about time we et on with our lives .
whac ?
there was a spoon at the bottom of the sink , and
nothing .
oh , yeah ?
hardly ever talk about your mother .
i don 't think i agree with that .
you really want my opinion ?
exhaustive ? you guys barely even looked for her .
not a single trace was ever found .
so where do you think she is ?
what ?
we did a thorough background check on your father .
my dad is a fucking wimp .

it 's good you 're using your initiative , though it shows planning ahead .
it 's just , erm
i had four drivers in here last week .
second driver , his sister had a stroke .
fourth driver , his daughter tried to commit suicide .
my old man was a farmer . he milked cows .
do you wanna know why ' m number one ?
they couldn 't sive a shit if you fall asleep at the wheel

patron saint of nasty bastards .

i can 't have that
once that line 's crossed , you can 't go back .

it would be harsh . you should prepare yourself .
which means every surgeon in this room
see you in the or .
get out of here
you pretending like nothing happened ?
hunt literally tried to kill you .
that doesn 't mean you have to stand by .
so how is it anymore acceptable that i walk away from this ?

from your lips to god 's ears
oh , yeah ? i 'm not the one who needs help around here .
i 'm not the one who half this hospital is talking about

you really think i 'm gonna be here a year from now ?
forceps .
i 'm gonna see your dick
yeah , but it does put people with the one .
but how do you know they 're perfect matches ?
each time you get a little bit more pliable ,
and then you have to live the rest of your life
every crazy thought you 've ever had ,
right . so if it 's everything in your head ..
all right , so now you 're gonna say :
once shortened , the expiry date cannot be extended .
everything happens for a reason .
so what does she want ?
she 's just walking around , asking everybody ,
go sit back down with your horn .
there 's something wrong with it .
everett !
i don 't know what you said , fay .
penny , give me your horn .
so it 's not broken ?
double-dealing devil-dog . that had me so scared .
you can always do that if someone 's a wet rag .
well , i can 't do that to someone .
it 's stopping someone from embarrassing themselves .
putting up the numbers means
i 'm sorry , you two . i 'm gonna need to see a license for that .
then come up with some other way to fill up this tape recorder .
although , i was enjoying it back there
tell me the craziest caller you ever had .
not about a caller , but about

you don 't believe me , do you ? you 're just pulling my leg .
i love it . i 'm interviewing you . i 'm playing a part .
do we have time to do those two ?
all right , if you like that , brace your brain for this .
you tell me all about it .
hold on , ' cause i wanna read it to you the way it was written ,
so , " picture a man in new york city , in times square .
they were tall .
yeah .
maybe there 's a couple of families ,
and i don 't mean that because they 're indians .
that means we 're gonna lose .

arlo 's working on it though .
all right , i 'm off .
okay , bye .
no , i was watching tv .
like what ?
something that just came in through the board
all right . connect it .
i 've never heard that before .
she said there was something going on out of town
and when did you say my show got cut into ?
but this one ... worried me .
probably ' cause it was so secretive .
well , we built the ceiling over this thing , carefully .
and when the propellers had started spinning
the same sound you just played tonight .
oh , i couldn 't forget it .
and then the sound disappeared and we got further away .
and in the next few weeks ,
and i think whatever. that area of the desert
you work at the radio station ?
it was something in the sky .
i do the new ...
i don 't like new stuff , but gerrie does .

if there ever was a rainmaker there
and no one from strike operation to the fentagon ..
whoever it was had the confirmation codes
defense knows the tapes are missing ..
any of these men could 've destroyed the hut tapes .
but the prosecution it 's inability to produce hut tapes .
excuse me , your honor ,
but even more significant than that
but god help the u.s. navy if they 're allowed to remain in it .
is to resign your commision
thank you , but no .
looks like you could use some .
and one from being broke .
i might end up working for you . alright ?

oleg . give my regards to nina .
your corrupt and criminal background ...
but what interests me , given your profile ,
what 's he doing here ?

and naturally , you 'd introduce him
jack deveny ,
i think your feet are a little small .
dearest .

why do you think they have radiation tools and suit
we wouldn 't have found that without my father 's watch .
be my guest .
oh , don 't be so hard on yourself .
the fault doesn 't lie in your performance .
she gave you up like an unwanted kitten .
and how is that ?
the russians and the americans thought they were using me ,
she seemed so innocent .
it 's a tracking device .
i 'm sure my ..
i think i need to make a telephone call .
i 've been here before .
i 'm afraid that isn 't going to stop you getting hurt .
only my mother calls me napoleon .
what history has failed to relate

there 's a short in the wiring
my apologies .
i 'm so sorry i can 't stay to finish you off myself .
and i want it to be slow

because of this boy 's apparent shortcomings ,
but what the other boys didn 't understand about their victim
there are two kinds of torture , mr. solo .

you told gaby to drop us in it
well , that is a very poor translation , solo , but ...
thank you very much .
well , it 's known as a coupler .
t 's left over from when this was a warhead
i 'm sorry .
those are the words we 've been waiting to hear .
let 's both stop playing games , shall we ?

he tried to cut me on my side .
then he grabbed my hands and made me cut chris .
jessie , on wednesday , may 5 , 1993 , early in the morning ,
then i went with them up to the ... up to the robin hood .
this is paul ford from tonesboro .
and val price is the public defender who 's been appointed
does that surprise you ?
got any experts lined up ?
he was once diagnosed as mentally retarded .
in my experience , most of them are .
because if you don 't have a strong case ,
and i worry about that baby .
because of the rumor that they 're going to sacrifice it to satan .
you 're working for them ? what are you , like a lawyer 's assistant ?
but you won 't be representing me in court .
so i 'm just supposed to trust you ? tell you everything
they will do anything to get people to say what they want to hear .
why did those girls say people were witches back in salem ?
i did that with a knife . that 's my girlfriend 's name .
why ?
through drinking the blood of others .
i 've been doing it since i was , ike , 10 jears old .
and everybody knows they .... i heard from a bunch of people
you don 't dress like that when you ... when you , um ....
did he like scouting ?
i saw you on tv .
you 're supposed to be in mourning .
what 's that supposed to mean ?
acting like a goddamn silly fool .
is that what you 've been doing ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
you shut up !
go ahead . hit me . hit me . i dare you , hit me .
i need to talk to you about something , in person .
it 's really important . okay . good night .
jessie started running and caught steve .
then , um , they took them ,
and nobody knows what happened but me .
may i have a tea , please ?
it 's good to hear from you ,
then they came by my office ,
i was so insulted , i was so angry ,
ta 's fine
it 's just that with all the paperwork in the case ,
the police seem so certain . are you sure you want to do this ?
it 's just that sometimes you take these things so personally .
you know , if the police are so goddamned certain about their case
ron , please don 't .
all the way down to ten mile bayou .
we ought to just fry him and get it over with .
crawled on my hands and knees and felt along with my hands
uh , yes , sir . i played this .
and after hearing the tape , what was the defendant 's reaction ?
then he said that he was present when the boys were murdered .
the verdicts read as follows .
" and of second degree murder in the deaths of christopher byers
do you think it was a just and a proper sentence ?
it 's one down , two to go .
and they prayed to their devil and they prayed to their satan ,
there 's a war going on .
yeah . he did do something strange . very strange .
so when were you planning on telling us about it ?
but you 've known about it for months . how could you not tell us about it ?
there was blood on the knife .
you feature prominently in the prosecution 's case .
no . no , i can 't talk about it .
detective donald bray ?
michael moore and chris byers are his two best friends .
i 'd say it 's very possible . right , honey ? it is possible .
he told us about the meetings in the woods .
you knew about the cult ?
questioned vicki .
she said no .
jessie !
it 's all right .
but did you ever find any evidence to corroborate
no physical evidence . but we got something e se .
so vicki 's plan failed , right ?
yeah , but vicki 's plan got jessie involved ,
and jason baldwin gets caught in the net just by picking the wrong friend .
are they gonna put aaron on the stand ?
oh , but they did hear from him .
" nobody knows what happened but me . "
look at this .
this police report was signed by detective ridge
this is a goddamn witch hunt .
and once they set their sights on jason and damien ,
whatever it takes .
nobody will . nobody but you .
washing away your sins . calling on the name of the lord .
nd how were you accepted into enrollment at columbia pacific university ?
did you have to fill out a little flyer like this ?
did you know this was a correspondence school ? i didn 't .
we object to dr. griffis as an expert .
what do you want me to do ? do you want me to lie to you ?
and all the other bullshit .
chris !
your honor , may we approach ?
my understanding was that this young man retracted his statement .
why would his testimony be relevant ?
i 'm not gonna allow you to drag in every possible suspect
your honor , they could just talk to anybody on the street and they could say ,
this was the oceanside pd
i 'm gonna ask you .... .
... to go back to the jury room .
bobby deangelo asked for a picture of my son and

plus , i 'm trying to put my story behind me .

that it moved the main island of japan eight feet .
that occur around the globe each year .
the earth shook for five straight minutes .
and that 's not the biggest earthquake ever recorded .
bam .
.. that leveled hilo , hawaii 8000 miles away .
so , um ..
it 's the demarcation line between two tectonic plates that are constantly moving
.. i 'd say it 's not a matter of if .
how soon before you get her fixed ?
elgin , you move any faster , you 're gonna break that hip .
yeah . leaving tomorrow . driving her back up to school .
i figure we cruise up the coast . do a little camping .
now , we got a rare low-level seismic swarm out in falco , nevada .
where the hell is talco , nevada ?
all right .
any known faults . now , if we get there while the mini quakes continue
then we 're predicting them . then we are predicting them .
let 's go check it out .
i was wondering if there was room for my bike .
that 's a great idea . i 'm sure i could figure out a way to fit it in .
lake havasu city , needles , blythe and laughlin also suffered major damage .
is expected to begin arriving in the next 24 hours .
i know . i 'm so sorry . we 're heading out tomorrow .

blake
she 's a nice addition to the san francisco skyline , don 't you think ?

nothing important . what 's going on ?
no , ray , really .
i just wasn 't ready to hear about you and blake moving in with someone else .
hey , how 's blake feel about it ? you know .
i think it 's gonna be hard for her to ..
oh , my god . we 're having an earthquake .
lawrence , the richter just jumped from a 6.5 to an 8.5 .
powers of ten !

and it 's heading toward san francisco .
okay .
bye , blake . it was nice meeting you , as well .
oh , and , um ...
tell ben that i 'll put in a good word for him .

they knew l.a. was going to get hit .
jt 's time now to listen .
damage all the way up in san francisco .
in the central valley .
more importantly , people need to know that the shaking is not over .
san francisco will get hit again .
our models are predicting a 9.5 or greater .
you will feel it on the east coast .
and , if you can 't , you need to find any means possible ...
ii doesn 't matter .
what 's the point ?
and then coming home every day to you and blake only made it harder .
it was perfect .
i just didn 't know how .
i really am .
then nobody could have
let 's go ! keep it moving ! let 's go !

i started wearing it after she died .
i 'm so sorry . i didn 't mean ... no . it 's okay

ts this it
here we go .
we can listen in , we can see what 's going on .
the coast guard is asking anyone with access to a boat to please volunteer .
their end of the fault line has not moved yet .
i hope we 've given everyone enough warning .
right now , i wanna be so wrong
but pray for the people of san francisco .
. " which means ' rich or wealthy . ' 
oh , no .
now , where are you , baby ? where are you ?
oh , shit .

he 's 10 . who 's the parent here ?
at least i don 't hover over him ,
what were you thinking , dropping him
he just wanted to give your spoiled daughter
we barely survived the head lice he gave her .

let them be cute , for crying out loud .
she 's breathing funny .
no ! no ! no !
no , i 'm not ! i promised clem i 'd stay with her !
you 're too big for this .
i 'm a little embarrassed for you .
what 's clem gonna think if she wakes up and i 'm gone ?
uh .. look , uh ...
i 'll tell her whatever you want .
promise ?
you 're gonna need a pen and a pad of paper .
pathology 's back .
no pathology seen .
there 's a chance the other one 's clean , too .
nd pledge myself to thee forever .
for making me feel so at home .
so , thank you for being so welcoming and wonderful .
he 'd carry it on his shoulder like this .
i 'm being serious ! this is a beautiful event ..
we were in the same foster home together for a year .
so , here 's to happily ever after .
mmm .
sam .
this was the most perfect day .
how did we get home last night ?

i 'm just hungry .
i 'll be right there . whoa . whoa ! whoa !

it 's okay . it 's okay .
so , i figured i 'd just get a couple of classes going ...
you don 't want to just wait until the fall ?
okay , i was just thinking because ..
no , i know . but the baby is coming in march .
we 're not putting everything on hold indefinitely .
but if i stop doing it now ...
i 'm gonna be stuck in this house
i 'm gonna be natalie , and i don 't want to be her .
that 's what it 's turning into . i know that ..
okay .
i don 't know . the guy in the cab ?
he was like our cab driver , on our honeymoon .
look at this .
whoa , what the fuck ?
it 's gone .
ti was literally just looking at this shit right before you
fuck !
because everything i 've seen says they 're , uh , religious symbols .
and then there 's that .
these are the only ones i 've actually seen in person .
first john , 2 : 18 .
these are from early , early religion . these are
these families are suffering from starvation due to overcrowding .
when will the bloodshed come to an end ?
i came so you could explain to me in person why , in the middle of a war ...
i 'm sure you can understand why we haven 't been able to leave .
you were ordered to shut down .
you were army intelligence before you joined us ..
you don 't want to go back .
it 's the inactivity that sucks .
well , it 's something .
makes sense to me . what else are we good for ?
why don 't you put that in your letter ? hm ?
okay . you ready to do this ?
we don 't want your fascist war ! we don 't need your draft no more !
we don 't we need your draft no more !

ramon , you okay ?
and a truck that only you have the keys to . what ?
inside job ? i don 't know shit about this .
dave .
only then will he destroy xandar for me .
it will be my honor .
if this happens again , you 'll be facing our father
just like you .
all of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid ,
can you believe they call us criminals ,
and told me to tell you ,
it 's my policy never to discuss my clients , or their needs .
an occupational hazard , i 'm sure , in your line of work .
ronan ? i 'm sorry , mr. quill .
but i want no part of this transaction if ronan is involved .
a kree fanatic , outraged by the peace treaty ,
farewell , mr. quill .
what happened ?
if there 's one thing i hate , it 's a man without integrity .
you have the bearing of a man of honor .
people say it about me , all the time ,
you gotta be kidding me .
i live for the simple things .
i 'm sorry .
what a bunch of a-holes .
i guess most of nova corps wanna uphold the laws ,
i 've had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years .
hold
ain 't no thing like me , except me .
it 's like i said
she 'll last a day , tops .
the guards will protect her , right ?
they don 't care what we do to each other inside .
check out the new meat .
he killed my family .
of course , drax . here , i .
i 'm no family to ronan or thanos .
woman , your words mean nothing to me !
crap .
are you not the man this wench attempted to kill ?
look , this is from a smoking-hot rajak girl .
this is a symbol for you slicing his throat .
would cut his head clean off
you have been betrayed , ronan .
gamora may yet recover the orb .
you are the one here with nothing to show for it .
lower your tone !
i only ask that you take this matter seriously .
your politics bore me .
i shall honor our agreement , kree ,
thanks , dad . sounds fair .
let 's head to the kyln .
and to do that , i 'm gonna need a few things .
tt was one time , man .
spare me your foul gaze , woman .
we promised him he could stay by your side until he kills your boss .
i was just kidding about the leg .
what ?
was it funny ?
i had to transfer him 30,000 units !
well , he 's got a plan .
i have a plan ! i have a plan !
hey !
that 's for if things get really hardcore .
no one 's blowing up moons .
so , listen , i 'm gonna need your buyer 's coordinates .
if we 're gonna work together , you might try trusting me a little bit .
i 'd trust you a lot more if you told me what this was .
i don 't know what it is .
i am not a princess !
nobody is killing anybody on my ship !
i have no interest in money .
that means more money for the three of us .
she has no idea .
i swear . i don 't know where they went ! i swear .
yeah
the nova can 't know what we 're after .
do you got any other cute little buggers like this one ?
i can 't tell if you 're joking or not .
but first , you gonna tell me what this orb is ,
sir , the high-end community is a .
it 's a tight-knit .
the high-end community is a very tight-knit
carina
we do , master .
i don 't have to remind you
heads up ! we 're inbound .
there are no regulations whatsoever here .
bone , brain tissue , spinal fluid .
it 's dangerous and illegal work , suitable only for outlaws .
billy the kid ,
yeah , you should .
can you spare any units ?
we are to wait here for his representative .
this is no respectable establishment .
now , let 's put more of this liquid into our bodies .
man , you wouldn 't believe what they charge for fuel out here .
my connection is making us wait .
where yours is more ,
when he said he was going to destroy an entire planet for ronan ,
my mom liked sharing with me all the pop songs that she loved growing up .
the day that she
do ? nothing . you listen to it . or you can dance .
really ?
her body mods should keep her alive a couple more minutes ,
in a second , we 're gonna be in the same boat .
i saw you out there .
but i couldn 't let you die .
i mean , not to brag
whac
quill just got himself captured .
you 're right .
the lunatic on top of this craft is holding a hadron enforcer .
what the hell ?
a very big new one !
rocket , it 's me , for god sakes !
hey , quill . what 's going on ?
we 're gonna rob the guys who just beat us senseless .
how about trying to save us by blowing us up ?
and how on earth were they gonna turn us over
i have part of a plan !
you don 't get to ask questions
we 've already established
like three seconds ago !
she 's right . you don 't get an opinion .
i don 't know . twelve percent .
that 's a fake laugh .
it 's barely a concept .
i am groot .
thank you , groot . thank you .
guys .
yondu is gonna be here in two seconds .
i need your help .
you know what i see ?
i , for one , am not gonna stand by and watch
you 're asking us to die .
quill .
i will be grateful to die among my friends .
i will fight beside you .
i am groot .
now i 'm standing . y 'all happy ?
the bigger the target , the bigger the power surge .
all plants , animals ,
so ronan does not make the surface .
then , our craft and yondu 's will enter .
i think of sakaaran as paper people .
which i can disable by dismantling the power source .
we 'll never make it up there !
for the record , i advised against trusting you here .
denarian saal , should we break formation
we 'll take care of the people down here .
star-ord
youir friends have arrived .
if you will follow denarian dey ,
your wife and child shall rest well knowing that you have avenged them .
time ? 2pm .
i 'm sorry . i 'm disturbing you .
um , well , beavers eat tree bark .
so , i 'll say cinnamon .
obviously , the answer is cheese danish .
in a world ruled by a giant beaver ,
thousands die .
this is ridiculous .
is he always like this when he loses ?
you should 've been here for the great giant tantrum of 2008 .
perhaps it would be kinder to play a game more suited to his abilities .
i 'm going to my room .
but next time , don 't tell us where you 're hiding .
that 's a little vulgar for the dinner table , don 't you think ?
potty " is innocent . " potty " is adorable .
if i don 't have to boom-boom .
you all remember amy farrah fowler .
i got it . but what i was going for was , you know , how 's your life ?
subject to entropy , decay and eventual death .
why is she not taking our order ?
it 's how they lure you in .
so , this is nice .
my relationship with amy was purely intellectual ,
okay . good .
i gotta tell you guys ,
no , i mean since the shamy hit a reef .
you should go ' cause you want to go ,
can i want to go
yeah , but now , wait .
or whatever i have to want ?
all right .
you know , i haven 't seen rai in several days .
and if so , should we be interviewing for a replacement ?
he 's just decided he 's never leaving his apartment again .
he 's upset because he can 't get anywhere with women .
it 's just ..
really ?
a little ? try 45 minutes .
so ... you know how it 's called a hot stone massage ?
i know !
but at this point , i 'm like ,
so ... what 's on the agenda here ?
mm . right , right . so who 's doing what for that ?
it 's so nervous every time i walk into this class .
between you and me ,
i mean , like this morning ,
well , here 's an idea . don 't go in that room .
you know what ? we 're both stressed .
no , thanks . i 've been hitting that stuff
well , after the day i had ,
" you should be sad and miserable and on time ,
they 're jealous .
it 's nothing fancy , but , uh , i 'm proud to say
this is exactly what i 'm looking for .
you know , embezzlement , adultery .
i suppose i could ask you the same thing .
i 've just been feeling disconnected lately .
if i may .
we don 't have time for that .
yes , because we all know
would you be offended
oh , dear . i guess il 'll have to keep it simple .
holy crap !
coincidence or not ? you decide .
you said you wouldn 't judge .
it 's full of guys who photoshop hair on their heads
a bar ? oh , i don 't know .
well , i 'm afraid you 're gonna have to leave .
is that a good thing ?
" homey but refined ,
which is also a good thing .
hold on .
let me get you a refill .
it just really helps
then ..
yeah .
learn it and throw it away .
oh , my god .
isn 't this the day we were ..
reverend sykes . what a nice surprise !
i practically had to fight my way in .
thank you so much for suggesting i get involved .
the intention of charity
feeling important 's just a bonus .
i was hoping you could tell me
no , bree .
why ? i was just trying to make this place special .
hey , we 're still eating .
you certainly look like you can afford to .
we made this place a success . "
this food isn 't for you .
so please , pack up your laptops
ben , i 'm sorry . i have made a terrible mess of things .
you think you can make a speech that good again tomorrow ?
norman rockwell would walk down this street
by the way , i , uh , checked my e-mail ,
oh , my god , you are so out of touch .
you don 't understand the kinds of things real people deal with .
fine . i don 't need your help .
this event is going off without a hitch .
hello ?
whoa . what 's going on ?
five . five kids .
i actually have a husband , too , but we 're separated ,
now what do we do ?
but my ex got all my cds .
okay , before you say " no ... "
howdy , folks .
i 'm the sheriff of dodge .... ball .
have you seen the shape some of these folks are in ?
look , this is the " dolphin den . "
anything 's got to be better than this .
we 're really not supposed to , but you know what ?
let me just do this on the board ,
yes !
thank you ! thank you so much !
well , i hope you 're happy .
if i pull that off , will you die ?
you 're a big guy .
was getting caught part of your plan ?
dr. pavel refused our offer in favor of yours .
sir ?
crashing this plane .
this city has seen a historic turnaround
now people are talking about repealing the dent act .
i 'm told mr. wayne couldn 't be here tonight . i 'm sure he 's with us in spirit .
no one has . not in years .
a thug who showed his true nature
dent . i 'll let him tell you himself .
the truth ?
the east drawing room .
i 'm sorry , miss tate . i tried , but he won 't see you .
look , you wouldn 't beat up a woman any more than i would beat up a cripple .
can i have a ride ?
let 's go .
she 's very persistent .
and this is your idea of , uh , sounding the alarm , is it ?
she ?
i wasn 't .
sir . congressman gilly 's wife has been calling in .
that 's a job for the police ?
pretty soon we 'll be chasing down , uh , overdue library books .
what 's your name , son ?
you have something you want to ask me ?
the last confirmed sighting of the batman .
breaks dent 's neck and then just vanishes ?
don 't you want to know who he was ?
master wayne ?
trying to find out more about our jewel thief . i ran her prints .
she may be , but we have a trace on the necklace .
with police data on high-end b-and-e 's , and , um ..
the databases are full of close-calls , tips from fences .
we should send the police before she fences the pearls
if it brought you back to the world .
and that 's the problem .
you never went to find a life . to find someone .
i know , and you lost them .
but you 're not living , you 're just waiting , hoping for things to go bad again .
before all this , before batman ?
seven years i waited , hoping that you wouldn 't come back .
maybe a couple of kids .
but we 'd both know that you 'd made it .
i never wanted you to come back to gotham .
and i wanted something more for you than that .
more when it gets colder .
we pulled him from the basin , but other than that we didn 't touch him .

you have a practiced apathy , mr. wayne .
and isn 't so wounded when it fails
thank you .
why didn 't you call the police ?
that 's a brazen costume for a cat burglar .
bruce wayne , eccentric billionaire .
his wife 's in ibiza .

and how would he do that ?
i am the league of shadows .
you fight like a younger man .

so even when the body was gone ,
the pressure ...
it 's more than a man can bear .

to live in this extraordinary place

jeez ! how could a dress be this big ?
i have to get something out of my bag .
i can 't find it . here , take this .
a hundred dollars in change .

i wish i had a friend like that .
what we need is for you to let us be who we are .
goodbye , gaby .

get them to stop it , or at least put some other girl up there .
and they 'll agree not to put them up ,
i talked them down from $ 12,000 .
i mean , it puts us right back where we were
and what 's mike gonna say when he notices
maybe i should just let them put up the billboards .
you know , there is another way .
how dare you exploit a traumatic childhood memory .
oh , look . he followed you home .
about the same as when he finds out
why don 't we ask him who he wants to be with ?
put him on the spot like that .
is that a hot flash or you just losing your nerve ?
everything okay here ?
can we ask you something ?
forest green or brown
we usually just take nancy around
pardon me , may i get past ?
i don 't know what to do .
you know , my cat can 't get this open either .
rich , funny , and in a suit at 9 : 00 a.m. ?
you know , my cat , dickens , loves your cat .
dickens , after the author , max .
the guy who wrote muppets christmas carol .
so i let her in . i hope that 's okay .
i hope your girlfriend didn 't mind .
and i better get going .
max , give the man his case .
she doesn 't want to get out of cushy this thing .
well , here 's my card , just give me a call
a card , a meeting , a suit , a joke ?
well , thank you , owen charles boyd ,
she 's joking , she 's just not as funny as you .

we 're getting close , look , i 'm holding his shoe .
survivor 's guilt ?
it 's not about my platoon .
i 'm asking you to claim them .
it 's about the fact that i tried

slow , slow . okay
uh , not so fast , dr grey
that mr. gates will also need a nerve repair .
before .
because you 'll have to explore the wound for bone fragments ,
maybe because he was hit by a car .
if he leaves and hurts himself , it 's on you .
but if someone in that waiting room dies , that 's on you .
what
i couldn 't be happier for the both of you .
dresses
so go , try on dresses
i don 't . how does he even know were engaged ?
he isn 't the one that ordered the dress .

can you please get me some more ?
the doctor said if we can find a way to get her there
hey , baby . guess what ?
you 're gonna love it there .
and the water .
why don 't you trade places with me ?
all i need is plane fare . then we 'll be on our way .
i 'm okay .
i had to get the scrubs with the elastic waistband .
i won 't . and you can 't make me
the chief will be my best man .
i may be irresponsible and untrustworthy out there
which is what you should 've done when i asked you to stay away from lexie
oh , hell
you chosen your specialty yet ?
it 's trauma
now i recognize that , uh , my daughter 's a senior resident
uh , i appreciate the offer , sir ,
you don 't have children , do you ?
no , you don 't , no .
i knew i wasn 't no good for her
it 's unforgivable .
i feel shameful about that .
how is that a start ?
you have to know what it is
he really damaged his facial nerves ,
but he 'll be fine .
oh , my god . thank you . thank you both so much .
i think the important thing is that , you know ,
we had a fight and you stormed out .
are you okay ?
okay , mr. hangover .
you 're kind of freaking me out a little bit , sophie .
can you ?
time , you know .
well , what else can we do ?
well , i mean , there 's the ...
i know you only had a little bit of it
well ..
all right . that 's not what i 'm talking about .
i imagined like horseback riding
what if this is something that i want to do ?
i want to help our relationship .
how long have you been here , by the way ?
no , i mean , in the guest house .
oh . someone 's in detective mode .
that 's okay . i don 't mind .
i think i have a pretty good sense of it .
it is . would you like to go on a walk with me ?
it 's your vacation , too .
i 'll see you in a little bit , sophie .
whoa
i think when you go in there
oh , no , no , sweetie .
what if they disappear or something , you know ?
i 'm just saying what 's the harm in letting
give me your hand .
you were spying on me .
over 20 .
yeah , but you know , we didn 't agree
are you serious ?
i was rocking your body in there .
i 'm sorry . i can see how
it 's a little confusing . sorry .
okay .
how was it in general though ?
it 's so strange . it 's really odd .
you were funny and charming , and you just kept telling me
he is you.he 's just a little ...
a little what
you 're not saying that like it 's like ..
no , no , no , no , no .
not at all . that 's the crazy thing
no . no , not really .
you know what , the hair .
the hair ?
it 's like , like kind of
don 't worry about it .
oh , and you know what , you don 't wear glasses .
i would have .. so what do you think it was ?
yeah , and to me that 's a logical conclusion .
can i help you with something ?
we all go home tomorrow ,
yeah , that 's right . they do .
all right
you can drive yourself nuts trying to derive meaning
it is , isn 't it ?
now we all know how electricity works ,
does he ruin it by questioning how or why ?
don 't worry about it . i got it
should we finish it
has ethan .. i mean your ethan
like he knew when i was going to go in the house
and you want to know if we shared our experiences also .
i can see that .
i knew you had the aces .
almost too good .
he clearly just let you win .
come on , guys .
the reason he 's not being fun is because he 's not even playing
all right . fine . i 'll play .
come on .
okay . all right . that 's the spirit .
let 's go .
how many cards do you want ?
ethan , just calm down .
t don 't want to take all the credit here
do you want to tell her or should t ?
i think it 's important that sophie knows what 's going on .
would everybody just tell me what we 're talking about ?
it 's nothing
he didn 't go to the grocery store .
i can 't fucking pretend to be you .. i am me .
just shut up ! sophie , please .
i didn 't want to make like a thing here .
if you want to like take the guest house , you 'd be welcome .
no , i want you to leave .
hey . it 's ethan .
maybe next session you can send us
alright , so we have to hit the keys at the exact same time .
on three , okay ?
you want to get changed ?
we 're probably the same size .
do you have anything like that ?
come on , girls . let 's go .
great . thanks so much .
um , well , my toothpaste and toothbrush is over there .
sure , i 'll get you something
hey . did you find some clothes for her ?
hey , sophie , sit anywhere you like .
where is lighting that will make me look most attractive ?
i am meeting man for first time that i met online .
well unless you 've been cruising singles
no , this will never happen .
well , what is your type ?
i love being blown like that .

show her some respect .
i am so mad i cannot see straight .
here , i will pay for it .
then i 'm out .
booyah !
i need penicillin .
i 'm not like you .
menachem goldman .
either that or we 're in zz top-ville .
hey , i got nothing but respect .
i love the jewish people .
so your love was contingent on pills ?
actually , the kleins and i were very close .
in fact , they called me their honorary jew .
well , you 're no rivka shemshelewitz .
i did three times and no return .
all those years i thought we were family .
i don 't know , ignoring your needs
caroline channing , caroline channing .
let me do the talking .
these are my people .
sorry , i didn 't know it was an orthodox neighborhood .
max ?
coat on or off ? make up your mind .
it 's been a few years , but trust me ,
how else do you think i landed
i 'm sorry .
i was very close to my neighbors , the kleins .
stop now .
we 'll just get our money and go .
what are we , barbarians ?
but , out here in the kitchen , away from the men .
three of my favorite things to do .
hadassa , hand me a spoon .
someone 's been on the internet .
ooh , there he is .
the bar mitzvah boy who , today , becomes a man .
say hello to the girls who made the cupcakes , boys .
damn , sweetness , your lips are moving
oh , boys , there you are , come on .
nice to meet you .
that 's the first time i ever saw anyone
and they 're back .
that 's right .
preach !
how much of my mitzvah money
yo , don 't get all jealous , vanilla cone .
how would you like it if i told your mother
damn , son !
don 't say anything to her .
max , she should know .
just keep it to yourself for five minutes and we 're gone .
ma , this is max who made the kosher cupcakes .
max , what are you talking about ?
yes , well , maybe my rabbi didn 't have such high standards .
so close .
yes , you told me about tradition and family .
and she was nice enough to put it on my head
i like a party as much as the next man ,
oh , sheldon , we don 't need a meeting every three months .
lucky for you it 's tomorrow .
well , you have to go .
this meeting is a waste of time .
you realize one of them has sugar on the raisins .
and yet you get to weigh in .
well , we 'll just see about that .
he says he 's not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow .
you have fun . i will not be attending .
meeting .
which means i 'm gonna have to google " how to play catch . "
you know how guys are .
i mean , look at me .
don 't get too fond of this character . "
yeah , but i won 't say who it is .
wait , what is going on ?
as long as i don 't have to watch with him .
i 'll go over here .
from amy .
because you were defending sheldon like you always do .
oh , yes , you do . you know you have a weird
that 's different .
um , guys ?
your infections , you mean .
and you didn 't even do that right .
i can afford any hospital in the world ,
i 've been here for three weeks .
discharge her , please . i 'll pay you .
now get me outta here before i sue your balls off .
give me a number .
after we inform mr. beckert 's family ,
oh , it doesn 't matter . i 'm gonna shut it down , pending the autopsy .
i thought dr.bailey said torres can 't be moved yet .
i think it 'll do the both of them good .
why do you even ask me these things , huh ?
i need your help with something .
it was never opened , so it needs to go back into the lot .
i heard about your patient . i 'm sorry .
have a good night .
henry , will you open the door ?
my super cute tee !
right up there with the bong with a chin strap
they are making a fortune on us .
this is our attorney . mr ....
and he is holding our cease and desist
is that a bad thing ?
and he 's real good .
how ? i 'm your roommate .
hello , girls , you all look very nice .
you are ! oh ! you got it .
" merry christmas . what are you getting this year ? "
morning , princess .
yes , you do .
i have been out in the forest ,
you would starve and die if it weren 't for me .
oh , my partridge-in-a-pear-tree underwear needs washing .
come on , snowy . i 'll race you .
sorry , guys !
can i ask you a few questions ?
guacamole ? what is it made from ?
can i have $ 150 a day , please ?
alex doesn 't cook .
he analyzed the breakfast you gave him
he 's a great kid , isn 't he ?
sometimes , i feel like a hyped-up
your female energy .
you said , you , you said , " go ! take some time . "
everybody at home is blaming me , yelling at me ,
all that matters is what 's happening to you .
all i have ever done is try to help you .
exactly ! bingo ! partridge in a pear tree !
then i guess , that 's all there is to say .
i 'm going to the north pole
that 's amazing ! oh , alex would love that so much .
i think she just feels obligated .
i 'm gonna stay at home , put a frozen pizza in the oven
i 'm glad you enjoyed it .
probably never .
well , i do have somewhere i need to be for christmas .
because you 're nice . i mean , officially .
it was jolly .
oh , well , look at you .
now that is very mature .
how did you get here ?
polly ! look who it is .
how many people wear gingerbread deodorant ?
" noelle , i know i was angry ,
which still makes it my best christmas in a long time .
wait , so you believe what i told you ?
but to get out of here , stop talking about the north pole ,
see ?
these things happen .
the question is , what really makes a santa ?
noelle , can you inspire us ?
i used to think christmas was the best day of the year .
it should say there , in the file .
a long time .
when did you start ?
i was a drunk
how do you feel about the girl ?
which was ? why ?
we face these decisions every day , and we vote up or down .
to determine whether you are fit to remain in the field .
me taking care of the girl , me taking care of the police
blackleg miner .
you and another team , alternating shifts . three days each .
whatever it takes .
do the job , emerson .
'll inform the authorities
sure . we 're coordinating troop movements in afghanistan .
when i didn 't get off the train right away ,
what i already knew . yeah , i got it .
i was trying to make a joke about
they 're gonna use it again .
they could have had david and meredith 's code but not ours .
take a deep breath .
" cardiff , aberdeen , glasgow , belfast , oxford , slough . "
the station 's been compromised .
omne moment .
okay .
well , you have a piece of truck in your leg .
grit your teeth .
but it 's gonna be okay , right ?
emerson , lie to a girl , will you ?
emerson !
i thought you left me .
little while . not long
so , what ? what ? they wanted to stop the broadcasts ?
sit back down
we 're fine . ve were ambushed calm down .
stop walking around on your leg .
we 're clear
oh , my god , it 's david .
they must have thought he was dead . bled out .
if i wanted to cripple the system in one fell swoop ,
i mean , what the hell do they want with us ?
grab that . let 's go .
bodies . dead people . seeing them .
there 's stuff on here , but it 's password protected .
i don 't know . i 'm trying
good . just keep working
yeah , what do you wanna talk about ?
not really my strong suit , katherine .
oh , that was just a lucky guess .
you fit a profile .
civilian broadcasters have a certain , you know , personality trait
indifferent and emotionally detached from reality .
willing to sit silently in one place for hours at a time
no , i had a stable childhood
striking lack of empathy or compassion for other people .
you know , i , um , didn 't always do this .
i was on the other end of the numbers .
recruited me straight out of college .
told me i 'd do special things , important things .
himm ..
they know how to use it . they 're good at it .
where are you going ?
i 'm stuck here with you . yeah .
what have you got outside of this ? bo you have a life ?
what do you mean " how does it matter "
mmm-hmm ... this is all you 've got .
you 're on the other side of the fucking numbers .
you think you 're not a part of this , huh ?
what 's wrong with you ? what are you doing here ?
no , you can live a long time like this .
can you take the bullet out ?
here .
wait .
we 'll put the billiard room through there , eh ?
best bloody billiard players in the world , australians .
well , ask anyone .
yeah , it 's boris . it 's a farm building .
solid as bloody gibraltar .
your point being ?
now they 're being mined from underneath .
if he 's not , then he should be back on duty .
if you want my opinion , neither should you .
wouldn 't like to think we were over here
hides it well .
seems a shame to waste this .
oh , rather !
it 's alright , tiffin . it 's alright , son .
oliver , is that you ?
colin , gordon , round the back .
hey , hey , wait . that 's not fair !
ah . well , you 're too late , i 'm afraid . he 's joined up .
of course .
you know , we thought the headhunters might have got you .
tell you something , though , mrs waddell ,
so , when i arrived i loosened the girth .
are you sure you 're not injured ?
thank you for the tea , mrs waddell .
oliver .
anything ?
it 's just making it darker .
not enough oxygen for it to burn .
could be worse .
well , they could send us to hill 60 .
messines ridge , just across the border , near wipers ' .
still don 't know what i heard , but .
maybe i never heard no germans .
don 't make no difference .
oh , bloody generous of ' em .
probably not a good idea , corp .
we was ready to give up on you , pull through .
well , we was .
finish your letter , walt , or get some more shut-eye .
and that 's why we kept digging .
and how much explosive charge would you need to demolish that building ?
how much would you need to do the job properly ?
do we have that in the stores or do we have to requisition it ?
there 's a listening post at 105 drive .
if we drove north from there ,
let 's have it done before sun-up , 0400 .
i 'll have the artillery give you one hour .
he couldn 't get out of here fast enough .
it 'll mean going over the bags ...
i nearly forgot-a present from fritz .
you 'll be right , lads .
too early for the grey hen , sir ?
come on , son .
decent fit .
when we get back ,
your boy 's gonna make a great prop forward .
you join up together ?
gets the young fella all excited with his stories of adventure
elsa 's nearly had bloody kittens , hasn 't she , walt ?
... i 'd like to ask you something .
and .
it goes so deep under german lines ,
yeah , the blue clay 's further down .
keeping the water out was their main problem .
now it 's ours .
right below german lines .
the blue clay of flanders .
major north , 3rd canadian tunnellers .
he can 't get at us . oh no no no .
i 've never seen anything like this before .
500 feet down there is a caterpillar mine .
there 's 21 of them .
you know , when this thing blows
all we have to do is keep the bloody thing dry
he thinks we 're digging wells .
water seeps down , pools above the clay .
we have 60 blokes manning the pumps night and day
where did they get this lot ?
yes , when it came to a crisis ,
even if bree herself would have preferred to be a passenger .
what am i supposed to do ?
well , apparently , jane doesn 't play by the same rules .
can you believe this guy ?
yeah . that 's a healthy attitude .
bows of fruit .
as a matter of fact , i did .
okay , again , as a former teacher ,
her technique is atrocious .
and i love it .
i think we already have .
hey , hey , hey , enough with the screaming !
what are we having ? spaghetti and meat-shapes ?
is daddy eating with us ?
celia ! use a fork , not the doll .
can we rent it again
i know , but we always plan our vacations in the fall .
you can 't promise that , carlos .
nothing 's happened . relax .
i 'm just saying , a cop could show up at the door any day
sure , we do . we named a guardian when we did our will .
we were really a family then .
of course . oh , of course . it 's just ..
you should go wait out on the porch .
legitimate whining .
you guys have a problem with ?
you 've got two , and they 're both ...
what :
i was gonna say " spirited . "
they 've changed . they 're all grown up now .
so well-behaved .
you know what ? that 's a great idea .
okay .
did you say anything to her about not liking jane ?
okay .
hey , don 't blame me .
you made your bed ... with someone else .
bree ?
i wanted to celebrate your first day of construction
there was a little problem .
not yet .
um , they dug it up halloween night ,
" cause i keep hoping i 'll find a way out of this .
they shut it down . i lose a lot of time ,
it must be so tempting to just ..
i 'm sure you 've considered re-burying it
y-yeah , yeah . of course i have .
and i ...
this is why i like her in bed .
so as you can see , susan , i 'm a little busy ,
i am totally adrift in that class .
would it help if i told you what your grade is ?
i don 't get it . what were you thinking ?
sorry .
well , he 's a delight .
does this have something to do with , uh ..
yes .
well , it 's pretty hard to build a case without a body .
why would you do that for me ?
i might need something from you .
i thought we were going to the mall .
you know why he 's sitting over there ?
then he shouldn 't have left us for jane .
he didn 't leave us . he left me .
there 's no bad guys here .
and i know he would love to play catch with his daughter .
you , uh , want something to drink ?
this isn 't a social visit . i need to ask you something ,
oh , and my self-esteem could really use
the guy is sending a private plane for me .
that 's how good i am in bed .
what is all of the excitement ?
we 're going to the grammys .
do you think you 'll meet 2 chainz ?
no , he can 't be your boi , he 's my boi .
this reminds me so much of the plane we used to have .
max , this was my plane .
wait , if this was my plane ...
there 'd be something i hid down here for an emergency .
yep . my chanel lip gloss .
just in case something went wrong .
you know they don 't care what you look like
i have no idea .
i should tell you i took $ 10 out of the cupcake fund
okay , everybody . we got a bit of a situation .
kate . " everyone 's assembling at yankee stadium .
" i don 't know what to do . "
oh , i just ignored her .
i didn 't even try .
that 's the last voicemail i have from her .
okay , yeah , i 'm just gonna start at 1700 .
i just hope my mom 's okay .
su , you can 't just think about ... yeah , right .
you 're good , are you okay ?
i hid the bullets too , in a separate place .
yeah .
okay . yeah , like passports and birth certificates .
we have spaghetti squash , micro greens ,
macha 's owls might even come here
saoirse , it 's just one of mum 's stories .
the child .
this is the last straw now .
now look , you 've caught a cold .
wha ....
she 's not safe in this awful place .
dad , where did she get this ?
i can 't lose her , too , bronach .
i 'm not going . you can 't make me .
so , you 'd better stop this nonsense
would you say that could be her ?
what do you think you 're doing ?
you 're going to stay at granny 's .
her real coat .
do you hear that , lads ? we are saved
good thinking , saoirse .
thanks .
there 'd better not be any snot on it .
maybe we can take a short cut .
careful , lad .
whoa , each hair holds a story ?
that 's right .
his heart was broken into pieces
what 's wrong
mlacha has her no w .
she 'll be turned to stone soon , no doubt
and we 'll all share in her fate
not the way i do .
you 're so full of emotions .
nasty , terrible things .
you worry so much
my son lost someone , too , a long time ago .
now , if someone said that they could take that pain away ,
that 's all i do , ben .
it doesn 't hurt . it will never hurt again .
there is no way out .
come here , cu . keep the old witch quiet , will you ?
it 's not your fault , it never was .
i 'm sorry .
iuhave been so lost for so long
i couldn 't bear to see my son suffering so much .

what the hell happened to my career , man ?
how 's the room ? the room ? who cares about the room , man ?
he 's still a fan , man , but he thinks you 're a little old for the way they 're going .
you know what we need is that game changer
you have to trust and be patient .

but now you gon ' tell me a real story .
ex-cop .
got dismissed from the force about a year and a half ago .
got me on a heavy domestic .
i did a year .
can 't see my kids no more .
and that 's all because of the story you gon ' tell me right now .
yeah ?
so , i gave her a ride home from work , right ?
we talked , hung out , had a few drinks .
she starts telling me about her scumbag of a husband .
i just listened , man .
i wanted to hold her , so i did .

tell me he 's not lying somewhere in a ditch dead .
so why didn 't he answer his pager or his cell phone ?
and why doesn 't anybody in this hospital
dementia . the guy was useless .
it 's possible .
and if he fell and hit his head ,
he could have a subarachnoid hemorrhage .
i 'm not here to get my job back .
dr. singer ..
ooh , what 's happening ? what 's happening ?
it 'll give you the most direct approach .
i-i just need to talk to the chief about something .
don 't know how long she 's staying , if she 's staying .
that 's all i know .
and by the time you realized what time it was
chief .
the chief has emergency surgery .
the new attending doesn 't even know how to put in
did you or did you not ask this man
you finish each other 's sentences .
you 're more married to that man than i am .
excuse me ?
you look out for each other . you take care of each other .
excuse me ?
he 's my work-husband ,
all right . talk me through the procedure .
no , that was actually a teaching moment .
dr. avery , what can we infer from this ?
yes , in the left ventricular wall .
already there .
it does that on its own .
i guess i 'm the one who learned something today .
chief .
and that a man in your position has certain ...
and that , uh , when a man
are you hitting on me ?
and i was not hitting on you .
dr. percy is almost done
that makes two of us .
so what 's going on with you and karev ?
how is that any of your business ?
it 's all anybody talks about around here .
i mean , he knows how important this is to me .
and he brings me , like , this desert storm barbie
have you even talked to izzie yet ?
you know what ? no one 's allowed to talk about izzie while i eat .
what :
oh , yeah ? well , take a look around .
it 's a 45-minute surgery .
a febrile seizure at 3 months .
and did he scream a lot when you brought him home from the hospital ?
and has his asthma gotten better or worse as he 's gotten older ?
okay . thanks .
can 't we just go to big boy ?
well , the barbecue burger is like the big boy .
because you 're not at big boy !

how can she take your order
you stick electrodes in a rat 's brain , give him an orgasm button ,
well , the only difference between us and the rat
yeah , well , i 'm just glad to be a part of it .
in fact , we 're going to save that crazy lady 's life
told you i saw a lion .
is this about cristina again ?
i wish i could take it back .
oh , quit it . stop thinking about the hot ortho nurse .
i-i could see it in those eyes .
what happened then ?
i shoved my arm right into his mouth .
who the hell feeds himself to a lion ?
what do we got ?
yeah , that 's what you expect when you hear " lion . "
she never bothered to mention she had a pet lion ?
so i dissect out and remove the animal cadaver hearts .
correct . and why do we do that ?
like stripping a house down to its frame only .
we are wiping them clean ,
when we inject them with stem cells ...
let 's grow ourselves some new hearts .
but you 're still a student ,
are you gonna tell mark to move in with julia ?
we don 't talk about stuff like this .
you 're not using the oil .
we 're only in town till tomorrow .
mr. carroll , you 're experiencing a heart attack .
can you tell me what you were doing
and it was like a piano fell
you weren 't running or anything else
we saw a lion .
don 't you think , that thing with colleen ?
yeah , she gets like that .
she gets like that , like you know how she gets ,
what ? it 's not ... what ? i 'm just asking .

okay , you know what ? we 're not doing this .
karev . i know about karev .
what , five ? ten ? a hundred ?
no , no , no , no , no . you can 't just go .
" you 're ignoring me . you 're a total ... "
if you need to step away , just say so .
yes , we are , doctor .
she needs to figure out how to take care of herself
there is no time like the present to embrace it .
all right . removing the aortic cross-clamp now .
damn it . the ventricle 's ruptured .
they should .
gotta be why she didn 't tell me that kirby was a lion .
we met on a dating site .
so adventurous ,
son , you are a hero .
so ... i saved her ?
really ?
when your surgery was finished ..
i thought that she had fallen asleep ,
it 's just a sound effect .
they are watching to make sure
learn to have some fun in your life . jeez .
what is that ?
everything is safe . everything is careful .
and we provided them with a box seat
but every year , they demand more .
more interesting subjects .
last year , they had college athletes ..

we were having a fight when he ...
honey , the doctors here are great .

so don 't mess this up .
my marriage is a bit strained .
no one 's been convicted yet , mrs. solis . this is just a grand jury hearing .
oh . right .
anyways , he was placed under house arrest
well , i didn 't exactly ease his mind .
before carlos ' house arrest , he was always working and he was never with me .
he would realize he loved me .
is there a point to this ?
she did some terrible , crazy , selfish stuff .
if 's complicated .
and just like that , my husband began sharing my secrets .
secrets i had died to protect .
hello .
nice to meet you . irina .
oh , she 's more than a friend , mom . we 're in love .
she wants nothing to do with your son .
hey , this is ana . leave a message .

irina really loved the ring , mom . that 's why she wanted
you sure ? nana 's ring is worth a lot more
but i want your mother to know
he was single , so was she .
when she found out she was pregnant , she called him .
he offered to support her financially ,
just tell her i can 't come .
she 's 93 .
no , hang on . i followed all the protocols
i checked the tire pressure on the car .
fyi , it 's none .
you use it to get your way .
the fact that the right way is also my way

that 's my job .
and i don 't need a partner .
coincidentally , where i found you .
i really appreciate all the shit you 've done for me , you know ,
see , partnership leads to ambition .
mutiny .
it 's bad news .

good . now , do you have a pen ?
well , get a pen .
good . now , in the top right-hand drawer
okay .
right ? all the numbers , the sign-offs , the road closures
well , the blow-heater was taken by the fucking hungarians .
donal , you do know which drawer that i mean , right ?
i looked at my diary and i checked .
the block was in . i was happy with it .
once !
will you ? right . now , ivan ... ivan , listen to me .
because i 've got six calls here that i 'm looking at
so , as far as i 'm concerned , until the sun comes up ,
you have a call waiting .
so it is cider that you 're drinking ?
eat something .
2-1 to us . two goals in three minutes .
is your mother there ?
she 's been in there ages .
um , do you want me to call her ?
go on , you enjoy the game .
i am , eddie , i 'm going mad inside .
but i 'm driving and i 'm , uh
bethan , it 's me .
i know they 're operating on you right now , but i just wanted to say good luck .
so what ?
you have to be solid
" look and fucking learn . "
constructed out of two bottles of wine and somebody feeling lonely .
hey , dad .
we won . ah , what was the score ?
i 'll , um .. i 'll explain when i 'm not driving .
yes , i 'll explain when i 'm not driving
i 've only just explained it to myself
where else would i go ?
he 's been crying .
sean , you tell eddie that it 's okay ,
the baby will be born .
in the morning she will be okay .
and when the baby is born ,
because .. because i straightened the name out .
you know what , you old bastard ? you know what ? i know i
katrina , please , listen .
but , look , i ... i don 't want you coming here
i mean , right at the top where you like to look out
i won 't have to deal with your footprints
general , go tell my father hercules is here .
it 's meant to be . it took five years and a thousand men to build her temple .
everyone knows the legend , how hera seeks to destroy hercules .
stay away from him . men who deal in violence attract violence .
lord cotys will see you now .
once or twice .
look . magnificent , aren 't they ?
the hydra 's heads , your majesty .
no wonder men thought they were monsters .
let the people have their hero .
amphiaraus ?
it is said you have glimpsed your own death ,
only what the gods see fit to reveal .
when you fight , the wall is your armor .
remember these words ,
halt !
alt !
leave the chariots . we 'll go down on foot .
i hate being right all the time .
this head is rotting .
we 're here to help them . why are they attacking ?
turn comrades against each other .
but just to avoid future misunderstandings ,
another mistake , i 'll end you myself .
i 'm sorry . i never knew my father .
and someday , he will make a fine king .
do they live in athens ? thank you for your care .
how could you do such a terrible thing ? by law , i should execute you ,
the great hercules .
my family was gone . everyone was gone .
he became my brother-in-arms .
it can cloud their minds . we call it the blood rage .
he made me vow to keep the world away from him .
and that , my lady , is the truth .
well , much as birds take flight , so , too , are these shields lighter than air .
try on the helmet of hercules .
forged after hercules ' very own helmet , when he defeated the demon geryon .
centaurs .
he saw shadows in the night .
will fall . you want to stop rhesus ?
it 'll slow down our chariots . a gamble .
the scouts have returned . rhesus has made his camp in mount asticus ,
the gods have been annoyingly silent on that matter .
when will you die ?
oh , cheer up , hercules .
i 'm ready for what 's next .
don 't do anything foolish .
i saw pity in your eyes for rhesus . why ?
you lie very well . clearly , your father 's daughter .
if i disobeyed cotys or resisted in any way , arius would be executed .
my husband was king . and cotys poisoned him to take his place .
i had dreams of ruling this kingdom .
my thousands will train more thousands , and they even more .
what you began here can never be stopped .
spare me the moral outrage .
getting us all killed , bad idea .
you will be paid in full . bring them the gold .
take mine , too .
there will be no more innocent blood on my hands .
oh , i see . and who 's gonna be paying us for this suicidal endeavor ?
he paid ts to save thrace . let 's not disappoint him .
lay down your arms ! or your nephew dies first .
confused , hercules ?
king eurystheus and i will now rule all of greece .
speak a little louder , hercules .
before they saw you as their king ?
precisely ! your sin , hercules , was that you had no ambition !
but a man who wants nothing has no price !
i had to ruin your name .
my children !
all of you ! starting with my faithless daughter !
so you 've been seeing other girls ?
does that mean slutty trolls ?
i brought you some iced tea .
it 's passion fruit , new on the menu .
oh , sorry .
that 's it ! prepare for marshmallow death !
so anyway ...
yeah . i think i 'm gonna take her to miniature golf .
i love them . they 're disgusting .
still , it was really thoughtful of randy .
yeah , someone really buried the lead
feels like 35 .
oh , my god . i just got an e-mail .
betty white 's coming here ?
amy schumer 's sister 's best friend .
she wants to meet me to see if she digs my vibe .
they wouldn 't let me bring it on the plane .
i don 't want jennifer lawrence to think
we will have lots in common .
hey , everybody .
yeah , and that 's not on my list .
i gotta go to miami .
my client 's johnny depp .
this is her assistant tiesha . please hold .
oh , yeah , there it is .
oh , man .
she married eddie murphy .
oh , i can watch bruno .
at your beautiful house in the hills
or you can get some reception outside .
come here , big boy .
that call works on me too , fyi .
caroline , where 's the best reception ?
oh , is that a snake ?
i 'm gonna call the diner .
are you rich , famous , and driving a prius yet ?
i am looking down on all of la .
ask max if she talked to sophie .
max , you 've been with him four days .
i 'm really sorry , max . we 'll find him .
i 'll put it down my pants .
you gotta focus
oh , don 't talk to me about boundaries .
who-who-who-who ?
halfway through the starter , i tell him about kristin .
that 's her .
shit . okay , give me a minute .
i try logging in every day . it gives you three wrong guesses ,
this week i 'm into places we went on holiday .
come on , lads .
yeah . hood 's off , he 's in the back .
this is david gilkes , negotiator .
for like a second when he pulled the gun .
no , just angry .
we know who the hostage is . he 's from smithereen .
yeah . they contacted the met
shit .
this ... this is a whole plan he 's had going on here .
i find it hard to believe he 's never raised red flags before .
listen , there 's a whole load of police here
you know how they get .
oh , leave me alone .
harris , if we need you , you got a clear shot ?
can you shut up , please ?
chris , i know you 're pretty stressed at the moment .
my name is david ...
well , some people call me that , but really i 'm just a ..
you 'll pretend to be my friend
is that right , david ?
i don 't get that feeling .
well , maybe that 's part of the problem .
they 've got a news van as well .
everyone back behind cover , now .
you are listening in , so listen to this .
if you don 't phone back
that 's final . okay ? it 's final .
i 'm sorry .
bill , i 'm here .
funny .
why me ?
morning , sweeney .
got a friend with me here today .
well , you can have a go . i mean , other people have had a go .
have you ? you got big fucking nuts ? let 's have a look at them .
tell me something , lewis .
the job .
so what ?
i work on the front line , son .
sorry , it 's your tits .
what you saying ? i gotta lose a bit of weight ?
i suppose i could , erm , lose a couple of kilos for you .
what you looking at ?
i don 't understand . why would someone tell you where our man is ,
what can i say ? i just come about it from a different angle than you , that 's all .
anyway , my new mate here .
just bring me up .
he reckons our boy allen 's got a little bolt-hole in the countryside .
report to me anything you see . do not come off of channel 6 .
he 's a very capable and dangerous man .
where the fuck are you ?
do you think he 's even in there ?
he 's really got under your skin , hasn 't he , this one ?
not while i 'm sweeney .
what would be the best way of asking lewis out on a date ?
yeah , nancy .
i wouldn 't bother if i was you , ellis .
i was at a barbecue .
i wonder how it would really feel to be shot in the head . point blank .
bang !
gone . a full stop on an ordinary life .
bollocks .
you think i carry fucking pork chops around with me for the fun of it ?
you seem like a smart man , francis . you shouldn 't underestimate me .
what you got ?
he re-entered the night wextru saw him with a suitcase .
anyone could have carried his passport .
and you know we only have him in custody for 24 hours .
get it quickly , regan .
i 'm sick of sneaking about in the shadows .
what ? here in a holiday inn ? it 's not that easy .
makin trebolt , you slag .
he 's a serb , ex-paramilitary .
got an eye for killing witnesses .
what she saw and what she heard we still don 't know ,
mate , you look like shit . you should go home and get some sleep .
look , we all thought it was allen .
you 're no good to us like this .
not with megan the way she is . you know i can 't .
yeah .
you 'd still be a two-bob thief on the estate sticking brown up your ...
but i 'm the one had to walk through it .
i lost a valuable fucking member of my team today .
why didn 't you protect her , jack ?
ruck !
i couldn 't move . i couldn 't help her .
i can 't live like this . i just need your help . i 'm on the fucking ropes here .
i told you in the cells .
wrong fucking answer .
he paid me .. he paid ... . allen paid me !
keep your hands behind your head !
lower your weapons , boys .
gotta say i 'm disappointed it was you , carter .
there 's your man .
i told you , i know where trebolt 's at , i know where he 's going .
i just got you off the hook and it won 't happen again .
you can take all your intelligence down to the nci when they interview you .
you 're just gonna leave jack in prison ? locked up like a criminal ?
you worked out all the math .
i wrote a paper .
i wrote a paper on our idea .
our idea is really good .
you know , if no one 's thought of this , yet ,
uh , another one says , " the concept shows
i do , indeed , mr. box-thinking .
mr. can-you-believe-these-jack-asses ?
" the analogy between space-time
who wrote that ?
uh , don 't lower yourself to their level .
and failing that ,
there 's no upside to doing this .
what does it say ?
maybe space-time is like two clowns
you mess with the bull , you get the horns .
somebody else do it .
i think i might be turning into a killer gorilla .
i 'm starting to miss that .
what 's taking him so long ?
yeah , i do . no matter how he responds ,
i 've , uh , created some other user accounts
all she longed to ask was
i 'm so sick of people being mean on the internet .
interesting .
never noticed that about you .
so ... this is gonna be a thing .
um , while you 're here ,
no . looks , uh , normal . what are you doing here ?
yeah , i do . i 'm not here .
looks like you 're here to me , which is good ,
you 're getting suspended ?
it requires a full cast on the broken leg , connected to
and because your son is so young ,
as soon as an o.r. opens up ,
the losers in medical records aren 't answering .
floor seats .
i know it is done by many medical professionals in this hospital .
eli lloyd ... do not test me .
all the intensely exciting , toe-curling potential ...
dr. bailey .
just don 't take it with alcohol .
we 're missing our anniversary dinner
i 'm sorry . gia . i am . but it really hurts .
well , i-i brought lots of magazines and a good novel .
i know you have far more pressing patients .
look , stew-man . they opened the doors right for us .
this is gonna be fast . we 'll be in and out , man .
all right . will do .
i will .
wouldn 't miss it .
how did this guy get a knife in his head ?

yeah , no problem . take your time .
hey , stranger .

sorry to be rude . hi . hey .
william , henry . henry . william .
something like that .
uh , but i 'll be back soon .
all right , grey , what do you got ?
no cardiac risk factors , no angina .
these are his films ,
you got cardiac enzymes ?
hey , kepner .
even if i were good at forging signatures , i wouldn 't do it .
you 're just gonna have to finish signing your charts on your own .
get him in for p.a. and lateral films ,
that 's what boarding schools are for .
trauma 2 .
you cannot drink beer in here .
oliver , did you see dr. altman ?
we caught the stroke early. which is very good .
you should cancel the trip .
looks like the blade landed in the maxillary sinus .
excuse me .
no , no problem . um , really .
although he 's probably sick of me by now .
you didn 't mention he used to play pro ball .
it 's not a big deal , really .
look , i don 't mean to hold you guys up .
doesn 't look like it from this .
he should be out of surgery any minute .
one , two ...
so now can we get outta here ?
pupils are equal and reactive . he 's alert and awake .
he needs surgery . book an o.r ..
no time .
he needs surgery right now .
all right . here we go .
all right . let clear it .
come on . come on . come on .
and open him as soon as possible .
even then , if that aorta tears ,
i know . i know .
just pour the betadine straight on to the chest .
all right . plug me in .
he 's dic .
let 's push 3 of epi . set me up for another shock .
damn it .
there 's nothing . his aorta is in shreds .
you know , it 's not that i don 't want to share you .
oh . okay .
do you know how old i was when your parents died ?
twenty-two , younger than you , but i took you in .
it 's not your fault .
do you have any idea what i had to give up ?
and because you go above and beyond .
say it with me .
.. like no one else can .
fifth year is the hardest year of your residency .
in just a few months , you will ...
you 're o.b. now ?
she misses zola . her uterus hurts .
you are embarrassing me .
i 'm making life , you know ?
like what is the deal
well , if i give you all the answers ,
hi . how 's your day going ?
right .
no kissing in the hospital .
we don 't work together anymore .
it 's called a-a rash guard . you wear it at the pool .
clearly you 've never been to palm beach .
i can 't get through to this guy .
i really shouldn 't talk about it .
bailey 's not gonna find out about it ?
i 'm not telling her crap .
and i can 't pick up the short ribs .
why are you so gung-ho to do this ?
we could roast a chicken .
could we please shut up about dinner ?
oh , sorry .
what ? no .
so i 'm gonna secure the cage temporarily and close .
problem solved .
g. is healthy .
yes , but i think i 'm on to something , though .
i 'll tell you when i figure it out .
you just have to line up the arrows .
look , uh .
and i-i know i 'm the bad guy here , but ...
i want to be happy , you know ?
maybe a couple more months .
maybe they 're just not surviving because of other causes .
exactly . okay . bump me .
the device is working ,
it doesn 't matter .
and who do you think you are ?
dr. bailey , she was just doing
i mean , to put your hands on another clinical trial
read my research .
okay . i 've cleared out the tumor
it 's like a line of defense .
it grows on both sides of the brain
i have to defend every decision
i-i ...
you take crazy risks in the o.r .
safe ,
i get it . fifth year is competitive .
an orgasm is an orgasm .
don 't let fifth year get to you .
please .
aren 't these yum ?
are you sure ? ' cause i don 't think it drank itself .
look , i have no problem drinking .
but , " a , " not with my parents ,
so , i 'll go get you guys some more water ,
he seems like a real go-getter , huh ?
i wonder what he wants to do with his life .
i think that 's very common ,
yeah , you do .
hey , brian , you 're a young guy .
there it is again .
jay , you have to make this right with shorty .
i don 't know what you 're talking about , and neither do you .
you were gone .
i didn 't have a choice .
so what 's the new plan ?
yeah .
far as i can tell , we have two options .
he can go to hell .
you wouldn 't last a second in there with sammy .
then i guess we 'll just have to outsource .
you 're delta force ? like chuck norris ?
excuse me a second .
hey , once you get the hang of it ,
too bad what ?
no , no. you were saying ... ?
not through scofield .
i 'm not trying to get on your bad side either .
i believe you .
i keep my promises .
cashier 's check payable to cash. same thing .
keep your ears open , sugar .
hold it steady ! i am ! i am !
come on .
i never thought i 'd say this ,
the sooner he 's dead , the sooner we can get on the escape .
you 're in .
we got to call off the fight .
no , no , no ,
no , that 's it ! i can 't go against
this isn 't the best neighborhood .
just stick close .
you never d have come otherwise .
you know , uh ,
i think this is gonna work .
you know , i run charters , just like i said ..
then one day , that brunette , gretchen well , she asked me
so you two have history .
alex , i need a wedge .
look , i took ' em where they wanted me to take ' em .
what ?
this ?
and when you break out of here , you 're gonna do whatever
so why don 't we go back to work ? how 's that sound ?
and by doing so , erase every victory we fought for , including tonight'
we could use the technology ourselves , send someone back .
tell you what ?
no one can see the future , reese .
i cheat .
when i was a kid , it seemed like my mother knew everything .
not really .
once you go back , my knowledge ends .
skynet is a computer program , as long as it 's still being coded it 's contained .
it can 't be stopped .
yeah , we blow it , the hell , up .
what does it matter what i think
that 's the kind of man , your son was
alternate timelines are not complicated
there is a switch , and i will find it .
i will tell him .... just not yet , ok ?
hey , look i got some frame-grabs from the overpass .
it 's not a bomb
they came out of it .
those two were in 1984
o 'brien , have you been drinking ?
once they show up , it 's their game .
yeah . yeah , i pre-ordered genisys weeks ago .
no way i 'm standing in line for it .
what is it ? how did you hear it ?
genisys is an operating system ? what 's it do ?
tomorrow , the waiting is over
and i 'm here to tell you that
and now , before we wrap this up ,
i cannot wait to meet you all tomorrow .
let 's see how we 're doing
tn 30 years , you had one place to be
we can 't .
what if that 's what happens ?
you said you 'd follow me to the ends of the earth .
how 'd he find us ? i never told anyone about this place , only pops .
i wouldn 't remember
shoot first ?
what 's that supposed to do ?
the particles will not be able to scatter .
i hate it when he says that .
you got a job in construction ?
not yet .
that 's right . what do you think it is ?
poisoned ?
a man came in with the same symptoms .
little bit every day so it wasn 't obvious .
if it were up to me , i would give you that chance .
the parents ' council has all the power .
well , it would be a stant .
i won 't keep you .
what makes you think i lost it ?
no . i didn 't .
i give you a graceful way to spare my feelings ,
so you 're courting me ?
when will you stop playing hard to get ?
you see how much you enjoy smacking me down ?
come on . one dinner .
well , normally we test stuff
hey . what are you doing tonight ?
oh , thanks , renee , but i have a date .
that didn 't take long .
i could make something .
is it still 99 cents a minute ?
looks like we should just get this out there .
uh , i did some things that i am not proud of .
it feels like such an intrusion .
then i 'm just in the nick of time .
well , for me ,
is something wrong , bree ?
i see you 've done due diligence .
and that it hasn 't gone through ,
there is no comparison to what i did .
oh , women can be dangerous , too ,
what can i get you folks to start ?
come on , bree . calm down . have a drink .
someone 's slipping .
hmm ? what do you think i 'm doing ?
we should have discussed this .
you may call all the shots at work ,
for what it 's worth , your road trip sounds amazing .
i must have hauled her ass in 50 times .
before you knew it , she had a first class catering company ,
actually . i ...
i get it .
i know . way outta line .
home ?
you were right . found trace amounts of antifreeze ,
well , for one thing , you 'd get tired of tuna casserole .
it 'd be a nasty way to go .
what are you doing ?
turns out i borrowed a nylon bag of death .
for juanita . i wanna prove to her
so the kid is scared
i was no better .
we 're not kids anymore .
i guess it 's made us a little gun-shy ...
so what do we do ?
we forget about the crazy digging for dirt
all right .
well , it is lunchtime .
how 'd you know i like indian food ?
i don 't even know why i wanna work at that school again .
it 's positively awful .
ihear he went to the hospital ?
do the doctors know what caused it ?
oh , don 't be .
he 'll be fine .
i 'm sure it 's just what the doctor ordered .
oh , susan .
the grand canyon .
it took six million years to form .
looking at trees and a hole in the ground ?
yeah . yeah , if the grand canyon isn 't your scene ...
you 're bound to love our next stop ..
i don 't want that killer guy to chop off my head .
it would just mean i 'd have to clean it
it 's an actor in a movie .
it 's okay to be scared . it 's even fun sometimes .
what 's that ?
this is what i 'm talking about .
mama , i think it 's the killer .
mom , look !
gotcha !
oh , mom , you should 've seen your face .
plastic .
exactly .
so when you cast your vote tonight , kids ,
'cause hawaii has something for every scavo ,
it is the vacation of a lifetime .
i didn 't wanna do this .
really ? or did they just fail to find the evidence ?
what ?
you 're right . you 're right .
a gruesome helicopter crash .
you think you 're gonna be safer driving across country ?
god , you are a hypocrite .
ten years ago , christmas ,
well , guess what . i make the money ,
are you okay ? have i been pushing you too hard ?
whew . i just need to rest for a tiny little ..
i 'm not exactly sure .
i 'm sorry he 's not all ...
check out the jugs on her .
at my cousin 's funeral !
i am unfit to socialize with your classy gay boyfriend .
no . you are having dinner with bob ,
we owe him more than we can ever repay .
that was lee . he was the show queen .
oh . okay , well , i wanna get you tickets to something .
beauty pageants ?
ever think the reason lee broke up with you is you 're not gay ?
give me a beer and a college basketball game ,
hey , hey , hey ! you kiss boys with that mouth ?
you wanna go to a game this week ?
just three days , huh ?
i 'm sure it 'll be the end of my relationship with keith .
i just wanna make sure that ...

mrs. van de kamp ?
oh . um , i usually see dr. shapiro .
oh . well , there 's some salt in the wound .
and frankly , you 're in luck .

bob 's college nickname was " flipper . "
okay , this is crazy .
then he gets them really hammered .
well , i mean , not literally .
no , thanks . i 'm on the clock .
well , if you 're looking for something to do ,
that is her job .
he won 't tell me why he 's trying to buy all these houses .
hold on .
well , hello there .
will he be gone for a while ?
if sure is a mess in here .
you wanna know what 's going on ? talk to your husband .
that 's between you and him .
i get that .
when i tell people you attacked me ,
you think the police are gonna care about that ?
you can 't be doing this . i already got two strikes .
really , i don 't .
hey , hon .
or you 're gonna play golf ? this sounds like fun .
bob ? you 're going with bob ?
in that case , ditch the moisturizer .
relax . i already laid the groundwork .
and what did they say about the age difference ?
what ? why ?
i don 't even think they 're gonna notice .
i was . now i just cook for fun .
so as long as it doesn 't come in a can ,
ah , no . mary 's the one with the stories .
yes , take a wild guess .
as matter of fact ,
no . no , because i realize that as a doctor ,
so the army ..

i 'm barbara fine .
the nanny .
i 'm gonna call my daughter and see if there are
she 's good .
okay , done . you ready to go ?
hey , bob , can i borrow a couple of eggs ?

why would you even go there ?
or should i say " flipper " ?
did he tell you about
we don 't need to .
what ?
he told me what you 've got planned for our neighbors .
to say the least .
i just couldn 't go back to that table and face your mother .
i was afraid of how you 'd react .
oh , keith ,
i always knew there was an expiration date
you are 17 years younger than me .
not to me .
there are other considerations .
who cares ?
if i didn 't know you any better , i 'd say that you 're one of those
i don 't need a vacation .
and i 'd also like you to know the most-often received
read , rest , travel .
sarcasm ?
that tonight 's gonna be a good night
fine . just get back under your blanket ,
fine .
i know you turned around .
turn it over .
this is really happening .
i 'm gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle
they 're gonna need an extra-large veil for somebody 's head .
why wouldn 't you ?
so you 're saying if i became a famous movie star ,
if i 'm gonna be stuck at home with the kids
so , you think about us getting married ?
i think about us getting married ,
joke all you want , but you think about it .
good luck catching a man with that attitude .
this vacation is off to a wonderful stant .
i 'm excited to work with my boyfriend .

i have plenty of experience in biology .
and .
let 's do this .
no " hi , rai " ?
so , listen , i heard something about him .
ooh , gossip .
so i hung out there for , like , a month ,
follow your heart .
she makes more money than me .
it 's completely reasonable .
yeah , actually , it 's good for both of us
the vespa 's almost paid off .
it 's the width of a single hair .
so i 'm sure it 's no problem for a genius like you .
i 'm on vacation .
social convention is stupid .
i have ten fingers and ten toes .
what can i get you ?
don 't let me have too many of those .
we 're grown men ; we drink at bars .
everything okay with you and bernadette ?
you and amy ? good ?
you know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens .
you 've told us that a thousand times , sid .
okay , it 's clear .
papa , there will come a time .
with what money. girl ?
i 'd rather die with my face to the enemy than to run away .
i suggest you leave this country as quickly as you can .
my friend needs your help .
you didn 't tell me he was working with the enemy .
i got the note .
we 're going to get you out of here .
i 'm sorry .
" noted economist altackedin home . "
i 've been trying to piece this thing together .
yeah , you bored the hell out of ' em , right ?
i don 't know . did you ?
i am trying to be serious here .
hi . i , uh , i called earlier about
let me walk you to the director 's office .
since your husband is declared legally dead ,
okay . when your call came in and kishida processed it ..
kaniel outis ...
hey , kishida ?
okay , but you and i both know who michael scofield was .
the official record .. history ...
now , that 's scary , to think who could be behind that .
it would take a genius .. like michael .
you 're coming with us .
what 's wrong with the suburbs ?
the front line of the war .
pay up .
then you get your money .
yes ?
what am i looking at ?
one of those motion sensor devices you hang on trees ,
amazing .
you know my game , whip .
because you 're my whip hand .
yeah , sure , okay .
be everyone 's friend till the moment you 're not .
that 's game theory .
even if it 's at everyone else 's expense .
leaving his family , and-and the new identity .
always an agenda , right ?
he might initially think smaller evils are okay
but the dance of good and evil could become jumbled ,
they 're going to kill me , you know .
but the monsters in there ,
you were responsible for killing the lights ,
maybe i can find another way .
give me a piece of that gum .
it 'll start the process .
we don 't make it back , he keeps it .
fine .
look what they 've done to it .
he 's only gotten more powerful
just give me a little something .
you should have thought about that
oh , allah . kaniel outis says it was a misunderstanding .
an honest man doesn 't try to escape .
i 'd have left you in solitary forever if it was up to me .
rebels .... .
son of a bitch .
the question is : is the sheik even inside ?
they find us up here ,
guiet .
troublesome children .
but perhaps too modern for this country .
and my son ,
i went to visit him a few weeks ago .
a way i could help .
you agreed to help him .
the case is currently under investigation .
how could he just check himself out ? !
yeah , well , it 's not much of a rehab center
my husband has been gone all night .
look , even if he did have a relapse . i 'm sure he 'll be back soon .
i slipped a few sedatives in your tea last night
didn 't wanna find you sprawled out
fine . let me know what you do like for breakfast ,
and into the foreseeable future .
i 'm moving in .
but i 'm fine .
in the light of day . i feel absolutely ...
yeah , and i also got rid of all your knives , razors ,
you can 't . i just thought it was ugly .
you will drive me absolutely crazy .
can you help me with my bag ?
mike , you 're supposed to be sleeping .
you know where . new york .
three weeks .
i 'm not moving to new york .
my plumbing business is here .
scotch . coming right up .
we have to prepare for the worst , lynette .
no , no , listen to me .
what ?
because we 've been riding this emotional roller coaster
so what ? everybody 's got a secret .
and our mechanic does crystal meth .
the world is filled with ordinary people that do nasty things .
let 's get on with our lives .
it makes no sense for me to be depressed ,
he did . he absolutely did .
sweetie , i don 't think he was shot with a stapler .
sorry for just dropping by without calling .
what 's wrong ?
but why kill someone else
none of it makes any sense .
none of them would commit a cold-blooded murder .
what if someone else knows ?
what 'd you say ?
and don 't give me that look .
carlos went a.w.o.l. from rehab last night ,
you know ?
oh , thank god ! i was so worried !
you can tell me the truth . i won 't judge .
really ?
i would think you 'd be an emotional mess right about now .
see , here 's my problem .
you don 't have to believe me .
bree , you need to talk about this .
uh , excuse me . i took intro to psych
they became my concern when i caught you
i can ' .
and by the way .
in fact , i don 't think you care about anyone at all ,
no ! not until i 'm convinced you are no longer
i will not go through that again .
you have got to stop smiling .
i 'm just so relieved .
yeah , we were very lucky .
it 's no big deal .
oh , i 'm so glad .
oh , no . oh .
he did a lovely job .
well , that 's when the news came in about detective vance ,
so who 's this person you assaulted ?
and she thinks those two little words ..
many years ago ,
but somehow , when i was alone in that hotel room ,
and now that i 've had time to think about it ..
hey ! look who 's here with a pizza and a dvd .
hey , thanks again for giving up your trip .
no problem .
she must be furious .
tom , i know women .
no , it 's weird , but , uh ,
well , i 'll give you an example .
what ?
i know , i know . the second i said it ,
but my mother gave me some ice chips ,
we 'll let you get back in there .
that baby is so irritating .
aw , he 's already taking after uncle shelly .
well , if you got weed , cancel the coffee .
and little man tate over there is in a mood .
uh , hello .
in korea , your heads would be on sticks
f.y.i. , tiny dancer ,
he is gorgeous .
our new machine will be here any minute .
or should i say a latte more cappuccino-y ?
and as for that " special price " oleg said he 'd give us ?
she must really like to cook outside .
no , i 'm looking for sophie .
look , this is a long way to go
i 'm not doing it for the free cappuccino machine .
you know , it 's a page out of shakespeare , and i 'm puck .
am i the only one who 's read a book ?
i gotta go grab ' em .
okay , good . now we 've got the power on ,
holy mother of god !
max , caroline , your shift started three minutes ago .
what is wrong with her ?
you two still haven 't figured out this machine ?
i 'm good with this kind of stuff .
hey , han 's a man , according to recent lore .
okay , let 's see . here 's the steam one .
it burned my neck !
luckily you 're not taller .
that cappuccino machine might have just
i 'm sorry , oleg . sophie 's moved on .
yeah , but not in your neighborhood .
she had the decency to do it on a stoop in staten island .
we were going to travel the world together .
hey , what 's this area back there ?
i should check it out .
is oleg in here ?
that delicious mix of man and butter .
oh , honey , i could 've told you that .
wait till you see what happens
i don 't work for you .
oh , i have to get this .
but we used to have the same machine
no , i am not working at starbucks .
just for two hours .
tamp it in , pack it down , turn it on .
honestly , all i heard was group head .
place the steam wand halfway in the pitcher
syrups , powders , whipped cream is right here .
i think i can handle it . i went to wharton .
that 's not what i said .
girl , you 're good at this .
i am good . i think i 'm getting the hang of this .
or ohio .
i 'll have a tall drip , extra hot .
i 'd say it 's pretty obvious .
why ?
chania , please ?
it is safe here .
you got any food for him ?
and why were you trying to take out kaniel outis ?
you weren 't supposed to .
i 'll tell you everything you want to know .
ican have you prosecuted .
you 're not calling him junior , are you ?
he 's an amazing kid .
he was tightening his control over me ,
when i knew poseidon had gone rogue
he 's not gonna hurt mike .
if you remove his mask ,
that 's the point , no one knows him .
you play his game . you wear your own mask .
i 'll get to the states as soon as i can .
yeah ?
a naval alert just went out .
it was reported by the ship 's captain .
ran into a few bodies :
back in the good old days , when the mob really knew
interesting pattern to this wound .
well , it 's an l-shaped wound , so , not a rock .
well , maybe there was a struggle at the edge of the water .
shirt 's torn .
so , calculated pmi is four to seven hours .
guy 's out here in the middle of nowhere
and who was he with ?
found a bloody print on the inside of the box .
it 's all goat 's blood ?
but in the meantime , the print 's pretty good .
you got to see this .
you sure ?
see there ?
sorry . haven 't gotten that far yet .
well , maybe his neighbor 's got the rest of your billy goat .
you think he killed walter burns
i 'll run the print .
gas company 's drilling right in his lap .
no priors . he 's been here for 40 years .
well , if his prints are on that box ,
i didn 't see any livestock .
no oil leak .
let 's see if mr. gibson 's here .
we only want to understand what 's going on .
let me show you .
i don 't mean to insult your intelligence ,
the cuyahoga , just outside of cleveland .
did you know they were both sick ?
have you seen your doctor recently ?
you can read about it in my article .
unfortunately , all my sources keep dying on me .
have you ever heard of " fracking " ?
look it up .
very well .
good .
yeah .
i analyzed the sample we collected from mr. gibson 's well .
i pulled the clinical autopsy reports
this is the analysis from the water found
so walter burns
we need to warn people .
a water sample from one well
what ?
then they pump millions of gallons of water , sand
so they 're drilling right through the aquifer in cable springs ,
the valve 's loose , about a quarter turn .
i think somebody set up our trucker cody trimble
trimble gets out to fix his tire ,
this wasn 't an accident .
and what looks like some hair .
i think we know what made walter burns ' head wound .
but what he got was a beretta to the head .
cody trimble drove walter 's body out to the hot springs .
right . so ...
that 's some serious company loyalty .
that 's it . case closed .
you 're going to let some corporate lawyers
you got your evidence . you got the bad guy .
well , we still need a water sample
because walter burns drowned in
killer 's dead .
well , leonard and penny are our best friends .
they said it 's the perfect gift .
you don 't ..
don 't be silly .
do you think when krypto the superdog is out flying ,
nobody 's gonna die
late , and with an attitude .
of course she thinks that .
well , what other career option do you have , caroline ?
no , wait , your shop didn 't last six months .
oh , i 'm already there . and now i 'm back .
and we have to tell them to stop
and now they 're not making noise .
it 's max and caroline .
hi . yeah , it 's not a good time .
and , obviously , i 'm beyonce .
look at all the single ladies .
jay z and i have a lot in common .
where should i put this ?
put it anywhere you want .
look , you two may be crazy in love ,
oh , come on . we 're not in love .
oh , no , you 're right .
is it really a reward if it comes from cvs ?
or are all the lanes reserved ?
wait , you 've never been to oleg 's apartment ?
you 'd be surprised by my apartment , sophie .
yeah , well , that sounds nice .
any advice or pills ?
and you didn 't use my college fund
but if that didn 't work ,
caroline will be at oleg 's .
the last time i was stoned
look at us , max ,
oh , it 's this way .
now , what movie should we watch ?
is there one where shrek has cancer ?
what is caroline doing here ?
i am at oleg 's .
you told him this was our apartment ?
i 'm not letting anyone leave
are we not smoking weed ?
i don 't know what his problem is .
why doesn 't he fire himself for missing puberty ?
she spent her morning dusting a strap-on .
and now this pig is as cold as your family is gonna be
my dad does not like to be pork teased .
the attraction was immediate .
we dated for six months .
and then , he suddenly disappeared .
just some peanut shells on the floor
not to mention the fact that joe gets claire in the deal .
runs a company , hell of a role model .
you know what , phil and claire have already raised their kids .
there .
you have , like , a hundred missed calls from gloria .
is everything okay ?
there must be a bus stop nearby .
okay , why are you whispering only part of a sentence ?
really ?
ay , manny , you 're too young .
yeah , you should be out sowing your oats
i don 't see what the big deal is .
i 'm thinking maybe a loft in an up-and-coming arts district .
the main thing is , he 's my brother .
ay . manny . you 're so sweet .
oh , just leave it .
i deserve that .
well , you broke my heart .
when we first met , you were just ...
your missouri twang .
i 'm on it .
call me when you have him .
just call me ! it 's a simple extraction .
i got this , dad !
shit ! not again .
the b.p.r.d. sends you down here ,
come on , i 'm here to bring you back in .
so come on , bring me in .
okay . hey , what happened to you , man ?
training ? training for what ?
okay . hang on to that for me .
ouch !
can we get out of here ?
ruiz ! let 's have a drink and talk about this !
buddy , come on . come on , don 't you remember ?
you 're different .
if my face could talk , it would disagree with you .
the end is coming . the end of what ?
that and something about anung nun ...
bollocks !
and lucky for you , too .
that 's the thing about sand ,
if we weren 't here ,
that 's a false equivalence and you know it .
the answer to every threat we face
i want an army ,
those who have lived in dust ,
i need to see some id , love .
you gonna tell us what happened down there ?
he 's dead . he offered me the sword , excalibur .
all right , so where is it ?
miss todd , you have no idea .
i 've made a deposit at the local bank .
henry , there are more than i ever thought possible .
so ? why don 't you like my boyfriend ?
i 'm just 90 % sure he 's 100 % gay .
but then ... we made out .
there was even a little .. under-the-shirt action .
heads up ! coming through !
what ? i 'm not selling this bad boy .
or ...
yeah . yeah .
oh , every time . every time he loses weight ,
oh , these aren 't for sale .
you know you 're taking those jeans out of the hands
oh . right . well , then how about a donation ?
how much for the ashtray ?
50 cents : but there 's a chip in it .
i 'll give you 35 .
it 's from golombia .
okay , fine .
all the other girls , for their talent ,
uncle grumpy .
not leaving till i see it .
so what do you need here ?
how do we make this happen ?
you see nothing .
after weeks of rehearsing ,
no . i won .
but it was very humiliating .
and yet , you kept him all these years .
you 're wrong , whoever you are .
i feel so alone .
huh ? you had a girlfriend ?
so one year , i asked her to go
oh , no .
don 't worry . it 's a good thing .
you walk around school ,
and what i want is to see a puppet show .
yeah , i know . i can feel air on it .
oh , uh , today is your lucky day .
you might need a belt .
don 't do that .
well , we ruined alex 's life , by the way .
unless that 's a problem for you .
may be we should settle it .
please , let 's not do it , all right ?
right . listen , please .
and i 'm not trying to get all sweaty in this .
look , what 's the problem ?
i mean , we 've gone hard .

but if you push past it and get outta your head ..
i can get over an old knee injury , okay ?
what i con 't want to iisk is this .

i have to say. uh , after reading your questionnaire ,
can we please get sparkling instead of tap ,
yes , ma 'am .
i-i mean , uh , just yes .
good , because you don 't seem like a ma 'am .
you are not good at this .
i never thought i 'd let my family set me up , either ,
for now . i plan to be managing a hotel in the next five years .
he 's a smoker , so fingers crossed .
uh , eyes like sandra bullock ,
but now ,
oh , i 'm definitely nice .
if you 're not serious about this ,
thank you , but you don 't have to do this . i 'm fine .
really ? we 're joking about this now ?
i didn 't mean to just drop all of this on you .
course i do . it 's just different than yours .
you recovered the weather runes without incident ?
i re-gifted it . we 're not all as adaptable as you .
it 's also a useful object on which to record it .
i 'm in a sentimental mood .
we have had a good run .
free sample , father ?
i 'd think twice about that .
you know the level of enchantment they are getting from that .
yeah .
kaulder . it has been too long .
when they 're used on humans , it is . they 're mixing them in the cupcakes .
notice this ?
max , you 're too smart to go down that road .
more than anyone in history , actually .
more than i scare you ?
the man who came to see me has an odor on his skin .
arsenic . anything else ?
the one who cursed dolan ?
yet most of us aren 't like him , you know . we 're the same as you .
you 've got magic in your blood . magic that can do very bad things .
oh , yes .
yes , my bar !
but i 'm not blaming you for destroying my life or anything .
an observation on how you destroyed my life .
look , i don 't like it any more than you do ,
that we have green skin and like to wear pointy hats
but what if those women really were witches ?
see , i remember thinking if it was me found guilty ,
hey , kid . i was afraid i was too late .
okay .
here .
thank you .
i thought my immortality was the way that she punished me .
i 'm afraid i bear some responsibility .
i 've seen what comes next .
the witch queen will cast another plague curse .
the witch prison .
waiting to exact revenge .
now i 'm right back where i started .
kaulder ,
kaulder .
but my enemies came to call it " hexenbane . "
our agreement depended on me keeping you safe .
if i get hurt now , i stay hurt . where would that leave you ?
who says that a witch can 't hunt witches ?
kaulder .
when the spell is done , the fly swarm will be released .
stay close .
my god !
the queen 's using their power to release the plague .
the chant .
but the witch queen 's linking their minds like a chain .
every chain has a weak link .
that 's right .
they won 't do it .
you trust them to keep that promise ?
then this is your future .
bul not me .
you , unfortunately , will not be alive to see that i am right .
i 'm sure she can survive 10 minutes on our balcony .
no . you had an understanding .
your mere presence gives me cause , my lady .
surely , a creature such as you
and if you were to return as my wife ?
you may consider it a compliment .
i have no wish to become your wife .
i would have expected nothing less .
is this normal
what 's wrong ?
i 'll tell them it was my choice .
i have to take you back .
if you ride you have a chance .
e does not deserve this .
i 'm perfectly all right .
senator ?
i would be grateful for your mercy .
the lady cassia has saved your life .

i thought that ,
the same look i saw in rome
now rome has followed us back to pompei
a terrible waste of good wine .
it is the gods .
perhaps .
tonight i saw the man who killed my whole family .
is that really what the audience will want to see ?
don 't you think they 'd rather see
stop .
titus will have your entire family hung from the city walls
cassia ...
your family will become my family ,
is that what you want ?
and if you reverse this decision ,
can your reputation bear such a weakness ?
i think the wedding shall be in rome .

galahad is dead . hence , we have just drunk a toast to him .
valentine can send his signal to any of them , all of them ,
and that 's it
and we only drink it when we lose a kingsman .

as mayor of new holland ,
the man is a menace !
have you looked through this science book they 're using ?
when i was a kid , pluto was a great planet .
in fairness , he didn 't write the textbook .
your neighbor , of course .
thinks he 's great .
yes .
ladies , gentlemen .
is that right word , " ignorant " " ?
your country does not make enough scientist .
you should be a scientist , victor .
they like what science gives them , but not the questions , no .
actually , i have a question .
the first time , did you love your experiment ?
and the second time ?
then you changed the variables .
science is not good or bad , victor .
that is why you must always be careful

that 's it . work it !
you know what ?
no , none of this is normal !
i was finally happy here ... there , where i lived .

7th-grade girls are mean !
we will resume the finding of mimom .
she 's just " my " mom .

it is possible i will continue making hilarious mistakes .
that is not making me feel better .
my mom says your mistakes are what make you human .
and that we could to make them better ..
we were told the humans were simple and backwards .
but i am thinking now .
to earthland .
gratuity tucci .
it was a new home , a new country .
but i was this nerd from barbados .
i know when the other boovs said " oh . "
the true is , among boov , i do not fit in .
she is so amazing
i cannot wait to meet mimom .
she even cares about me .
the boov may be superior in many ways
big deal !

all right , a few words about jules .
this whole idea was hatched at jules ' kitchen table
she was online in four months .
she 's now up to 216 .
hey , ben , are you gonna wear a suit every day ?
you 've been through a lot .
how long do you think she 'll be mad at me for ?
i mean , i assume you talked to her , apologized ,
what did you do , send her a tweet ?
i , like , texted her a billion times .
but it was like , a nice e-mail .
it feels great , actually . thank you .
well , i haven 't sat at a desk for a while .
no , i get it .
let me see what i can do .
and , honestly , i think he would run our business
oh , and ..
matt seems like a terrific guy .
sorry , didn 't mean to interrupt .
who ? the dad ?
if you can , try to pull this towards you ,
okay , so then put that on lightly .
you want a slice ?
cheers .
i saw him arrive . how 'd that go ?
until he called us ..
apparently , selling clothes makes us a " chick site . "
i couldn 't agree more . i find that surprising .
i just knew , at the end of the day ,
see ? that 's what i mean .
mm . you have a favorite quote ?
" you 're never wrong to do the right thing . "
but i 'm pretty sure mark twain said it first .
uh , geez . sam cooke , one of my all-time favorites .
oh , she was great , right ?
oh , yeah .
you told me to transfer him .
first of all , that was yesterday .
thank you .
not the word i would use ,
no . no , no , no . no , please don 't apologize .

let me get one of those .
maybe come up with a better plan ?
happy to .
yeah , no , i get it .
you know she has a business degree from penn ?
i mean , i forgot , but i know .
that would be very nice .
it 's cool . i can handle it .
yeah , why is that ?
obviously .
we 're like your sister wives .
excitin9 .
maybe .
anyway , the only thing is ,
when do you have to go ?
do you want to come ?
oh , that sounds awesome . um ...
i get to comb my hair with a fork ....
this is jules .
i mean , if you can 't zoom in , you probably won 't buy .
oh , boy .
she doesn 't have an alarm , right ?
what if there 's , like , a password on the e-mail ? hmm ?
jules said she 'd buy her a new one , so it 's a win-win .
this is like an " oceans " movie .
his name is elliott gould .
thank you .
uh , you are ben affleck 's brother .
i think that 's kind of self-explanatory .
thank you .
park on the street .
damon , affleck 's brother , you 're with me .
i have no idea . ben , listen to me .
that is a fake alarm that she bought
it 's just to scare off burglars .
oh , well , it 's doing a good job .
they 're the cheapest people in america .
it 's still beeping .
trust me on this one . have you found the computer ?
lewis , go in there . davis , in there .
hi , emily .
oh , are you mait 's dad ?
that 's okay ?
tough ? jules ? sure . she 's a total badass .
must make you guys proud , huh ?
so , bravo , good for her . right ?
not that that is a reason to stay together .
let 's take that one off your plate right now .
i happen to have space , okay ?
and to think i didn 't even want to hire you .
you 're facing a fire-breathing dragon .
because you don 't have a girlfriend ?
do you really want that ?
it doesn 't matter .
what 's it thinking about now ?
um , rai , there 's someone i want you to meet .
okay , i 'm going to play it cool .
look at that . i have a date .
and now for dessert ...
bam ! that 's what i 'm talking about !
i was thinking , " hey , did you hear the one about ... ?
oh , she 's here .
she says she 's sorry she 's late .
okay .... ?
it took me a few days to work up the nerve
yeah .
i 'm talking to you first .
i love what we have .
i 'm in love with you , link .
but i have been sitting with it for a few days ,
welcome back , dr. bailey .

they were happy to help .
somebody help me , please !
oh , sorry . the er 's this way . what happened ?
okay , what happened ?
wait . why were you rushing to the er ?
there 's a fish inside of there .

he started hacking up like crazy .
kai 's the best on the team .
does he drink or smoke ?
all the places in the world to put food ...
how do you people eat here ?
richard , you don 't have to do this .
forgiving me or
it 's called ... eating .
especially not from you .
i honestly worry for your entire gender sometimes .
we didn 't think he was gonna do it .
just start going crazy , and it goes in deeper , deeper .
and then it kind of puffed up .
and according to this x-ray , this thing 's got spikes .
or that the fish could be poisonous .
i 'm-a call the bar , see what kind of fish it was .
oh , yeah . write it down .
she told us not to do anything stupid .
you haven 't seen one , by chance , have you ?
yep . i don 't think it 's down here .
are you okay ?
it happens with , um ... anxiety .
the tube 's only a temporary fix . we need to open him up .
he doesn 't have a minute . the coils have failed .
tried it your way . now help me with mine .
it keeps breaking into smaller pieces .
the er 's just like , " hold my beer . "
he was feeling good and
except ... if he just didn 't swallow the fish , man .

we didn 't take her kids , ellie .
those kids were living like feral cats in a crack house .
i mean , sharon said she 's been clean for four months .
look at the way lizzy 's looking at her .
we didn 't take her kids , ellie .
so we went to the school and joined her in the cafeteria .

that might be the dumbest thing you 've ever said .
i am not breaking up with her .

he tells me everything .
now , we can go by ourselves . me and you .
maybe " whore " is too strong .
why 'd she have to come here , anyway ?
excuse me , doctor .
but you go ahead . your job 's more important .
that 's just business .
i know .

i want you to listen to me .
i 'm gonna be out .
you keep on telling me that .

but you 'll learn to love again , right ?
well , keep an eye on the tier for me , will you ?
i need to know the time .
because he 's arranging the plane.why the sudden curiosity ?
the less you know , the better .
i have to go . i 'll meet you in pl .
you could get thrown in the shu for that .
i don 't know what ..
i don 't care . say it .
man , she 's wound up tight .
i won 't see another one of these in my lifetime .
you 're doing the flip ,
yes , sir .
do i ?
she 'll destroy their confidence .
oh , no , sir .
i mean , they 're your babies .
no , that 's the first thing you 've said
everything after that is ...
well , the doctors have planned and rehearsed this for weeks .
karev , you rushed it . you 're like two steps ahead of me .
yours over mine , everything 's fine .
that 's how it works .
you pulled me out of a once-in-a-lifetime surgery
spinal separation complete .
it 's been two weeks now .
i gotta go .
wait . hold on . what about complications ?
i 'll , uh , see if two does it .
this is good stuff .
there 's beauty in the basics .
step by step .
about 80 % of the tumor had been vaporized
i passed a brush through the scope to clear the field .
suction , kepner .
yang ?
sats dropped to 88 .
at that point , dr. webber exercised his judgment and stepped in .
you know , i would love to go back
you hush . no one 's interested in your life .
please ask me aboua spleen .
or a pancreas . i 've got a very good view of it .
derek shepherd .
zero silk .
they 're separating the colon right now .
have they done the flip thing yet ?
um , i gotta get outta here .
um .. yeah . across the street .
he has a job .
that we accidentally got pregnant
of how long we 'll stay together
we love each other , and we wanted these babies .
including accepting the hospital 's charity ,
really . i-i just ...
looks like andi has the bulk of the blood supply to the colon .
flip 's coming up ,
i 'm a little nervous about it .
i just don 't want to screw this up .
and you 're not comfortable doing it with her ?
i get it . you don 't need to say another word .
no , that 's not what i meant .
you sure you can do this ?
so i proceeded with the laser endoscopy
do you mind if i run out for a minute
i know . i can get out and make it back in that time .
he 's a nice man . you could do without me for half an hour .
he won 't bite .
you can run , but you can 't hide .
now why on earth do you want to rush it
b-because my life is happening now ,
a-and if that 's not what you want ,
okay . look at this face .
yeah , yeah , yeah , super cute .
bailey spent the last two hours
look , keep looking .
he 's been under too long .
is this really what you want on your record ?
check under the liver again .
dr. bailey , the sponge is on the bottom of your shoe .
what ...
why aren 't we getting any urine ?
he was the one who suggested the transplant .
you what ?
honest to god .
no , that 's not right .
it was easier than taking candy from a baby .
removing clamp .
we have urine .
good job .
so we cracked his chest
yeah , i can do this all day ,
i like tuck .
i like dinosaurs and transformers
i know you don 't come without tuck .
i know who you are .
nothing ?
one step at a time .
hmm . you were a monster .
