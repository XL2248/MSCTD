two guys walk in , one walks out .

everybody from chief so@@ to to the fbi to the whole god@@ damn world

did the hunters put a cel@@ l-@@ based tr@@ acker
he@@ y. listen , can you check with a cell phone company ,
are they gonna run it down ?
but , christ , jenny , that 's amazing .
well , if he had a name , he 'd be mine .

it must be far from the tower
nobody 's got the manpower to search that many storage yards .

i just came here for one thing .
i 'm sorry about your uncle brian .

you love to speak with the dragon . so do i .
hi , another me .
how are they getting the package out of chicago ?
nothing . okay ?
god damn it .

but enough that both fires turned on each other , away from the building
and yet wic@@ ek was still consumed .
so here 's my question .
did you want him to burn ?
you have no idea .
i do .
those two men with the pretend names ,
given the kel@@ vin required for ignition was minimal .
ah . oh , you 'll need to find a battery for it , and i was never here .
just keep those dead kids off my desk , huh ?
there you are .
come on , come on , come on .
surprise , surprise . no diversion blast today .
hey ! show me your hands ! show me your fucking hands !

keep those hands where i can see them .
you 're both under arrest ... .
ye@@ p . you 're up for car@@ pool .
have you ever seen aids ?
besides , tam@@ my 's mom says that all the aids are in new york ...
let 's just stick to science , okay ?
we do have vi@@ als of hiv ,
you 've seen something worse ?
i work in one of the saf@@ est places in the world .
morning , ma 'am .
hey .
ah , what do we have here ?
haz@@ leton .
ye@@ p . well , hello , monkey 0@@ 53 .
it looks like a spleen .
what 's wrong ?
uh , a blood clo@@ t , i think .
what would cause that ?
and , if this is a pri@@ mate , it 's probably sh@@ f .
si@@ mian hemor@@ r@@ hag@@ ic fever .
where ever this guy came from ,
it ri@@ ps the hell out of the inside of monkeys ,
if this monkey has si@@ mian fever , you 're looking for
i never know how to deci@@ pher your level of sar@@ cas@@ m .
kind of like a level 3 ?
stick with ac@@ erb@@ ic .
code three . medical tear , lock two .
whatever it is , it didn 't get me .
i 'm observing blood in the powder .
sir , we have a duty to warn haz@@ leton .
i don 't even know where to start .
well , there you go .
i already have the lab
the package was for my study .
i 've already told haz@@ leton that it 's si@@ mian fever .
in there has two rare and deadly diseases ?
they sent us samples of sh@@ f , which i 've been expecting for weeks ,
no , that .. that 's experience .
look , enough of this cra@@ p , okay ?
i was about to introduce ebola zaire to the sample tissue .
all your samples were compromised during sterilization , ma 'am .
all right , one second . excuse me .
well , fantastic !
can you pick up the kids this afternoon ?
i can 't afford those places , not the good ones .
boy ...
you can walk as fast as you want ,
what is wrong with cal@@ lie ? she still hasn 't called me back .
hey , ross ?
and ask torres if she can pick up the kids today ?
don 't you think i tried ? there 's an emergency ,
i don 't think he 's gonna last 20 minutes .
there is nothing you can say after this morning
dude , you and your rich boy problems .
i think she actually likes steph@@ an@@ ie .
stand up for your girl .
so what are you gonna do ?
you know , it 's like walking into a hor@@ net 's nest .
sorry . pardon me .
what are you doing here ?
the night of the gala ? at your house , remember ?
yeah . don 't worry . i won 't tell anyone what happened .
uh , you could probably be more useful
okay , sweet girl , just one more .
these are my regular eyes .
your dad passed his stress test .
good .
sorry . i came to see if your drain output picked up
you 're not progressing very quickly here .
you said that you would go if i set it up .
no , see , i never said that .
you tell someone you 're gonna do something ,
your family . make your children hate you .
but i don 't want to let you down , too .
now let me see . did i miss anything else ?
that 's what 's called a rhetorical question , my dear .
uh , dr. a@@ very , can you elaborate
yes , i saw evidence of that earlier this morning .
well , it 's possible he 's gonna need a skin graft ,
wherever they live .
suction , dear , come on .
wh@@ oa , dial it back for a second .
no , she 's fine . are you ?
she is my patient ,
probably should have checked back earlier .
i 'd like to start you on antibiotics .
because there 's a left shift ?
murphy ..
and you didn 't answer , so i went to check .
i helped you inside ...

i told you , " look inside "
i don 't have it anymore .

sorry , i just ..
play@@ ful ?
but can i ask you , i mean , if you don 't mind ..

so you threw it away ?
the photograph ?
it was a beauty .
my mom .
1@@ il@@ ke , 17 hours .
really great .
that 's what you 're having right there , man .
in the space of two hours . it was crazy .
i never checked
i think this works
this says it all
not an employee .
there 's the picture sean wanted . 25 .
yes , hi .
i 'm dr. adam@@ son . and you come this way with me ?
all right .
he 's up there for work .
bet you wish you kept driving , huh ?
and take a deep breath .
oh , thank god we were on the first floor .
dou@@ che .

oh ! i 'm sorry . sorry .
uh , yeah , i 'll be right there .
we 're just gonna examine you ,
where is my dad ?

they 'll see you after , okay ? they 're saying you 're a hero .
who is he talking about ?
roy he is fine .
her air@@ way was completely closed off .
what 's going on ?

cris@@ tina , scru@@ b out , go see if you can help@@ . go .
we had to start a central line .
oh , my god .
these burns on your chest are pretty minor .
you never looked .
let 's go find mommy , huh ?
that 's when we go looking for a second opinion .
they 're all good doctors .
what do you think this was for ?
but this was for me .
at least i was able to do that .
maybe it 's not one doctor .
who don 't know each other
there was chaos .
chaos .
and to fund his operations ,
what the hell is someone gonna do with a giant worm ?
what can 't you do with it ?
i wouldn 't bother .
sounds like a duck hunt to me .
a deco@@ y . a diversion .
why would they want just this one when they 've got the keys
and we are the cause .
but like all living organisms ,
they are part of the earth 's natural defense system .
but if governments are allowed to contain them , destroy them ,
unless we restore balance .
a dead , char@@ red world , overrun by monsters ?
moscow , london , washington , d.@@ c .
on every continent , the tit@@ ans are triggering
their behavior has become random .
no . signal 's too weak .
how many nu@@ kes do you have ?
we could help him .
is where king gh@@ id@@ or@@ ah is n@@ esting .
so this plan is what you would call a " long shot , " right ?
you ain 't hear ' em , gri@@ ffin ?
we 'll be out of range while you 're down there ,
all citizens to report to the nearest evacuation center
massive storms and other disasters
the grim search continues , as people around the world
cities around the globe have fallen
the creatures just think it 's another apex predat@@ or .
i mean , we are a bunch of hor@@ ny mur@@ der@@ ous carni@@ vo@@ res .
we track it , we find it , and we get my daughter back .
god@@ z@@ illa will bring balance .
we got about 12 minutes before he goes ther@@ mon@@ uc@@ lear .
i 'm saying in about 12 minutes ,
it 's pretty rare that i don 't manage to ..
i 'm gu@@ essing the bre@@ ed@@ ers aren 't singing in praise of the lord .
i 'm done here .
yeah .
i think you 're going to do really well here , cam@@ mie .
welcome .
i want you to put on your clothes and leave .
this movie 's weird .
you knew that was going to happen .
i wouldn 't know what to do .
i really didn 't know it was going to happen .
i didn 't have a choice .
i will not pray for god to change me
i must be the change .
then when i learned that that was a sin , also ,
you can 't get a pass from god to jer@@ k off .
steve , what are you experiencing ?
it 's like watching michael angelo paint the si@@ s@@ tine chapel .
that is why i 'm laughing .
fuck you . no , it 's not working on me at all .
please ... please don 't stop . and so i cry sometimes
and i wake in the morning
" dear cameron , i 'm very angry at you
when i think of how long it took me
you were making a lot of noise .
what were you dreaming about ?
maybe the most amazing part of ad@@ on@@ is creed 's journey , roy .
... ... is that tonight , he fights ...
three years ago , that 's a kno@@ ck@@ out .
you got him . stay on him !
and a big left hook lands flush !
come on , now ! hands up ! hands up !
tell him , don@@ nie !
come on , baby !
can 't say i 'm proud of what our sport 's become ,
sounds to me like you just trying to get paid .
" the rum@@ ble in the jungle " didn 't just manifest itself .
will it into existence .
you see anybody else standing here with a care in their heart ?
yeah ? what 's that ?
you know that ?
four ?
the belt ain 't enough .
your dad , he knew that .
not ready to give up yet .
okay ! come to me !
ready ?
dra@@ go trying to end it .
get back ! get back to your corner !
obey my commands .
extend the right , crack him with the left .
one early observation , max .
box .
dra@@ go with a huge left hook .
dra@@ go on the attack again , now driving creed back into the ropes .
er@@ nie .
there 's proof ! i left a note !
but you deserve children of your own .
i mean , we don 't want those sar@@ cos sne@@ aking up on us
i 'm not going anywhere .
i 'll protect you from the sar@@ co brothers .
they are beautiful .
now , everyone , sho@@ o ! my babies need their sleep ! now sho@@ o !
now 's our chance .
we can set the time machine
we won 't get in any trouble !
it 's about going back where we belong !
a h !
but the initi@@ alization sequence won 't even run
don 't eat me ! i 'm mostly fat !
with all the earthquakes and the rising tar ,
and when we get rid of ty@@ ra , the upper valley is ours for the taking
we 've got news all right , bosses .
ty@@ ra 's had babies ! three of them !
no , she said they were her own !
another egg , huh ?
and then we can take care of her , once and for all .
i can 't wait to teach them everything i know .
i can 't tell where they go .
they 're coming from the river !
hey , mom ! are you gonna let them leave the nest , huh ?
and it 'll be good practice for them .
why would you do this to me ?
don 't you know i would never let that happen ?
don 't you know that ?
hi , and ... i loaded your pan@@ try with g@@ ush@@ ers .
he practices .
and a year later he goes back to the reno .
so imagine if jones just said .
to bird
there are no two words in english language
no. man , no .
but i tried
and i 'll never apologize for how i tried .
hey , andrew .
you understand what i 'm saying ?
done , sir .
you 're right ... for your cooking skills ...
how do you live like this , tiger ?
your salary has been lying un@@ touched
how can i spend when i 'm never here ?
wow .. how much have you saved ?
but your money will rot in the agency 's bank ..
no ... i 'm not married yet .
i don 't get to meet nice girls .
nothing much ..
someone who 'd make me want to live only for her .
thank you
maybe a little .
yes .... . so that i get to know him better .
come to his house tomorrow morning .
no problem .
thank you .
whenever you are ready .
i 'm getting late for my play rehearsal . see you later .
yes , of course ..
i wanted a boring name .
look at her gorgeous hair ...
you 'll have to get close to the professor now .
they don 't even bolt their doors ...
oh , no ...
mr. writer .... are you asking me out on a date ?
no ... i mean .. we can have a meal ...
join us ... i 'll let you pay the bill .
but i hope you won 't turn up like this ?
keep your foot behind that line .
guys listen .. this is my friend man@@ ish ... he 's from india .
have you ever thrown dar@@ ts ?
you know what ? you don 't look like a writer .
your hands .. they are not like a writer 's ..
why did you become a writer ?
very few people follow their hearts , you 're lucky .
that he should use his head and not his heart .
i admire a man who follows his heart .
so , mr naz@@ ar , what should i do according to your any tips ?
hey , cav@@ eman
what the hell are you saying ?
of course we can@@ . but not on a mission .
and do we have a life beyond these missions or not ?
is zo@@ ya also ?
tiger is a name meant for dogs .
say thank you now ..
you 've chosen a nice girl ..
it 's her play in the evening .
excuse me ?
and that agent got away too ... what the hell are you doing , tiger ?
and that guy would have come to know that i 'm not a writer .
where will the professor be right now ?
let 's run away , zo@@ ya .
god alone knows how long our two countries will keep fighting ...
and it might be a little difficult to run when we 're old .
hurry up .... we have to go to the airport !
we 're getting late for the airport .
sir , we can 't get through to tiger 's phone . he 's out of reach ..
kidnapped ! nonsense !
listen ... this news should not get out .
which bank has he withdrawn the money from ?
sir ... a total of 47 thousand dollars , sir ...
sir ... about 2.3 million ru@@ pe@@ es .
the day i retire .. i 'll blow it all up .
do you have any idea ...
if anyone gets hold of that information ..
sir ... i don 't know exactly where tiger is or what he 's up to ...
i 'm certain about that .
we just heard that ...
what ?
okay .
he 'll help us book the tickets for tomorrow .
might take a long .. maybe all night ... you take care .
there are 201 countries in the world ..
captain abra@@ r ... why have you called me here ?
because i 'm worried about you ...
i am fine .. but you will all have to be a little more patient .
what you 're saying is right ...
he does not suspect me at all ..
i 'll get him to you , but not here ...
i just wanted to see where this decision would take me .
seen anyone like her ?
they look like bloody indians .
captain abra@@ r ...
and no one has shown up .
si@@ r. the information about kazakhstan was wrong .
there were two other big flights that left istanbul yesterday .
then find out from there how many other flights departed ..
total number of passengers 8@@ 25,@@ 8@@ 02 ...
i don 't care .
sir ... my point is ...
we have created tiger !
and will continue even after him .
what is it that they have and we don 't ?
i don 't care ... if you have to shoot him ... then do it
you deserve to be shot .
what have you done ?
201 countries .. there are 201 countries and you ..
then where is she ?
for that i 'll need you and your boys .
yes but those people who she is with right now
our friends .
you want us to attack the isi in cuba ...
girl ?
when you found out she was a pakistani .
whatever needs to be done , should be done now
what the hell is tiger doing ?
sir ... ba@@ bl@@ u .... you 'll be at this point ...
sir ... don 't forget we came here to catch that man
tomorrow morning sharp at eight .
don 't try anything strange at the airport .
get out the back door now , move .
yeah , we got one coming around the corner now .
watch your six .
should have brought more bullets .
but this tasted like ... there 's no other way to say it really .
hey guys , can you please keep it down ?
sorry . i 'm having dinner with gall@@ ag@@ her over here .
you could . you 're funny . your timing is perfect .

fel@@ icia till@@ man framed him .
what do you mean ?
her sister martha was murdered . and , all due respect ,
fel@@ icia may be a few fingers short of a high five ,
i guess all that 's left is a little vacu@@ um@@ ing .
max@@ ine says i can 't go back online
fine . i am sorry , okay ?
what was going through your mind ?
see , my family 's in virginia ,
and even with that extra money .
i know . probably shouldn 't have bought all that .

how long have you been doing this ?
hey , um ... would you mind if we just stayed home
no tie ?
d@@ ang it , susan ! why ?
oh . i think we should save that money
i had a lovely time at the poker game the other day .

i did not have you pe@@ gged as a st@@ oner .
there 's a lot that you don 't know about me .

this is my partner , jay pr@@ it@@ ch@@ et@@ t .
not in the least .
we want this lot ,
it 's not about the huge profits .

the game is on , solve it !
no chance for you to be a hero this time , mr holmes .
to the very best of times , john .
how is this possible ?
i 've only been gone four minutes .

didn 't you ask her what she wanted ?
why didn 't you ask her ?
good afternoon . i am sher@@ lock holmes ,
holmes !
you have come to this agency as a last resort ,
all of this is , of course , perfectly evident from your perfume .
yes , her perfume , which brings insight to me and disaster to you .

oh , you have a case , then , a new one ?
i shall have to go deep .
myself .
am i not beautiful , thomas ?

dr ho@@ op@@ er , i asked mr holmes to come here . cooperate .

you do , actually , quite a lot .
she has been categorically identified .
then who was that in lim@@ e@@ house last night ?
it can 't have been . she was dead , she was here .
he had no reason to lie , could hardly have been mistaken .
a what ? !
hmm ? you know ?
this whole thing could have been planned .

then what 's your theory ?
i , i don 't understand ...
really ?
amaz@@ in@@ q .... what one has to do to get ahead in a man 's world .

and i shall have to go deeper still .
and then under very unexpected circumstances .
hus@@ h , please , this is a matter of supreme importance .
i can tell .
i know when you 're hiding stuff .
you 're growing up so fast .
but every day you 're getting stronger and smarter .
people would always look at us .
they probably thought we were a christian singing group .
i wouldn 't trade that memory for anything .
love bites , doesn 't it ?
he was really sweet .
but trust me , i 'm never seeing him again .
it cost you one guy to face the truth .
now you can move on just like tom .
m@@ m-@@ hmm .
what ?
yeah . why ? is that bad ?
doesn 't she know b@@ ree 's an alcoholic ?
well .. at least this helps explain the way b@@ ree 's been acting lately .
how could we not know this ?
we 're your friends . we wanna help .
a@@ of jo@@ u .
talk to us , swee@@ tie . why are you be@@ having like this ?
it 's not like we can 't see what 's going on .
wow , can 't hide anything from you girls , huh ?
what ?

it 's not a joke .
or the " in crowd " at the virgin terminal ?

he got me in with open space though ,
oh , thank you , yeah , i 'm done .
daddy said you were really good .
it wasn 't my best nic@@ ht but at least he could get ,
what do you mean ?
it 's gonna be delicious .
it will be . can 't wait .
it 's a very big decision , we 're excited .
and they just had their first child .
well , yeah .
want one ?
yes we do .
merry christmas ! merry christmas ! merry christmas !
thank god .
but what worries me are the memory tests that i sent you for .
and there is evidence of decline in your level of mental function .
what , in particular , would you be looking for ?
it would be rare for someone as young as yourself
i really didn 't think that would be necessary .
are we both here on the 17th ?
un-@@ huh , phil and di@@ ane were saying , they might come to town for the weekend .
till it 's clean .
what time is it ?
i 've um , i 've got something wrong with me .
i 've been seeing a neuro@@ logist .
i 'm afraid so .
i 'm afraid is 100 % o .
i don 't think we should tell them .
but we will by then , if i go in next week .
what the hell is the god@@ damn elevator ?
john it 's okay
well , um , everybody .
oh boy .
no , no , it 's nothing like that .
baby how are you feeling ?
one good thing , at least i found out before the next i@@ ui session
anna where are you ? i 'm on my way to a lecture
alice , where the hell were you ?
you 've been gone for two hours , i was worried about you .
well i hope you enjoyed that
i 'm sorry i forgot . i have alzheimer 's .
i told you , i can 't when i 'm running
i hate that this is happening to me .
i am ,
i think you 're doing great recently .
i wish i had cancer .
no , i do . i mean it . i mean ,
in 2013 , we completed exterior repairs ,
we also took away a lot of the old security doors .
i don 't know if you 've experienced this yet with your parents
so we redefined activities to include
starting with knowing about the person
that 's heart@@ breaking
families and friends are welcome any hour , day or night .
well , sunday is the day they usually come by .
that 's a chair alarm ,
it 's just a precautionary measure .
we do have mainly female residents here , but there are men .
do you want to try lun@@ e@@ sta ?
that 's very strong
oh i love it here .
can you believe that that was 30 years ?
oh that was a complicated time , huh ?
yeah , something like that .
me too . we had a great time though .
don 't you wish we had more of them ?
but , yeah , you know , all of it .
so i am , that 's how i like it .
i like you the way you are ,
this is so great you know ,
i don 't know . you can spend more time here . go to bu@@ tan .
okay , well you know what ?
monday .
are we going running ?
what i liked about it was how ... how big ,
it 's un@@ believable to me that you guys had lived through that .
yeah , everybody did .
but you think ,
yeah . how did you know that ?
there will come a time we all know .
now we must live ,
it 's autumn now , soon it will be winter ,
yes , so good .
clearly alice 's memory is falling , but she 's still incredibly resource@@ ful .
ii know you are discouraged .
alice .
yes , i 'm looking forward to it .
are you sure this is a good idea ? considering the state she 's in ,
but what ?
i don 't understand what you mean by " personal . "
you weren 't listening because that 's all there . that 's in the speech .
dun@@ no , then i won 't ask , then .
i can 't because i have done it already .
got it , totally , just practice more .
you can turn to it one more .
sorry .
all my life , i have accumulated memories ,
as you can imagine , or as you know ,
i know i 'm alive .
i rail against myself for not being able to remember things ,
struggling to be part of things , to stay connected to who i once was .
it 's really all i can do ,
it will go , i know it will . it may be gone by tomorrow ,
it 's the mayo clinic , start up next spring ,
everything i know is here ,
it 's just a two-@@ hour flight , we 'd see them as often as we do now .
hey mama . it 's anna , mom .
it 's ol .
how are you feeling ?
mr. student council president ,
why would you call me that ?
not to be hyper@@ bol@@ ic , but humans are a decade away
you are dressed like a character
so , i had a problem .
oh , and telling my dad .
by the time they pulled the pigs off him ,
animals don 't attack people for no reason .
run , jerry ! they do terrible things !
the box of hair products we pre-@@ shipped has arrived
hey ! that 's crazy talk .
my mom will be cool , but my dad is gonna fre@@ ak out .
your dad and i are buds .
and that means the coast guard
smell those side dishes .
you know what 's not a picnic ?
thanks , dad . i 'll take my chances .
oh , my god , he 's gonna kill everyone in the house .
listen to me .
you can never , ever tell him .
i mean , he pulls it out for everything .
you 're cold ? i 'll go get you a blanket !
pig in a blanket ?
all right , it 's time to fry this turkey .
you heard him .
you 're not the president of go@@ ggle lowering .
what could cam have done ?
i saw a list of clues in a magazine .
i think it 's sweet that you think
oh , i saw some champagne back there .
oh ! take the defi@@ br@@ ill@@ ator , i 'll call 9@@ 11 .
i watch a lot of " grey 's anatomy , "
jerry , no , jerry .
look at his basket . wasn 't much of a life .
i 'm feeling better , pr@@ it@@ ch@@ et@@ t . i think it was just gas .
oh , i deserve some of the blame .
the hell happened here ?
it 's possible i 've been electro@@ cu@@ ted one too many times .
i saw a man nearly die right in front of me .
it 's a lot to think about .
phil , get me a beer .
i learned something to@@ day@@ . too .
fruit roll-@@ ups , chips , chocolate milk ? u@@ gh .
i 'm packing you a lunch .
i thought it would be when i was in my 4@@ 0s .

kind of an intimidating character .
you knew it was me .
what are you tearing through ?
in english , your second language .
hey , i 'll bet you can help
give me a thr@@ ill . take a wh@@ ack at it .
i 'm sure you can figure out this clue .
what the hell ? !

breaking up these drug cartels
i 'm still checking the trajectory on that .
and that 's . .@@ - smart .
i 'll get .. i 'll get right back to you .
hi , sheriff . we need to talk .
you know , i heard about that .
okay . what 's that ?
everybody knows who you are .
that i can live with .
first of all , i 'm gonna tell you ..
you 're alive , aren 't you ?
i just don 't know how i can help you , mat@@ eo .
look , we thought they were dead .
and then he shot me
unless you were planning on going somewhere .
work with them .
well , uh ..
this guy stole $ 3 million from me .
and then you can just go on your merry way .
you gonna keep pointing that gun at me , partner ?
jet 's find out where it takes us
cole
sure . what are the numbers ?
people
now , what 's a drug lord like mat@@ eo
now , people ..
i 'm sure it 's just temporary .
i 'm in trouble here .
you 'll be fine . everything will be fine .
i know i shot other people , too . i just .. i just can 't remember !
shit .
what did you do with it ?
threw it in the trash
now , sir ..
show me where you threw the trash .
you know who sam 's old man is ?
jesus . what 'd you get yourself into ?
he wants me to find the guy and hand him over .
i 'm gonna find this son of a bitch and hand him over .
you and i have seen enough dead bodies of people
i just need a little time to get out from underneath this .
i 'll tell you what i 'm gonna do .
it was all about the money , huh , chris ?
now get me the fucking money !
you know , maybe we should just get married .
things work out , maybe i 'll even get you a boo@@ b job .
yeah , mike ?
ie 's a monster .
he raped me .. again and again .
you promised to help me get out of here .
drop your fuc@@ kin ' guns .
put it down , mother@@ fuc@@ ker !
did you miss me ?
you seriously fuc@@ ked up my day , son .
you dumb shit . we could have been partners on this .
well , next time you better kill me all the way .
don 't strain yourself .
or why you killed the kid !
all i care about is the god@@ damn money !
now where 's the rest ? !
now , where exactly did you put it ? !
with all this head@@ -@@ trauma shit , i can 't remember .
i think we found our guy .
it 's now in the parking garage at the streamline bus station .
yes , well , a liar 's word is worthless , even on paper .
and you wouldn 't be gone for two years .
well , they were from bed@@ ford and they didn 't have me aboard .
i will captain my own ship ..
up to them all we 'd ever have is a patch of dirt
he wanted things for his family , for himself .
dreamed of the sea and never got to sea with men like them .
it 's all i know .
please come back ... . promise me .
i promise .
to be a captain , you cannot be a friend , you are their superior .
thank you , son .
without us , without you , the world plun@@ ges into darkness .
that won@@ d@@ rous monster of a mighty length ;
o father , grant that your glorious light shine on these men ,
so , what month is this ?
which is why my friend bar@@ z@@ il@@ lai and i got a ber@@ th .
nice piece of work , mr. chase !
corn , mr. chase ?
that 's odd .
that 's right , he did .
corn , ok@@ ra , beans , i believe ? before he went to jail .
orphaned due to his father 's incarceration ?
that 's a motive to not ask too many questions .
you had nan@@ tuc@@ ket 's great seaf@@ aring family to adopt you .
no , sir , not for me .
no , sir , like i said , sometimes the fewer questions one asks , the better .
i always thought you were married anyway .
well , that 's her nose anyway .
there 'll be six men to a boat , first rules in the row , six bells sharp .
what 's your name ?
he 's the captain 's cousin , sir .
i don 't know who all of you are , or how you got here ,
and one thing only , and that is whale oil .
and even when the weather is fine and there are no whales , mr. coffin ,
you need to make up the time before we catch the east wind .
bel@@ ay that , set stun@@ s 's .
aye , sir .
sir , a squ@@ all on the star@@ board route , we need to shorten the sail immediately .
let it come , the men are soft from months on land , they
chase , we will stand on .
holding course , sir .
best prepare for weather , mr. bond , we 're headed into a squ@@ all .
stand down , mr. chase .
holding course , sir .
we need to cut those sails down !
no , the damage is done !
cap@@ iti@@ an cle@@ ment@@ e pel@@ ae@@ z , the santa maria .
same as always , george .
how far out ?
how far would that be ?
in offshore grounds .
more than you 've ever dream@@ t .
where is he ?
without a map , compass or quad@@ rant there 's no way to be certain .
this is what i wanted you to see .
waiting for a ship .
no ship is going to come .
how long do you think it would take to trust the birds
and to be able to prepare for it ..
or a chance to say good@@ b@@ yes , without a chance to make peace ...
but alas , at least those are settled between us
he told them the truth .
but the inquiry was a sham .
he ran a second ship ag@@ round off of hawaii ..
horrors that you remember
you 're supposed to take the form
freeing you to do what all k@@ ree must .
we 've given you a great gift .
i want to serve .
what was given can be taken away .
we 'll know soon enough .
serve well , and with honor .
and we get out , leaving them none the wis@@ er .
we are not to interfere with them ,
proceed with caution .
this is a dangerous mission .
for the good of all k@@ ree !
repeat .
no . this is a perfect spot for an ambush .
we can get past the locals .
too risky .
no , you won 't .
do you hear that , too ?
got it .
interesting .
go back right before this . go back .
this is it . now let me see where you 're headed .
did you call this in ?
excuse me , miss .
witness says she was dressed for laser tag .
i 'd like to ask you some questions .
could i see some identification , please ?
we don 't carry our identification on little cards .
you think i 'm one of those green things .
you are looking at 100 % red-@@ blo@@ o@@ ded earth man .
we talking cheek swa@@ b or urine sample ?
want my a@@ ol password ?
light-@@ speed engine ?
well , it 's still early .
well , i won 't tell your boss if you don 't tell mine .
the acc@@ users completed their operation ...
give us their location .
by bombing them out of the galaxy ?
a@@ unti@@ e carol ?
i knew it ! everyone said you were dead !
i 'm not really who you think i am .
green transforming aliens ? there 's no such thing .
there is no such thing .
okay , then let 's do this .
the person you most admire and respect , i 'd guess .
and what is your earliest memory of hal@@ a ?
blue blood running through my veins .
that 's my blood that 's cour@@ sing through her veins .
you 're too late .
for the good of all k@@ ree , commander ,
you know , you really shouldn 't have that thing on your lap .
and as long as he continues to fre@@ ak you out
can i ask you something ?
well , i have to see it first .
is this normal , like , space turbulence ?
locking in on coordinate grid .
it 's here . it 's gotta be here .
they got in her head . just like we thought .
you can see they 're not soldiers .
and the core ?
i made you the best version of yourself .
back here ! move , move !
let 's go ! go , move !
shel@@ don , we 've been through this .
afraid not . do you recognize this ?
indeed , the roommate agreement .
" number 37 : in the event one friend is ever invited
yeah . we also put in what happens
is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend ?
i mean , come on . what would you guys do if you were me ?
seriously ?
and i 'd leave him there .
uh , let 's see .
yeah , just think , " little boys , little boys . "
oh , hey . shel@@ don . we 're kind of in the middle of something .
shel@@ don , come home !
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
my piercing , blue eye .
fine .
not me not wanting one , not you having one with z@@ ack .
and if he brings it up , change the subject
but not the corn@@ hus@@ kers . do not discuss the corn@@ hus@@ kers .
never mind , you 're good .
hi . hey . slu@@ gger .
leonard .
ah , well , you know , i 've been taking vitamins .
can i get you something to drink ? maybe a beer ?
okay .
leonard wants to have a baby with my ex-@@ boyfriend z@@ ack .
uh , same words , just less angry .
it 's strange here , too , and we have a bak@@ ery for dogs .
i support my husband .
but , you know , if you think differently ,
yes .
not to bra@@ g , but i 'm an astronaut ,
please , i 'm , like , 90 pounds .
okay , i just need you guys to sign these waivers ,
is this a waiver or a screenplay you 've been working on ?
absolutely . it 's to protect us in case of injury .
done .
dressing rooms are in the back .
here you go .
if you don 't want to do this ,
looks like he does .
why not just be honest ?
i should be honest .
that was a long run .
you know , and then in a din@@ er
well , i took a nap next to hot dog on a stick .
i think you 're mad at me and leonard ,
have you seen any of these men ?
pull over up there .
but i thought you said
do you want some water ?
i don 't know where he is .
maybe you 'll get to be employee of the month .
there 's been a change in venue .
i finally get to talk to the brains of the outfit .
so you 're thinking public place , safety in numbers ,
get out@@ ta here sho@@ o fly
this is my house
he 's gonna get us out of here .
oh@@ . sorry to hear that .
i 'm sure something will come up before long .
here .
what 's this for ?
or it 's gonna be your funeral .
i don 't know how to reach him , i swear .
i 've had many foot-@@ wash@@ ers .
i am not trying to hurt you . i am trying to save you .
i 'm gonna die here .
not necessarily .
if a guard spoke to you , he was lying .
maybe you 've been too busy dying to notice ,
would you care
it 's from the gift ship .
now , if you 'll excuse us .
stay where you are .
oh , mighty nicolas cage tree ,
see ya .
we just started .
i take my pl@@ us-@@ one long sword ,
bye .
suddenly , a spectral shape
me , too .
sweet again , but i think that might be a little weird
i just wouldn 't forgive myself if i didn 't ask .
you will . you are the exact kind of woman
oh , hey , i 'm off on friday ,
if looks like rain for this weekend .
i think we have a little ...
it 's kind of been a while , hasn 't it ?
a cabin , the rain ..
it 's gonna be a good weekend .
hey , greg@@ g .
carlos sol@@ is was used to sitting in a position of power ,
or at the helm of a powerful company .
so .. what do you think of my new office ?
you 're lying to spare your daddy 's feelings .
" sp@@ ru@@ ce it up " ?
our budget is tiny , and every cent goes towards
all i 'm saying is , if i was an ad@@ dict ,
i 'll see you tonight .
you always take them .
well , thank goodness i have the most talented partner .
let 's get ham@@ mering .
i 've just seen too many cases
well , i just think our society 's gotten too soft .
you do realize you 're not on trial
tell me what 's going on , or i 'm walking out of this house .
i don 't believe this .
i 'm not going down this road again .
do you have any idea who that is ?
she 's dor@@ is ham@@ mond ,
bill ham@@ mond 's widow ?
why is she here ?
yeah , it 's great .
