i thought i could .
oh , so now you 're being thorough .
you have an idea who 's doing this ?
i want it sorted .
all right , well , i don 't want to spoil anything ,
do you mean it ?
well , amy , looks like the elevator
uh , he 's working with bert .
are you okay ?
it might be a head cold .
it do we ? do we really know them ?
they 're rule break@@ ers , amy .
complain about them to our spouse
what is this , the pur@@ ge ?
the city 's gonna make them rip out
what choice do i have ? these are the rules .
you know who doesn 't get permits for their dec@@ ks ? animals .
oh , really ? i have one word for you : bea@@ vers .
ge@@ ez .
hi ! welcome to the zone zone .
hey , i also have a joke for you .
well , how can i help you ?
interesting question .
but , on the other hand , so@@ crates says that
well , for me , it ends at 5 : 00 .
he 's going to have to remove it .
well , i don 't know if i 'd call you the good guys .
but i am pretty good at it .
okay .
what 's the story ?
i meant what 's the story medically ?
he is one of us and he 's hurt
the room key ?
i gave you the room key before we left the fre@@ akin ' room .
did you ?
you did this last week
i 'm sorry . i 'm so sorry .
i lost the key to our room .
it 's been a very long day .
are both very drunk .
that 's good .
you 've met her .
you 're gonna need to explain stuart .
got us on a group health plan ,
thought it was funny .
she got him one of these ...
if he was gonna die , she wanted him to at least see it .
doesn 't look like he 's gonna get on a bike again .
pickup .
the lawyer sent over the divorce papers .
let 's just ...
i 'm done thinking about it , cris@@ tina .
we should never have gotten married in the first place .
and for the last two years , all we have done
that ends .
we don 't hurt each other anymore .
that is what a great night in the e.@@ r. looks like .
let 's just get stupid drunk
i-i hate that you talk to him more than you talk to me .
you know what ? it 's probably fine .
penny ..
i 'm your son .
sure .
leonard , would it make you feel better to hear that
yeah . well , you should work on that .
yeah , the scientist .
i mean , he works with lasers and atomic magne@@ ts .
no , we did not set a date .
of course .
i 'm not .
actually , this is about where she and i are going to live .
well .. well , we might want to live together .
i 'm willing to let penny live with us
that 's very sweet .
i see .
well , yeah .
they just don 't appreciate you .
here , i made you some strawberry qu@@ ik .
what happened ?
i also mentioned that he and i could live together
i 'm sure he 's fine . he probably just
so , what are you guys doing ?
anyway , as i was saying ,
right you are .
so , mo@@ e , tell us a little bit about yourself .
ah , yes , she 's married to my father .
does this count for points ?
it 's like that .
then why did she even go out with you ?
and , you know ,
okay , so the reason that might sound crazy ...
look , howard , you 're in a relationship .
yes , but my compromises are about which bed@@ spread to buy
we both get our parents off our backs ,
i might never find another one who does .
i can 't believe your attitude .
yes , to other gay people !
oh , i don 't want a broken toy .
what ?
that was weird .
i cannot believe you guys aren 't gonna play with these .
relax . i 'm just looking at the box .
what is your problem ? !
which you probably did by shaking it !
leonard , i bought you this
you know , you 're right .
she comes home every day from school .
yes , brilli@@ antly .
she has no friends .
then one day , she spotted a young fisherman
now at first , this angered jur@@ ate ,
until , one day ,
i heard you were gonna be in my class .
look . my name is patrick .
okay , nothing .
he wasn 't saying the im@@ person@@ ation to be mean or anything .
nothing , why don 't you read first ?
surviving your fascist shop teacher ,
thank you , sir .
don 't worry , mr. anderson . i 'm okay .
i would happily not take shop ...
i have 13@@ 84 days to go .
if my parents ask me about it ,
i just hope i make a friend soon .
charlie , come on .
it 's an endless nightmare .
so , do you like football ?
maybe you know my brother , then .
you guys seem really happy together .
he 's not my boyfriend . he 's my step-@@ brother .
but she 's not bitter or anything . make no mistake .
you saw it . he 's never hit me before .
like aunt helen 's boy@@ friends ?
i can handle him .
please , don 't tell mom and dad .
holy shit . holy shit . they are ! they 're playing good music .
it 's not a sport , we all know it .
mary elizabeth , i think
bob , did you get him st@@ oned ?
how do you feel , charlie ?
sam ,
okay , charlie . let me make the mil@@ k@@ shake .
it 's like when you say
no . no , no , no .
so , he hated all that stuff .
where is michael tonight ?
i didn 't think anyone noticed me .
so , come on , everyone .
welcome to the island of mis@@ fit toys .
eight ? i have no idea .
i feel infinite .
for example , i am trying to participate
i completely agree .
am@@ d ist@@ ud wim@@ g ex tra books outside of class .
my favorite time , though , is lunch
it 's called punk rocky .
when he was a junior
because brad had to get drunk every time they fool@@ ed around .
when they finally did it ,
and saying that he was going to hell .
i asked patrick if he felt sad
you 'll be surprised to know
well , all the great writers used to wear great suits .
of course i did .
i don 't know what to say .
no , that 's okay .
i 'm in such a great mood ,
you are .
when i met you ,
you 're like a sexy english school boy .
he was my .
you know charlie
and even if i do , i can just shut it off .
and maybe if it does get bad again
especially sam .
i 'm gonna ask her out at new years .
how long does this take to work ?
did your older friends pressure you ?
i would never do drugs . never .
then if anything grows while you pose
i could put in a good word for you .
yeah .
the one where the girl asks the guy .
i mean it 's like , " hey , thanks for the crum@@ b . "
you wanna go with me ?
please come in .
a little closer together . that looks nice .
there you go . nice .
not really . how about you ?
it 's my first date , i don 't know what to compare it to .
i 'm sorry craig couldn 't come .
can 't say i blame him , really .
thanks , charlie .
like bil@@ lie holiday and foreign films .
yeah . my dad collects wine , but he doesn 't drink .
i guess .
mary elizabeth ,
sam ! sam !
what the hell is wrong with you ?
no , charlie . trust me . you don 't want to go back there .
i didn 't mean to do anything .
other guys .
but it 's best if you stay away for a while .
how long do you think ?
i am starting to get bad again .
we 're going to be late for easter mass .
thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven .
and forgive us our t@@ resp@@ asses
mary elizabeth ,
i just get so mess@@ ed up inside like i 'm not there or something
we 've all become such good friends ..
yeah . i mean i just don 't want to
stop embarrassing yourself .
are you gonna say something ?
you know why .
do you want your friends to know
where ? sch@@ en@@ ley park ?
i don 't know what kind of sick shit you 're trying to pull .
nothing .
say hi to your dad for me .
what did you just call me ?
hey , craig . sam will be down soon .
yeah , i 'll go put some pe@@ p in her step .
sure , patrick .
i 've been spending a lot of time with patrick .
he always says he feels free ,
then , sam got her letter from f@@ pen@@ n state .
patrick is going to the university of washington ,
it all feels very exciting .
especially because ever since i bl@@ acked out in the cafeteria ,
and i know it 's the last day ,
guys , guys , thank you for such a great year .
and i hope you have a great time this summer on your vac@@ ations .
charlie , very good .
last day .
so , i know it 's none of my business ,
well , my wife and i like it here .
you know , charlie , i was thinking that
really ?
sam and patrick left ,
she died getting my birthday present ,
she keeps driving away and dying over and over .
and i can 't stop her . i 'm crazy again
what g@@ har le cn@@ an le !
uh , what if the wizard casts
this is billy the kid we 're talking about .
what 's the deal with shel@@ don 's friend amy ?
well , i mean , she didn 't look through me
could you run it by shel@@ don if i could ask her out ?
stuart , settle an argument for us .
if i tell you that ,
mm ... make it two .
i 'll ring it up .
hey , can i talk to you about something ?
i know what this is about .
yes .
i 'm too small for twi@@ ster .
and sitting with my feet on the floor .
hey , you know , my mom smoked pot when she was pregnant with me ,
guys , something happened .
i think a boy likes me .
" we met at the comic book store .
" it 's okay if you say no .
just working it under all those layers of wool and polyester .
doesn 't he know you have a boyfriend ?
so do you like stuart ?
he 's nice .
okay , look , swee@@ tie , we all love shel@@ don ,
well , yeah , i guess they 're not engaged like me and ho@@ wi@@ e .
lot of options out there .
out .
the del@@ ux@@ e limited edition " wild west and wit@@ ches "
we just bought the regular pack .
yeah , it 's also a wand .
hey , do you see this ?
you got to be kidding me .
stuart , please . you 're being rude .
i believe i would like to alter the paradigm of our relationship .
with the understanding that nothing changes whatsoever ,
they 're gorgeous .
oh , look , the 's the future mrs. w@@ olo@@ witz .
with her head in the lap of .
yeah , and they can all move in with you and your mother .
i trusted you with my email address ,
don 't worry . they only stay on your record for a year .
come on , i touched one onion ring .
oh , honey , the buses don 't go where you live , do they ?
one of us , one of us .
you 're sitting in my spot .
leonard , she 's in my spot .
after you leave , i still have to live with him .
o@@ oh , strike three .
what the hell kind of cra@@ p is that ?
party with the pretty girls , dude !
you 're not going to party with them .
that 's what they said to neil arm@@ strong about the moon .
the entire nation dedicated a decade of effort and treasure
and a large number of people will believe it never happened .
and for our suddenly " back on the hindu wagon " ra@@ i ,
you forgot my barbec@@ ue bacon chees@@ e@@ burger ,
you 're ban@@ ished from the chees@@ ec@@ ake factory .
well , you have three strikes .
and three : i don 't like your attitude .
not only is it a violation of california state law ,
i bet we could sell that sign all over pas@@ ad@@ ena .
well , here 's the thing .
really ? well , that 's great .
well ?
no , no , no , no , no . it is on .
oh , penny , you don 't want to get into it with shel@@ don .
apologize . never .
look , wait , shel@@ don , this has gotten out of hand , okay ?
how about we just call it even and move on with our lives ?
look , you 've got to meet me halfway here .
i 'm willing to conce@@ de that you 've done stupid things .
that 's how dad does it .
guys , you need to grow up , learn to be independent ,
i just ruined my shirt
oh , cra@@ p !
do you know why i pulled you over ?
no . you didn 't come to a complete stop
i 'm sorry . i guess i was just really distracted .
i 'm gonna be late for my di@@ alysis appointment ,
and it explains why i look a lot more blo@@ ated than i do on my license .
confronting him will give you closure .
can 't i just confront him from the comfort of my own home ,
but i really wish you would .
why are you bringing evening wear ?
there 's gonna be a party .
you can 't make me go .
okay . i will .
that is my son .
i 'm not proud of what i did , but i didn 't want to lose you .
oh , keith .
he 's a wonderful little boy .
my whole childhood , my dad was in the army .
i always swore that i would never do that to my kid .
keith , you are not your father .
and you know what it really meant ?
i mean , it 's the only per@@ k to come out of this whole thing .
i spend six hours a day , three times a week
i think i just saw two cock@@ ro@@ aches throwing up .
didn 't they all die young of heart disease ?
sounds great , only make it a sco@@ op of cottage cheese
i run the school you used to attend .
no , no , forget it . forget the whole thing .
i just keep waiting for an answer to appear ,
look , you have to understand ,
that 's healing for me .
it 's enough for me , carlos .
hello ?
absolutely . i 'm all set .
yes .
oh , my god . you still don 't believe me .
i couldn 't tell my mother or anyone in my family .
look , i know i have been hard on you guys ,
well , maybe you should have a party .
i can wait all day .
it is true . that hate was always a part of me ,
that was the drugs making you think that way .
how about a movie ?
he 's your son .
no . that was a bad idea .
that 's true .
face it . one of these relationships
that 's because you 're young .
please ...
hi there . we 'd like a table , please .
um , do you think that you could squeeze us in ?
oh . um , it 's just ... we 're so slam@@ med .
let me see what i can do .
why is she getting a table before us ?
sir , she 's lost both of her kid@@ neys .
well , i 'm a diabetic , and my wife has rheum@@ at@@ oid arthritis .
mint jay@@ -le@@ ps are all the rage .
it 's just a fun thing .
yeah .
oh , i wouldn 't worry about it .
the guy 's a joke machine !
who ?
let 's get it moved !
very soon , my love .
the governor needs to pass .
how shall we picture the kingdom of god ?
he 's paraly@@ zed .
did you hear that ?
i thought only god could do that .
he knows . it is blasph@@ emy .
well , answer me
thomas , jesus has not come for the good ,
we should too .
blessed are the mee@@ k ,
fra@@ y to him , and he will listen .
i@@ ke this .
your kingdom come , your will be done ,
the law commands us to stone such a woman
to the first man who tells me
this cannot continue
he is leading us to something greater .
this is a dangerous man .
he has a big following in galil@@ ee .
galil@@ ee ?
nico@@ dem@@ us , don 't worry . nothing important ever came from galil@@ ee .
take the rope . lock it off .
it 's te@@ sus !
they 've come a long way . they 're hungry .
but how ? we have nothing
thank you , father , for what you bring us .
how much more will he give to you ?
put god first , and everything else will follow .
you can lead us like an army . we 're strong enough to beat the romans .
messi@@ ah ! messi@@ ah !
it has been revealed to you by god .
tomorrow i will meet you on the other shore .
surely a messi@@ ah wouldn 't leave us like this .
so tell me what the way of the messi@@ ah is .
the son of god
mal@@ chus .
it 's another protest , high fri@@ est .
get the master back to his residence quick as you can .
the people are furious that the romans used the temple funds to build it .
on a donkey .
and riding on a donkey . "
e must not interfere with pas@@ sover .
he 's going into the temple .
change your money here !
exchange here ! don 't like the look of this .
there will be no pas@@ sover .
i will crush any rebellion .
what are you preparing , mary ?
just to talk
jud@@ as , you are his friend .
they say you can perform miracles ,
but you must be born again .
but i will always be with you .
that one of you here ..
father , take this from me .
lord , i know you are pleased with me ..
come on , mary .
keep him moving
you cannot go through with this . it is not legal
pil@@ ate will close the temple .
but what if he really is who they say he is ?
god demands we obey the law .
anyone who shows contempt for the judge or for the priest
brothers .
you know i would not have asked you ...
what has happened ? where is my son ?
arrested ?
they want to keep it secret .
are you the son of god ?
and you will see me coming ..
this is re@@ pul@@ sive !
so ? execute him .
this is a tense time .
he claims to be our king .
well , babies do that .
it seems they couldn 't handle some constructive criticism .
actually . i 've been looking forward to staying with you .
because he 's her son ?
no knock ? what 's the frac@@ as ?
ask any guy in high school .
check ' yes ' or ' no . "
really ?
well , you tell him i said , " who are you ? "
don 't worry , we 're cool .
i get it . you have high standards .
well , we 'll just have to come up with an excuse .
it 'll work . i 've used this to get out of eight jobs ,
she 's so sick , she can 't even stand up .
we have to go right to the emergency room .
it might be super gon@@ or@@ rhea . bye .
and on the night they were finally gonna do it .
and the coffee 's already working ,
give me that . let 's see if i can do math too .
16 times 12 .
you enjoy , i 'll pre@@ heat the oven .
there , that 's the coffee talking .
this is why they tell teen turtles
well , we 're mostly just sending pictures
and what 's this ?
he 's the one who broke up with me .
maybe you two are like chris brown and ri@@ hanna ,
i thought you guys were good together .
but then he kind of got fed up
he felt like he had to pull away for his own well-being .
but i 'm chris brown .
how 's that stove ?
'@@ cause i needed help making 1,000 cup@@ cakes in four hours .
one might .
and , andy ,
now , get the cup@@ cakes out before they burn .
ah , there 's the girl i broke up with .
i 've had my hands in more boxes tonight
how come i never get a new dr@@ yer ?
that is not an f-@@ word i have heard him use .
shouldn 't you be playing " words with friends "
of course he is . that 's not sad . what ?
it 's for soccer .
right .
say , listen , your dad and i were just talking
whatever you want because we love you very much .
what does " sy@@ zy@@ gy " even mean ?
hey , everybody , you remember my sister , p@@ am .
okay , i heard that one .
oh , look who 's a che@@ ater .
i have trouble sm@@ elling lem@@ ons .
but i 'll tell you what i can hear loud and clear .
oh , come on , dad ,
she 's the self-@@ appointed sensitivity expert .
i will not let it go .
no sug@@ ar-@@ coating .
claire , you have the floor .
okay , well , why don 't you give me an example
all right
okay . the singer or pepper 's dog ?
and when i was leaving ,
i 'm glad you had that experience ?
i love that song .
well , this was fun . who 's hungry ?
okay , anyone else ?
you 're the boy who cried " divine . "
you know , and half the people around here
okay ? and , yeah . about mine ?
are you show@@ ering like we discussed ?
u@@ h-@@ huh .
i 'm sorry for ru@@ ining your friday night .
i 'm telling you right now , i 've been to home@@ brew .
i 'm not one of those people .
steve , could you do me a favor , could you just please
you know if we 're gonna do this thing
that 's interesting .
you think that 's the first stop that we made ?
oh , well , then you already have a retailer .
look , paul . my middle name 's paul
i think we 're kind@@ red spirits here .
and my gut tells me to give you this opportunity .
$ 400 for a hundred units , a third up front .
okay . i 'll pay $ 450 per machine . $ 450 .
but it 's a big pa@@ yo@@ ff if you deliver .
all right . you got 90 days .
no , no . i 'm glad you asked .
maybe get you boys a fan when it gets hot .
what do you think ?
yes . it is . this is perfect .
oh , this is my friend daniel ko@@ tt@@ ke .
ko@@ tt@@ ke ? ko@@ tt@@ ke from india ,
we 'll be launching the apple ll in about a month .
gentlemen , is there some place we can talk ?
look , steve . i 'm willing to take the risk .
but risk disguised as promise .
tells me you 're on to something big .
i think we should start with around 90 grand
i 'm sorry .
oh , wh@@ oa , wh@@ oa . wait . steve , one second .
oh , no , no .
i just don 't think it gets it done for you .
it 's social currency .
and if we want to stay there , we gotta risk everything
on the command bar ?
there 's over 20 different functions
we got to make the small things just un@@ forget@@ table
you get a drop-@@ down menu , and then there 's preferences ,
now , which tab do i click on to get different font styles ?
that 's actually something that i wanted to talk to you about , steve , is .
but everything we 're talking about is conceptual .
it 's not my job to be nice to people .
they don 't deserve it .
do you know how this company works ?
i 'd be happy to teach you , if you want to know .
why i left the safety of hp for this ?
i left because this was my thing
and of all the guys i knew , you were the cool@@ est .
and this was my chance to do what i loved .
thai 's all , that 's all i ever wanted
no . no , you 're not .
on wall street the tech titan apple
it was the most over .
yeah . yeah . oh , terrific .
hey , pal .
business as usual , guys .
thank you . i had some fun ideas .
i 'm gonna get out of here .
hi . could you please tell mr. mark@@ k@@ ula we 're here . thank you .
gentlemen .
there 's something we need to talk about ,
he 's hemor@@ rh@@ aging the company 's dollar
mike , i love everything steve represents . you know that .
yeah . but , it 's his candy store .
mike , it 's a problem .
" congratulations on your first personal computer . "
then do something about it !
three years ago ibm had no interest in the personal computer
and i 'm sorry , but the board is unanimous .
for 18 months now you 've offered nothing but support
but you have to try to look at it
he 's great . yeah , he 's great .
they 're looking at losses in the millions
that 's right . the shareholders don 't see past their own shadows .
the way your employees see you .
it 's mine .
you 're letting them take it away from me .
now that doesn 't make any sense .
i 'd rather have a judge give me the works than have to do it myself .
so what ?
you can 't get away with it .
team ? i don 't .
well , obviously ease of use is a big feature here .
but , we 're kind of struggling with the interface , and , to be frank .
shit . yeah .
we 're gonna run the 68@@ 000 .
that 's correct . dude .
done
chris , it has been a .
you 're working on the mac@@ into@@ sh ? yeah .
the mac@@ into@@ sh is not even a toy . it 's a joke .
and so should we .
gentlemen , i believe it 's time to reconsider
what would you have me say , arthur ?
don 't put that on me .
you over-@@ hy@@ ped the mac .
and as a result we lost two years of sales .
well , it sure as shit is somebody 's fault .
you 're stripping me of my resources ,
because it sells .
you guys must be pretty desperate .
how are things going with the newton ?
it 's not as bad as you think .
apple stock just set another record low .
i 'd say that 's pretty bad .
steve , what do you need ?
come on , i 'll show you around .
we 're not gonna ask for permission .
and while i commend his actions , and his initiatives ,
we need to 90 back to who we are , and what we do best ,
we 're gonna build a new line of computers
and we 're gonna kill every other project
we 're also gonna double down on the advertising budget .
just like back in the old days .
but i will not be able to move forward
apple is like a ship with a hole in the bottom ,
so why don 't you let me do my job ?
those in favor ?
who 's that woman ?
oh . is everything all right ?
i think we should check out hudson 's market .
we need cil@@ an@@ tro , don 't we ? come on .
well , i wanted to get you a t-@@ shirt that said ,
when i go home , and i 'm in tears and carlos asks me why ,
carlos gave $ 50,000 to one of your neighbors .
a mike del@@ fin@@ o .
oh , my god . mike 's wife is one of my closest friends ,
there was just something so odd about that .. encounter .
ma@@ v@@ be that 's because i 'm not his friend .
my manager said i could take a break early .
i pol@@ itely declined his offer .
not until a few months ago ,
well , it 's just , my cup@@ boards are clut@@ tered ,
thanks .
i want to show you something .
i mean , didn 't mike just have his truck re@@ possessed ?
he got a big cash infusion .
he loves me .
so eddie attacked our son ?
he comes from an abusive home .
so i have to wonder if he 's gonna punch me
how about therapy ? that might help .
okay , here 's a thought .
we 'll try the therapy .
i guess my instinc@@ ts about sam were right , wouldn 't you say ?
something . i wasn 't listening .
okay , i 'll stop . i know you 're upset .
when sam first showed up ,
but this has forced me to remember
i had to sit in a trailer and do my homework with mit@@ tens on
i 'm ....
do me a favor . don 't let on that you know how much it cost .
he thinks it 's o@@ st@@ ent@@ ati@@ ous , and he 's a little embarrassed .
hey , guys . sorry i 'm late .
we 're gonna check on dinner .
oh , god , don 't worry about it . we didn 't buy it .
wow . without even blin@@ king .
oh , carlos will do it .
i think carlos is having an affair .
because he 's been acting really secre@@ tive lately .
well , i 'm sure there 's a good explanation .
it 's just .. why are you calling over here all the time ?
susan , say something .
confess what ? !
you son of a bitch !
all i did was help a friend who scre@@ wed me over
that happened to you ?
they drew it so the testi@@ cles were my eyes .
so go apologize .
you started it , we just piled on .
z@@ ack , i 'm sorry you 're stupid .
come on . we 're trying to win a contest here .
penny , there 's no " i " in " justice league . "
kind of embarrassing me in front of my friends .
i changed my mind . i 'm not going .
it 's best you learn that now before you get the wrong idea . okay ?
we couldn 't save one don@@ ut ? not one don@@ ut ?
don 't you dare . don 't you fucking dare !
come on , man ! for the love of shit !
you know what ? last weekend , i grabbed ka@@ thy mur@@ ch 's th@@ igh .
okay , number one , i don 't even know what that means .
man , stop judging people .
i kind of do .
can i come with you ? we can take my dad 's kia .
shut up . milan pin@@ ache ? that 's huge .
yeah , you better jimmy up .
how ? i fired the dead weight and brought in cheap zom@@ bie labor .
out of the 25 boys seated here today
i 'm going to my room .
why do you think he left the room ? it 's because he doesn 't want to talk .
ned , listen , i know that at times it seems like it 's awkward between you and i .
you don 't mean that .
yeah . i do . i really do .
look , right now i need you down at the lot .
what about my dreams ?
uh , well , for starters , i want to be an engineer someday .

we give the alien what they came for .
why would they pick d@@ ill@@ ford ? what 's the one thing our town 's known for ?
hey , hey . everybody !
mr. zim@@ mer@@ man , your daughter , she 's a vampire , right ? and you love her ?
mrs. franklin , your son is a zom@@ bie .
all the aliens want
only 30 re@@ als .
good morning .
nothing , thank you . do you have a room free ?
very well .
won 't you have something meanwhile ?
and the t@@ x@@ ak@@ oli is very good .
may i ask what brings you to our town ?
pat@@ xi ? the black@@ smith ?
he 's an animal . and he 's dangerous . he 's so fierce they call him the hammer .
i just need to go in there to carry out a search .
i 'm sorry , that 's confidential .
i 've come ahead to start work on the investigation .
look , it 's bad enough that they raise our taxes .
but you 're always following after her .
mind your manners .
let us proceed to the eu@@ char@@ ist . let us drink the blood of the lord .
there .
don 't be che@@ e@@ ky , mati@@ l@@ de . behave like a young lady .
are you crying again ?
come i@@ fo@@ w , i didn 't mean that .
what ? are you going to cry ?
shut up !
at times , there are horrible scre@@ ams , too , that chill your blood .
others say that it 's the devil ,
no , it 's nothing . we were just saying how ele@@ gan@@ tly you 're dressed .
go in and search the place until you find something suspicious .
'd just be in the way . i 'm no good at field work .
there 's a chain .
okay , like we said . let 's go .
but i want you to know that i 'm always here for you .
suicide is a mortal sin . you know that .
but if that person wasn 't bad , is there no way to come back ?
but ?
i 'll take you to the vatican
yes ! you get me out of here ,
he took her to hell .
what ? now you want to go ?
the other demon took the little girl .
but that 's not my problem .
you owe it to her .
all right ! but you 'll go as my prisoner .
wait . you can 't go with a stupid hand bell .
the car@@ list gold !
san@@ ti , there 's the gold . this is our chance .
you look terrible .
no , no .... a difficult soul .
he doesn 't look so tough .
stay where you are !
if i 'm facilitating escapes , we can 't have surprises .
don 't act like you 're suddenly a fan of the status quo , okay ?
that 's why you had to bust your brother out in the first place .
working on a new plan ?
just get tired of looking at empty skin .
but maybe it 's a way to get back to the states real fast .
you actually think i want to help you ?
$ 100@@ k ?
difference is this time , you 're not alone .
what they call ' em again ?
not sure what 's in them .
yo , be happy you 're not eating sn@@ ails .
do you think they noticed ?
guys .
i got a warehouse in new york . you 're coming to me ?
killing you might be a lot more satisfying .
we can be pretty sure he 's coming back to ith@@ aca .
why would he come back here ..
of course .
he had a life before he worked for me ,
and when he went away , i ended up looking after them .
he wants to kill me .
i 'll be the bait if i have to .
he 's not just gonna stro@@ ll in here .
that 's why we got someone even more clever .
guy 's a pencil neck .
so you , in turn , can be the hammer .
he rou@@ ted the image through a server
encrypted in the arabic , the images are all sorts of stuff .
visiting hours for zo@@ os ,
he 's probably thinking if anyone sees this ,
this is making my head spin .
and that 's what i 'm doing .
because i 've got him so far off his game now ,
" but in return , you must take a life . "
wait . chicago ? i thought i was going with you .

and i 'm gonna talk to her .
feel better .
no , no , her verte@@ bral bodies are too large .
let 's move .
i mean , i don 't know what it means .
i mean , i guess what i 'm asking is ,
we 're not .. we 're not kissing ,
my marriage is collap@@ sing ,
ask her what she thinks about it .
if i want a reaction , i should just force one .
i 'm saying stop talking to me !
hey , are we ready ?

i think she 's got an ink@@ any@@ amba egg .

we can use the pile rods from the drill rig and wire them together .
yes , and right now we 've got 13 minutes .
i can try .
send them to the river and bring them back on my signal .
the memory of that moment was ruined the very next day .
because if 's mine .
no , no , no . my sons made that for me for valentine 's day !
it 's still got the price tag on it . look .
you listen to me , keep your br@@ ats off my property .
most mothers will also tell you
.... and some brought home candy and flowers ..
.... others managed to forget about the day entirely ... again .
they were busy learning a secret about their neighbors .
so paul said that z@@ ach@@ ary killed d@@ ana ?
well , it must have been an accident .
could you hold her ?
this is the secret that mary alice was trying to protect .
you know , i never thought i 'd say this ,
we 're using our best china
yes . you know , that 's one of things
i 've put them in an imaginary box
there 'll be a lot of forced smiles
i do want to forgive him , dr. gold@@ fine .
really ?
they wrote a note .
they should come over and apologize in person .
you let those boys run wild .
it 's a disgrace .
it has nothing to do with my mother .
it 's a per@@ version .
what do you want me to say ?
i dreamed about things i wanted , and i got them all .
so this is just a bl@@ ip on the radar for me .
and if i did it once , i can do it again .
even when it looks like i am .
yeah , i was cleaning my automatic
i know it sounds crazy , i just .
but i heard what you said at the restaurant .
we don 't have to talk about that right now .
i just want to be with you above everything else .
i may be stupid enough to shoot myself ,
yeah .
no . i 'll just wait out here .
you boys want some peanut brit@@ tle ?
don 't get any crum@@ bs on my floor . move over .
i 'm si@@ ra . who are you ?
what are you doing here ?
i saw a man last night .
i don 't know .
why ever not ?
how do you know there 's only one wish ?
it 's a long way to go to find out .
it 's already been a long way .
oh , it 's just me .
they 're waiting back home with a big surprise party .
no , i told them they could have you tomorrow night .
ges@@ und@@ he@@ it . you okay ?
come on , let 's go home
you know , i am very disappointed
yes , it 's just that in all the years i 've known him ,
you 're un@@ believable .
if i run too deep a bath , i dro@@ wn .
how about dar@@ ts ?
dar@@ ts is a bar game .
hey , you 're harold jones , right ?
i loved your piece on the failure of derivative markets .
i look forward to seeing you around .
from me and all the readers .
why not ?
mail@@ room guys are meant to be seen and not heard .
we 're not on their level . we 're little people .
i am not ! dude , listen . i am just respectful of their work@@ space .
i 'll let you know as soon as i 've made a decision , nigel .
to explore bermuda and the smaller islands around it .
i 'm a. bo@@ at@@ .@@ man .
because i have to be honest , it was hard to find someone to do this .
that 's okay with you , right ?
it 's not a big story , but it 's a start .
everything i need to know is in here ?
and there 's a boat waiting for you .
that 's me !
that was close .
i don 't know about this , hank .
all this bermuda triangle talk is just to sell t-@@ shirts to tourists .
mr. popularity .
i just realized why i felt like your writing came straight ..
sergeant pe@@ a@@ cock , what 's it doing ?
good .
hey , lem@@ uel ! it 's darcy . i 've totally forgiven you .
great .
for you .
it 's like he had no feelings at all .
what 's with all the smiling ?
that gr@@ in .
i didn 't smile .
you did the same thing when you told him his ham@@ ster died .
yeah . he probably just needs time to process it .
yeah , honey .
we all manage it differently .
others ..
thank you .
hey , so since i 'm already here ,
yeah
what if i get a chap@@ er@@ one that my parents approve of ?
well , i guess so .
do you mind if he stays here for the party ?
i don 't suppose you 've thought of a chap@@ er@@ one ?
okay , you 're not hearing yourself .
hello ? hey , dad . it 's me .
i 'm sick .
yeah . yeah , 6 : 00 . we 're really looking forward to it .
i don 't know . let me ask .
um , uh , red .
okay . yeah , cam says red .
every time i try to do something nice ,
i 'm gonna chalk this up to jet lag
it 's my partner 's father .
did you know walt had a daughter
can you imagine ?
i told you , i would do everything possible
i wish he would 've said two things .
i bet you guys had some really good times
you know , luke ,
well , i mean , you guys liked to garden .
swee@@ tie , how are you feeling ?
confused ? frustrated ?
before we get to dessert , i 've got some presents here .
love it !
look at this . oh . so elegant , huh ?
i think i might cry .
dad , i really gotta get home .
but you can 't expect me to see a sign that says ,
i just wanted a special day with my daughter ,
i 'm a week past my due date as it is .
just put the tv in the den . let 's get out of here .
it goes right here .
sometimes i 'd wake up in the middle of the night
yeah . that 's ...
is that any better ?
oh ! oh , my god . okay , no , no , no .
oh , hey , doc .
can i get you guys anything else ?
dad , why are you acting like this ?
i want to be eu@@ gene cer@@ nan .
" apollo 17 " astronaut ,
she was getting on board .
she has to be in day care .
that 's what you do . and then she cries .
mm . what she said .
thank god . it looks boring .
yeah , they 're closing the e.@@ r. and streamlining the place .
you 're crazy . it 's not that bad .
look at this .
the end is coming .
with these new o.@@ r. procedures ,
closing the e.@@ r. should cut down on time .
how 's hunt feel about that ?
oh , it 's happening .
is he gonna leave town ?
when did it make this all about you .
derek has a plan .
he spent the night with ke@@ p@@ ner .
oh , they ' re gonna be mad about the ted conference .
do we have a reply yet ?
that was the subject line ?
well , would you open an email that said " proposed budget cuts " ?
no . we 're just gonna have to pitch it in person .
it 's hard to say no to someone 's face .
everything will be scanned ...
the last five hospitals whose efficiency she improved
well , i 'm safe because they can 't fire the pregnant lady .
uh , dr. nes@@ bau@@ m , you can take it from here .
good morning , everybody .
you sure the kid didn 't eat her ?
she 's angry . she 's 13 and she had a double hip replacement .
she 's mean .
she 's three days post-@@ op now . okay ?
we just have to make her do it for her own good .
can 't even put a todd@@ ler in ti@@ ghts .
that 's how a bad cop does it .
yeah , and i told them to get lost .
the e.@@ r. is open for one more day .
i know you don 't want it to ,
we are on a tight schedule with the renovation .
yeah , well , you 're gonna need to let that go .
i 'd just like to hear you name one thing
not everybody shares that passion .
okay , so you do the talking ,
hunt needs me in the o.@@ r .
no . p-@@ people don 't like me .
you can do this .
a technique i have developed through years
gross .
over the years , i 've developed my own technique
i 'm sure it 's lovely , but the point here
i suppose .
type and cross for six units .
hey , what 's your buddy 's name ?
does he have any aller@@ gies that you know of ?
i-@@ i-i don 't know .
we 're doing everything we can .
on it .
oh , god .
okay , stop .
we could use blood .
very funny .
there are protocols in place for people who won 't
joy , get my head@@ lamp ready .
wait a minute . wait a minute .
we 're trying to keep blood loss to a minimum .
so i hear somebody 's nose came off ?
almost . take a look .
and what should 've sha@@ ved off half a second
gau@@ ze , please .
all right , a@@ very . that 's enough .
i mean , i feel like i 'm working the dinner shift
i mean , that 's essentially what she 's asking us to be .
you can tell dr. pan@@ t@@ suit hasn 't been in one in years .
well ...
so just give me a shout when you 're done .
doctors .
i thought i was gonna be fired .
oh , it 's fine .
my people just care about this place .
i know you 're all upset , especially you ,
so if you need to blame me instead of thank me ,
the muscles around your new hips will atro@@ phy ,
because i 'm your doctor
if you went through all of that training
how badly you want something ,
feel that ?
yes !
okay , all right , people often ask me
oh , there 's red@@ mond .
i saw your little ho@@ wi@@ e today
ah , thanks . yeah , he 's a kick .
yeah , we 're not quite there yet .
oh , because the baby kicked .
jer@@ k
maybe my baby 's kicking because it wants a gran@@ ola bar .
you want to stop right there
he has eyes .
rich is circling the drain ,
yeah , i know . and they 're praying . awesome .
you think that because you 've been here all of ,
jeff .
save it . your side@@ kick already made the pitch .
oh , come on .
it 's not about the talks . it 's about the networking .
this is what 's good for the hospital .
the patients especially . mm .
your parking space .
uh , it 's not even an advantage .
i don 't want to swap . i want ' em both .
but this method will no longer be performed
because we 're co@@ gs in an assembly line ,
and how good can that care be
with that kind of volume , who in the hell knows ?
you 're missing the point . the patients don 't matter .
mm . i didn 't ...
to just up and move at my age ..
in a few months , you won 't recognize this street .
what do you mean , it 's gonna change ?
all you need to know is that i 'm helping you .
don 't worry . it 's done .
oh , i promise you 're gonna have a great .. time .
as it happens , i need some good legal advice .
well , yeah . free is good .
you mean carmen .
half of carlos ' family scaled a fence at some point .
i am just saying .
you know ,
please don 't put it on the table .
well , the restaurant is pretty , uh ..
shall we ?
okay .
i thought you were pizza .
i don 't know . let 's see .
b@@ ree could see that i 'm a little down .
it 's not like i had anything special planned .
paul can 't open a halfway house on this street
he only gets one vote . no way he gets a majority .
does this seem too easy ? :
hey , what about the gay ?
okay . how about i just refresh everyone 's coffee ?
oh , can you be a love and bring back more of these cookies ?
bob ? roy ?
that 's ridiculous !
fine ! i 'll talk you up .
if we need someone to intimidate paul ,
why ?
you are such a brave little girl .
what are you talking about ?
the men who took daddy ?
mama !
no , mama ! i want to stay with you !
this is lovely , keith .
what is it ? oh , i know .
oh , i 'm sorry . i know we 've been having a lot of din@@ ners
it 's really sweet the way you 've been looking after him .
me , too . mm .
wanna grab me a drink :
oh , yes , of course . would you like the ring delivered
i 'm too nervous to wait for dessert .
we have the jum@@ bo shrimp cocktail .
isn 't that refreshing ?
i think we should cut all funding to the military
so shall we order ?
" shall we order ? "
i admit , she was much nic@@ er when she was fat .
you think that 's what i was crying about ?
yes .
yeah . but we have to be very discre@@ et ,
do we really have to talk about this ?
it was over 20 years ago .
the way he made me feel ..
he was the one ...
listen ...
i mean , mike and i had our share of setbacks .
i never stopped dreaming that maybe one day ...
they do not .
susan wishes mike had your sense of humor .
then why do you sound annoyed by that ?
i 'm the one who can 't wait to get away from her kids
for almost 20 years ,
you know , i 'm the one
and whose heart is so big ,
but now i know why you showed me your bo@@ oms .
how does sleeping on the couch sound ?
thank you for taking care of mine .
hey , everybody quiet down . this shouldn 't take too long .
that is scheduled to open in the property
all those opposed to the halfway house ?
according to our by@@ laws ,
yeah , that 'll be 14 to 1 .
you might wanna check your math . i have at least seven votes .
with the acquisition of mr. s@@ cul@@ ly 's place ,
i used the settlement i got from my wrongful incarceration
he was my real@@ tor .
he just hired me . i didn 't know he was evil .
not that much .
you never told us about that .
well , none of this matters .
wow .
see you in show business !
good luck on blood@@ way , lun@@ a !
and i 'm cle@@ o de nile , of the de n@@ iles .
you bet
i heard the pt@@ ol@@ em@@ ys are hosting that gala tomorrow night .
wo@@ ah !
wo@@ ah@@ -@@ ho@@ -@@ ho ! boo york is so exciting !
it 's overwhelming . it 's giving me ideas !
i haven 't been able to write new songs .
if you can 't find it in boo york , it doesn 't exist !
do you know how to get to pt@@ ol@@ emy tower ? we 're in a hurry .
at this time of day ? e@@ ek ! you 're crazy . sco@@ o@@ ch !
you know a lot about boo york .
my family helped build this crazy ma@@ ze of a city .
and its power would make the couple 's promise permanent .
do you see all of this ?
it could be ours . it will be ours !
but daddy ! i don 't wanna be with that se@@ th kid .
just think about all the power you will have
what if there were another way ?
cle@@ o is an egyptian princess ,
yeah , you 're right .
then she can move on with her life .
if you love her , you 'll leave her .
the comet will crash into boo york city at midnight !
something about you looks different . no , don 't tell me ... hair cut ?
but hey , technically i am now a working actor in boo york city !
you 're h@@ acking into satellite system to investigate ? very clever !
elle ? elle ! are you okay ? what 's happening ?
i 'm not sure .
comet does not seem to slow down ! gh@@ ou@@ lia , what else can we do ?
look ! it 's pharaoh !
okay , everyone , let 's try to stay nice and orderly ...
hi ! i 'm cat@@ ty no@@ ir .
come on !
you 're crazy !
come on ! you can get to anywhere you want in the city from up here .
oh , good , you 're here !
burnt si@@ en@@ na or terri@@ fying haunted forest green ?
ca@@ sta and the spells ?
where 're we going ?
i can 't remember the last time i got to
no , and my family can 't stand it .
all i hear is city noise .
i hear music !
cle@@ o ! what are you doing ? why aren 't you dressed for the gala ?
you 've found your voice . why would you give that up ?
they offered me fame , money .
think about what i said . goodbye , pharaoh .
i 've waited for this moment forever !
very good . that 's the kind of music we want to hear this evening .
yes , mother .
of course , daddy . i 've got cle@@ o exactly where i want her .
and tonight , she visits us once more .
a mysterious race of beings who live beyond the stars .
a message ? a peace offering ? a warning ?
and so we created the promise ceremony ,
but we have something to remind us
amazing !
on behalf of the pt@@ ol@@ emy family ,
and to what i assume
you 're saying de@@ u@@ ce just broke up with cle@@ o for no reason ?
something doesn 't seem right ...
what about him ?
but if you haven 't heard , i won 't worry you about it
you 'd be rich . you 'd be powerful .
everybody wants me to do this ?
i mean , you 've already got de@@ u@@ ce and .
whatever , forget i said anything ,
i know , it 's not " acting " acting ,
aw . thanks .
pharaoh , had feelings for each other
your attention ! your attention , please .
the promise ceremony will proceed as scheduled .
yes , mother .
get rid of this !
you 're right ! dude , thanks for the talk .
u@@ h-@@ huh . hey , kid , you gonna pay for that ha@@ unt dog or what ?
i saw ne@@ fer@@ a give something to tor@@ al@@ ei .
their voices must be somehow trapped inside .
no , she has the singing voices of two of the most talented singers ever !
the bright lights of blood@@ way .
you got it !
you bet she is .
not if she 's starring in my next blood@@ way hit , the book of gor@@ gon .
back off ! she 's my new client !
can i get your auto@@ graph ?
and we found cat@@ ty 's voice .
then we have to get back to the museum
pick a cab , any cab .
this is a clean house .
there 's no rush .
will you fetch the mill@@ ers ' luggage ?
absolutely .
how long will it take ?
we do it in three stages .
you see , your immune system produces too many bad immuno@@ glob@@ ul@@ in ...
you really know your stuff .
rose and paul , you 'll be on this floor ,
unfortunately , our patients must be in their own rooms for treatment .
see you later , hou@@ din@@ i .
you can 't wander this place by yourself .
where did she go ?
dear lord ...
and for this time that we get to spend together as a family .
in jesus ' name , amen .
something on your mind , honey ?
i said i was sorry , but he needs to put that drip back in his hand .
well , you should 've told someone . people thought you were dead .
well , that 's sort of what i wanted them to think .
good@@ .@@ yeah , okay . so give her some room .
yes , they are .
sure .
oh , i so did not need to know that .
down to the j@@ ail@@ house to talk to mike .
yeah . but somebody 's gotta tell him about his new lawyer .
um , yeah , about that ...
he 's not crazy about me spending time with my ex .
i remember , and i guess that 's enough for him .
well , i , uh , can 't say that i blame him .
if you were home once in a while . you 're the one she list@@ ens to .
i know , l know . i know .
i don 't want you to be afraid to take a firm hand with kay@@ la .
you know what that means .
i should treat her as badly as i treat my own children .
sorry . um ..
what 's to explain ?
do you know how many girls never get flowers ?
she locked me in here !
this is totally her fault .
well ... that 's a fresh approach .
it 's the truth .
okay , mrs . mc@@ cl@@ us@@ key 's downstairs , and we will be right across the street if you need us .
can you do that for me ?
but i 'm never gonna love her ..
so alma 's alive . big deal .
susan , please . we look stupid enough for suspec@@ ting him .
it may be a little late for that .
we have some questions about that jane doe we showed you in the mor@@ gue .
well , you were having an affair with her when she died .
susan ?
uh , i 'm happy to answer any questions that you might have .
enjoy the dessert .
you called the police ?
they needed to know that that dead woman was or@@ son 's mistress .
and she was finding it delicious .
we sense their isolation ...
telling ourselves there 's nothing we can do to help ...
but this is spiritual blackmail !
i do what it takes to get the job done .
but we found this orphan@@ age that had lots of older kids .
she 's 10 years old .
well , i talked to reverend sy@@ kes yesterday ,
you know , growing ud , i didn 't really have a lot of friends .
but i was never hated .
aw . so , sweetheart ,
well , we 're hoping to find a donor very soon .
i wonder who it 'll be .
i can 't believe this .
of course , she wants to .
mor@@ ty and i are about to take a cruise ...
mommy 's mad because we played with her doll .
your doll ?
it 's ... a gift for bob and lee .
let me get your discharge papers ,
i will , uh , get your bag .
but if i was and i didn 't check ,
you know ...
and then i see
julie couldn 't wait to hand over one of her kid@@ neys .
i wasn 't a match .
you only had a 15 % chance of being a match .
aren 't we lucky we already know those things ?
yes . i 'll be right down .
i 'll call you later .
yeah . i 'm not driving losers in my car .
here you go , ladies .
well , you have been through so much ,
cheese pu@@ ff , anyone ?
married to paul young ?
hello .
you 're sure this is okay ? it isn 't gonna be awkward ?
why is it our responsibility to make her feel loved ?
but let 's talk about the last woman
we 're back .
oh . lovely .
we 'll pour you some vin@@ o .
well , i-i care what they think .
and i want them to accept me .
no , it 's not that . i just ..
right now
oh , fuck no
i don 't know . uh , you draw a card .
i know . i know . it 's stupid .
why , exactly ?
ah . yes . a totally normal room to have in a house .
okay .
i 'm sure mr. le bail is with us today .
not that he tells us anything these days . champagne ?
my foster parents were great people
i always sort of dreamed of having a ... a family .
i don 't doubt it .
finally have a real , permanent family .
it all began with a very generous bene@@ factor .
you see , originally . great-@@ grandfather was a merchant seam@@ an .
on one of his many ex@@ cur@@ sions abroad
after discovering a mutual passion for games of chance
that box .
mr. le bail proposed a wag@@ er .
well .
and since that time
our initiate then has the privilege of drawing the card ,
seriously , what the fuck is old maid ?
my dear , it is your turn .
it says , " hide and seek . "
hide and seek , right , dad ?
those are the rules .
well , it 's your initiation , my dear .
of course .
oh , fuck me .
how long does this usually take ?
of course it does not count . it must be the bride .
well , i don 't know . i 'm .. i 'm thinking .
oh , daniel , could you ?
she 's gonna die , guys .
so , what do we do with her ?
give me the fucking lanter@@ ns .
okay .
now ... i had to play along so that i can get you out .
you knew what would happen if i pulled that card .
and if you don 't , you die .
it happened to my great-@@ uncle .
his wife too . same thing happened to my cousin rachel .
you have to play
you wanted to get married .
you 're everything to me
you just need to go straight down this hall@@ way until you get to the service kitchen .
i 'm gonna unlock all the doors . i 'm gonna unlock all the doors .
no , it 's not over
so she 's dead . that 's just a side note
cock ! i forgot my gun .
maybe we 'll find the other one that 's still alive to clean that shit up .
does the help count
we must ...
we must kill the bride by dawn .
calm down . work the problem .
you have no respect for tradition .
don 't you think great-@@ grandfather would ' ve used the security cameras if he had them ?
you pick and choose . pick and choose .
oh , no . that was dad 's idea .
take a minute .
we can 't let her get out . we 've got to guard the doors .
excuse me ?
i knew the girl would draw that card
none of us expected to be doing this tonight .
and , in case you didn 't notice , it wasn 't much of a choice for him .
go wait for stevens . he might need your help .
take the ma@@ ids to the goat pit .
justin
yeah , you can go fuck yourself , justin !
i don 't know . maybe one night when i was chan@@ ting and slic@@ ing the throat of a goat
it felt normal .
if your family says it 's okay .
i 'm gonna do it right here .
hey . look at me . oh , my god . hey , hey look at me .
don 't go . don 't go , okay ?
i meant what i said this morning .
but i 'm not gonna let you hurt my family !
you don 't deserve a family .
afternoon , ray .
yeah , right here .
yeah .
okay .
they weren 't too happy to see me .
run those plates for me .
wow ! you 're loo@@ kin ' j@@ acked ray . you been work@@ in ' out ?
give me the dam@@ ned thing .
before i change my mind , and write you a citation .
would be just perfect .
the company i 'm work@@ in ' for , gonna ' pay you a lot of money .
don 't you at least want to hear what i have to offer ?
now we 're finished talking . you get out the hell out of here !
that 's your decision .
better take the lead
oh my god .
i mean hell , you had a full ride through college .
you really want to do this ?
no , we 're not talking about the war , ok .
what do you care if we 're not together ?
thank you for coming on such short notice at such an early hour .
in 45 seconds , we 'll move a prisoner
we will travel underneath the radar .

look , you can 't pull me out of this right now .
bar@@ ton 's been compromised .

no , all this came from that .
stark tower is your baby .
my private elevator ...

i 'm afraid my protocols are being over@@ ridden .
you have reached the life model deco@@ y of tony stark .

there are always men like you .
let him be an example .
the soldier .

i want to know why lo@@ ki let us take him .
i don 't think we should be focusing on lo@@ ki .
you could smell crazy on him .
lo@@ ki is beyond reason , but he is of as@@ gard .
he killed 80 people in two days .
i think it 's about the mechanics .
it 's a stabil@@ ising agent .
i 'll fly you to portland .

leonard , what if you have an allergic reaction
well , then why don 't you wear the rubber gloves

you don 't , but the surgeon might , hmm ?
shel@@ don , do you realize that driving is ris@@ ki@@ er than surgery ?
that is if you make it to the car
although now that i think about it ,
no , but last year , at magic mountain ,
look , there 's an entire section of my dash@@ board
i 'm odd all the time , everyone knows that .
probably about the same way she treated me .
having $ 10,000 , so she can go to that amazon school
exactly .
we 're really doing her a favour .
what are you doing here ?
you built this city all by yourself " ?
sure did .
i heard that at the wedding .
she 's not seeing anybody yet ?
truth be told , i think she 's still a ... you know .
a virgin ?
and at least just set up a meet and talk to the guy .
she died before they could put the fire out .
they say she 's the one in the family i look the most like .
i don 't think she ever got married , though .
it 's for you .

i thought i was getting better at it , but clearly i 'm not .
there have definitely been days
you 're kind of a sad sack .
i 'm just upset .
i mean , you 're the one who doesn 't want my brother to come , so ..
oh , i 'm gonna throw you so hard ,
that 's because we are .
i don 't need an emotion machine !
thanks , ladies ! this was fun !
well , that was a waste of time .
that 's what i 'm here for .
maybe i 'll just play the field .
the field said no .
awesome job .
finish the chart . i 'll be back .
i need you on pre-@@ ops and post-@@ ops .
yang , you 're with me today .
today ?
congratulations .
is it wrong to have hatred in your heart ?
he was post-@@ op , he was fine
but , uh , he 'd been getting short of breath ,
that it wasn 't a pe@@ . he was bleeding internally .
god , i will never forget the look on his wife 's face ..
how do you live with it ?
kare@@ v , take a hold right at the temple
ten@@ derness around the inci@@ sion is normal .
uh . me@@ gan , will you please go to 20 .
thanks .
uh . i know it seems personal ,
but are they supposed to look like that ?
they 're supposed to be doctors ?
what the hec@@ k do we do with them ?
i guess we should just talk to them .
besides , we 'll just waste time .
but my friends are coming after the surgery .
we met in an online chat room for orch@@ id lovers ,
this device is gonna help prevent lung problems
sit up straight .
hole
you really think that was okay ? !
i 'm sure the chief wouldn 't notice
you can do this .
people don 't really say no to you , do they ?
i 'm saying please .
you ready ?
y-@@ you said you had some friends
they 're coming now .
hi , it 's me sha@@ y@@ na .
he@@ y. did you get my page ?
god , how amazing am i ?
uh , did you take a look at the research
i showed up . i .
or you go dead inside .
if you let yourself feel that ? no way you 're going back .
you blew it off ?
i called every favor i had in this hospital
why didn 't you go ?
oh , why don 't you ? i 'm working really hard on this .
i know how violent surgery can be .
they 're gonna slice open my abdomen
derek shepherd is in the fre@@ akin woods right now
why did you tell me , then ?
just keep your mouth shut
it took us three years to find the right candidate ,
the ethics board will not allow me
you see that orch@@ id ?
i 'm not accepting it , because i 'm older than you ,
and i know you 're gonna need at least one friend
i 'll be here when you do .
what am i gonna say
she took me back .
from anything .
you turn on each other now ,
pierce get an ice pack
and , me@@ gan , you should go to o.@@ b .
that was very bail@@ ey .
wait . i 'm sorry .
now i haven 't asked for much .
i want to go on a tour of russia with my friends next year .
said that was why i was off the program ,
he 'll never bully you again .
no . no , you are nothing like him , ender .
i thought you had a game .
we must conquer or die .
why ? you 'd rather not know what 's going on in the world ?
speak your name .
don 't freeze your balls , kid .
at ease
ask me a legitimate question
when the enemy first invaded , we were not ready .
we threw everything we had at the inv@@ aders .
sergeant , explain the game .
you will train to compete as a team against other teams .
but , if either side gets one cade@@ t
sir , yes , sir !
" and no one ever adequately explains
" everyone here is very different .
" always very little sleep .
" are you getting my e-mails ? i miss you "
i 'm pleased to see that most of you are performing well .
some in the higher ranks have failed to meet our standards
look to your left .
these are not your friends .
keep up the hard work .
drop and give me 20 !
no , sir .
yes , you will , sergeant .
get up !
a useless , skin@@ ny , un@@ trained s@@ not !
let me be clear .
my army is un@@ defeated in the last 21 battles .
what are you doing here ? bon@@ zo will kill you .
well , then get in the game . we 're losing .
put your feet to mine . redirect me .
don 't draw your weapon till you know you have a shot .
in three , two , one ...
where 'd you learn all this ?
come on . let 's go again .
keep ' em to yourself .
how did his psych@@ o brother end up in the game ?
of course he 's feeling pressure , anderson !
the game is a thought relationship
then change the story !
i can 't change that !
erase the game .
top test scores in class .
but you have a habit of up@@ setting your commander .
puts you in a difficult position , doesn 't it ?
you don 't like taking orders from bon@@ zo .
no , co@@ ward .
come out and fight ! come on !
i could break your arm !
we 're gonna send him home . back to earth .
i want to go with him .
you 've come so far
i make it impossible for them to ever hurt me again .
i told them i won 't cooperate .
i think you 're hiding because you 're afraid .
afraid you might lose .
you can 't hide here forever .
i 'll miss you .
i need to know that you will not block my e-mails again .
initiating final approach .
this was a forward staging post
if they 're on their home planet ,
the purpose of this war is to prevent all future wars .
yes , sir .
ic 's breath@@ able , but thin
who are you ?
you wanna fight me ? is that the test ?
i 'll just sit this one out .
since when do you tell the enemy when he has won ?
why didn 't you destroy me immediately after ?
there is no teacher but the enemy .
once our battle fleet is detected
crust we have chosen our commander wel
absolutely .
we 'll be with you soon .
" dear valentine . . so this is command school .
" that i might not measure up .
" and i promise you
harvesting water .
too risky . let 's not reveal our best weapon
" the pressure to win , day after day ,
great work , bean !
ender , watch our right flank !
i see it ! bernard , you flank them !
al@@ ai , peel right !
war isn 't a game where you get to re@@ boot and start over !
nobody 's saying not to take risks .
you focus on the big picture .
sleep deprivation is part of your training !
tf i 'd been smarter ,
there 's no time to train anyone else .
and if i win tomorrow ? what happens ?
and you will be the finest commander we 've ever trained .
what happens when it 's no longer a game ?
she 's right .
protect your carriers .
i saw their whole planet destroyed .
or another queen out there ? there isn 't !
that 's all that matters . ho .
don 't hurt him .
just so he 's not alone .
yes , of course .
it 's dark and scary in here .
they 're fake and hollow , empty inside .
yeah .
my very super-@@ special honeymoon night@@ gown .
sorry . sorry .
" dear ducks ,

i 'm just not really in the mood .
i don 't know .
i can 't help it .
my stomach just feels ick@@ y .
i took a walk in the woods earlier .
where you were sleep@@ walking .

i found footprints .
i don 't want to sleep without you ever again .
i need you .
paul . paul .

two minutes after he left ,

please , just ... just give me another week .
yeah . since i was about three .
my folks are both in the oil business down there .
that 's what it says on my birth certificate .
i could 've got you a great discounted room rate , say , 11 years ago .
ahead of time what i 'm getting into ?
i just wind up tos@@ sing them anyway .
mr. par@@ mit@@ t ? daniel ?
that is so kind , but i 'm afraid i have other plans .
okay .
all right , let 's get it while it 's hot .
we have to lay low .
i don 't understand what the big deal is to go out and get two piz@@ z@@ as .
i 'm getting cheese .
oh , my god !
yeah , dogs like me .
do i need to get you to@@ wels ? oh , my god .
do you wash it ? do you not wash it ?

les@@ lie , listen to me !
a pay phone , and call this number .
might not be an answer but maybe .
in a word , triumph@@ ant .
oh , yes , you should have seen those young people .
i may have changed a few lives today .
i don 't know , i kind of promised howard .
actually , we should all share the moment .
oh , t@@ wee@@ ts about my lecture .
that 's down@@ right cruel .
yeah , i 'm not familiar with the acrony@@ m " k@@ mn " "
i know the feeling .
it-@@ it happened to a friend of mine .
leonard and i are fine ,
he 's such a cu@@ tie .
hi . can i help you ?
yogurt ?
you do ?
all right .
it says " cam@@ ar@@ illo state mental hospital . "
it 's the only explanation i can come up with
let 's just try a different impro@@ v . uh ..
you bet .
i was gonna be famous .
you have any frozen yogurt ?
i took the liberty
why don 't we leave that for future generations to decide ?
it 's the story of a young boy who is transported
she 's probably hungry .
come here , baby . come here , little baby .
ch@@ up@@ o .
see ? we 'll figure it out .
it 's been a month , ab@@ ena . you ready to go home ?
that 's just crazy , right ?
i 'm in the middle of my contract ,
cancer ? he might have cancer ?
he died .
i 'm sorry . i-i said " rule out cancer . "
okay . so that 's , uh ... update the patient .
you are organized .
okay . well , mr. ar@@ anda here needs to
oh , actually , no .
um , how did her baby get tang@@ led up in her intestin@@ es ?
the baby survived a full term outside of the uter@@ us ?
her tubes are scar@@ red , so the fertili@@ zed egg
well , why didn 't it show up on the ultrasound ?
but she still sees me as a patient ,
hey , um , what 's this ?
hey . hunt . uh , my knee replacement got canceled ,
well , it 's my first day back , and i left my baby
it doesn 't have to be big .
okay .
they all sound like her .
what ? what are you doing here ?
no , it 's not .
well , how about you , kare@@ v ?
you .
the job at nam@@ bo@@ ze clinic has never been filled .
there 's a med school loan forgiveness grant attached to it .
i mean , they know you . you 're kind of perfect .
you 'd be great . i could take care of it with one call .
sir .
and it will kill you .
we saw it today . you 're not built for this job .
so just ... just be a surgeon .
are you done ?
thank you for your time .
but what 's wrong with the furniture we have ?
and there was no place for company .
according to the roommate agreement ,
i put you there after you forwarded me
okay , what does all this have to do with the elevator ?
it 's one against one .
but i said no to that .
and i settle all ties .
why ?
so , i get the draft ?
fine .
a sickness had begun to grow within him .
and where sickness thri@@ ves .
the first they heard was a noise like a hurricane coming down from the north .
and that means good food , a warm hear@@ th ..
thank you .
that is private . keep your sticky pa@@ ws off .
not ready for what ?
what on earth are these ?
ah . good gracious . is it today ?
do you think he 'll come ?
gan@@ dal@@ f .
he 'll give us quite a show , you 'll see .
beg your pardon ?
i 'm sorry , do i know you ?
i 'm gan@@ dal@@ f .
old took used to have them on mid@@ summer 's eve . he@@ h , he@@ h . a@@ hem .
and where else should i be ?
well , i 'm pleased to find you remember something about me ..
yes . well , that 's decided .
and most am@@ using for me .
inform the who ? what ? no . no . no .. wait .
i suggest you try over the hill or across the water .
it 's nice , this place .
did you do it yourself ?
that 's my mother 's glory box . can you please not do that ?
mr. d@@ wal@@ in . ha , ha .
" everyone " ? how many more are there ?
there 's far too many dwar@@ ves in my dining room as it is .
... i can only say it is in very poor taste .
gan@@ dal@@ f .
not the jam , please . excuse me . excuse me .
" cheese knife " ? he eats it by the block . u@@ gh .
i cannot hear what you 're saying . it 's an antique . not for sitting on .
excuse me , mr. gan@@ dal@@ f ?
may i temp@@ t you with a cup of cham@@ om@@ ile ?
who@@ op ! mind out .
uh , fil@@ i , kil@@ i . uh ...
he is late , is all . he traveled north to a meeting of our kin . he will come .
it 's got a fru@@ ity bou@@ quet .
bom@@ bur 's on his second leg of lamb already .
wanna bet ?
i 'll help you with that .
what 's the matter ? i 'm surrounded by dwar@@ ves .
oh , they 're quite a merry gathering once you get used to them .
look at the state of my kitchen . there 's mud tro@@ d into the carpet .
airborne fire-@@ brea@@ ther .
extremely fond of precious metals .
i 'm not afraid . i 'm up for it .
sit down .
.. but we number just 13 .
gan@@ dal@@ f will have killed hundreds of dragons in his time .
how many , then ?
well , how many dragons have you killed ?
excuse me . please .
the dragon , s@@ ma@@ ug , has not been seen for 60 years .
... wondering , weighing the risk .
do we sit back while others claim what is righ@@ tfully ours ?
there is no way into the mountain .
how came you by this ?
by train . for safe@@ keeping .
if there is a key ..
these run@@ es speak of a hidden passage to the lower halls .
well , if we can find it , but dwarf doors are invisible when closed .
and i do not have the skill to find it .
the task i have in mind will require a great deal of stealth ...
i cannot guarantee his safety .
nor will i be responsible for his fate .
one-@@ fourteenth of total profit , if any . "
but not limited to lac@@ er@@ ations .
.. than to find out what was beyond the borders of the shire .
it 's out there .
i am a bag@@ g@@ ins of bag@@ -@@ end .
yes .
in the battle of green fields , he charged the go@@ blin ranks .
there are a few warriors amongst us .
i would take each and every one of these dwar@@ ves ..
for when i called upon them , they answered .
a willing heart .
you don 't have to do this .
you 've done honor@@ ably by our people .
a life of peace and plenty .
far over the mi@@ sty mountains cold
can 't stop , i 'm already late !
i 'm going on an adventure !
that 's true enough .
wait !
everything appears to be in order .
to the company of thor@@ in oak@@ en@@ shield .
no , no , that won 't be necessary .
i 've done my fair share of walking holidays , you know ?
or@@ cs ?
the lon@@ e-@@ lands are cra@@ wling with them .
quick and quiet , no scre@@ ams . just lots of blood .
you think a night raid by or@@ cs is a joke ?
no , you didn 't .
here , mr. gan@@ dal@@ f , can 't you do something about this delu@@ ge ?
and it will continue to rain until the rain is done .
are there any ? what ?
the greatest of our order is sar@@ um@@ an the white .
do you know , i 've quite forgotten their names .
i think it would be wis@@ er to move on .
i have told you already ...
why not ? the el@@ ves could help us .
i do not need their advice .
help ?
what help came from the el@@ ves ?
everything tastes like chicken .
what tastes like fish !
oh . " thank you very much , bert . lovely ste@@ w , bert . "
o@@ oh . that is beautifully balanced , that is .
good , isn 't it ?
i was looking for you , gan@@ dal@@ f .
something 's terribly wrong .
just give me a minute .
it was right there on the tip of my tongue .
it 's a silly old ...
to seek refuge with our enemy .
the only ill will to be found in this valley is that which you bring yourself .
they will try to stop us .
if we are to be successful , this will need to be handled with t@@ act .
and no small degree of charm .
stay sharp .
my lord el@@ ron@@ d is not here .
where is he ?
gan@@ dal@@ f . lord el@@ ron@@ d
that may have been us .
i do not believe we have met .
i knew th@@ ror when he ruled under the mountain .
what is he saying ?
try it . just a mou@@ thful .
where 's the meat ?
kind of you to invite us .
well , you never are .
i 'm not actually sure it is a sword .
how did you come by these ?
and what were you doing on the great east road ?
for goodness sake , thor@@ in , show him the map .
it is mine to protect , as are its secrets .
your pride will be your down@@ fall .
who can read that map . show it to lord el@@ ron@@ d .
it 's mainly academic .
you still read ancient dwar@@ v@@ ish , do you not ?
of course .
well , in this case , that is true .
.. of the same shape and season as the day on which they were written .
these run@@ es were written on a mid@@ summer 's eve .
.. a dragon could be used to terrible effect .
gan@@ dal@@ f , the enemy is defeated .
gan@@ dal@@ f , for 400 years we have lived in peace ...
trol@@ ls have come down from the mountains .
or@@ cs have attacked us on the road
.. looking for trouble where none exists .
well , he 's odd , i grant you . he lives a solitary life .
they 've add@@ led his brain and yellow@@ ed his teeth .
caves in the mountain are seldom un@@ occupied .
right , then . let 's get a fire started .
get some sleep .
we were to wait in the mountains until gan@@ dal@@ f joined us .
plans change .
back to ri@@ ven@@ dell .
you 're part of the company . you 're one of us .
thor@@ in said i should never have come and he was right .
well , well , well .
thor@@ in , son of th@@ rain , son of th@@ ror ..
oh , but i 'm forgetting . you don 't have a mountain .
.. which makes you nobody , really .
just a head .
perhaps you know of whom i speak .
now , now , keep your distance !
i don 't want any trouble , do you understand ?
why ? is it lost ?
that 'll do it .
you 've got to be jo@@ king !
there 's too many . we can 't fight them .
come on ! here ! on your feet .
my precious . wait !
it 's weird again .
and what you said is true .
so i had no right to do what i did .
i hope you can forgive me .
a couple years , but i just put a few bucks aside
my god , leonard , do you know
what good is it if you don 't use it ?
i have money i love ,
sid . acute ly@@ mp@@ ho@@ bl@@ astic leukemia .
i 'm patrick . tes@@ tic@@ ular .
basically , they found it in his nuts ...
we 're here for you , haz@@ el .
christ is our friend and he 'll be there till the end
you can let go , swee@@ tie .
that should have been the end .
but then something strange happened . the antibiotics kicked in
it didn 't work in over 70 % of the patients ..
so , they called it " the miracle . "
so , are you back in school ?
wh@@ oa ! a college girl !
oh ! careful !
okay , what 's it about ?
it 's about cancer ?
he 's the only person i 've ever come across in my life .
but , b , hasn 't actually died .
i will read this horrible book with this very boring title .
i know that these are not important literary questions ...
" and , of course , if you ever do decide to write anything else ..
" frankly , i 'd read your grocery lists .
you think ?
is it really 1 : 00 am ?
yeah , i guess it is .
okay .
oh , my god .
you did mo@@ t use , your last dying wish ..
to e@@ 0 to disney world .
it was actually a really fun trip !
okay , i 'm not seeking political asylum . it 's a few days . it 's a vacation !
what if you get sick
i mean , it 's really just the sky . the sky is making me sad .
that my dad built for me when i was a kid and .
well , i demand to see this swing set of tears .
this is one sad swing set .
me in no way less@@ ens my affection for you .
but everything . an on@@ co@@ logist is set there .
i love you .
okay , haz@@ ell grace ?
what 's in your nose ? jack@@ ie !
it 's called a " cann@@ ula . " and it helps me breathe .
the young fans with whom you 've been corresponding
please , come in .
to never have to encounter americans .
the torto@@ ise has a ten-@@ yard head start .
the torto@@ ise has moved maybe one yard , and so on , forever .
you can only decrease his lead .
as long as you don 't contemplate the mechanics involved .
that no one really solved it ..
haz@@ el , i 'm sorry . i have no idea what 's going on .
has the cancer found its way into your brain ?
please ?
because she dies , or that she becomes too sick to continue ...
i said i 'm not interested .
nothing happens ! they 're fiction !
but they can 't !
i do not want your pity !
like all sick kids , your existence depends on it .
peter !
a child who believes there is a life after a novel ends .
so , we pay for your treatments , your oxygen machines .
you are a side-@@ effect to an evolutionary process ..
you are a failed experiment in mutation .
be better than any piece of shit that di@@ run@@ k guy could write .
you 'll love it .
no , you did not spend it on him . you spent it on us .
i 'm very sorry .
i thought meeting you would help him ...
but .. i 'm very sorry .
you see , we may not look like much ..
and two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half working pairs of lungs .
so if i were you , i would go back inside .
i mean , i was supposed to be special .
yeah , i know . but
you know this obsession you have with being remembered ?
i am mad .
you think that the only way to lead a meaningful life ..
i 'm sorry . you 're right .
hey .
it 's not over yet , you know .
when the pain is , just for a minute , bearable .
that your last good day is your last good day .
hello , augu@@ stus .
i decided to plan this pre-@@ funeral .
augu@@ stus waters was a coc@@ ky son of a bitch .
not because of his super@@ human good looks ..
18 years , buddy .
i 'm assuming you have a little more time , you interrup@@ ting bast@@ ard .
but when the scientists from the future ...
i 'm gonna tell those scientists to p@@ iss off , because ..
i don 't .
then , having made my point , i 'll probably put the robot eyes on ...
and i don 't know ... um ..
god@@ speed .
haz@@ el , can i get a hand here ?
yeah , and turn around . sit down . there you go .
my name is haz@@ el grace lan@@ caster ..
ours was an epic love story ...
like all real love stories
i 'm not gonna talk about our love story , because i can 't .
i am not a mathematician , but i do know this .
there 's poin@@ t-@@ one , poin@@ t-@@ one-@@ two , and poin@@ t-@@ one-@@ one-@@ two , and ...
of course , there is a bigger infinite set of numbers between zero and two ..
for our little infin@@ ity .
you gave me a forever ..
and for that , i am ..
i love you so much .
augu@@ stus waters died eight days later in the ic@@ u .
stopped his heart , which was also made of him
every second , worse than the last .
is to rate your pain on a scale from one to ten .
and i remember once ..
though i couldn 't speak , i held up nine fingers .
oh . so , you read your fan mail now ?
he de@@ tested me .
and tell you what became of anna and her mother ..
i don 't want to read anything . can you just get out of my car ?
can i come in ?
yeah .
to love him ?
there 's a friend here to see you .
gus really loved you , you know ?
he wouldn 't shut up about it .
i didn 't find it that annoying .
did you get that letter from your author friend ?
how do you know about that ?
and he said he came all this way to give that letter to you .
i have no interest in reading another word of that as@@ sh@@ ole 's again .
what ?
mr. van h@@ out@@ en , i 'm a good person , but a sh@@ it@@ ty writer .
i think we 'd make a good team .
let 's go !
outstanding performance !
do you have any last requests ?
" your reign of justice is over , tur@@ bo rider ,
hey !
it 's , um , it 's a comic book .
j@@ t 's about tur@@ bo rider ?
do you have any friends ?
i found a new friend . i 'll be fine i promise .
sir , sir ?
are you saying we should abandon my brother ?
chance ? is that how you think i became a champion ?
so what is the plan ?
who needs chance any@@ ways ?
how 'd i know that was gonna be you ?
here you go .
wh@@ oa !
now , you gotta tag me back , if you can !
where ?
wanna see something cool ?
wh@@ oa , that 's a t-@@ rex .
and they got killed off by this big explosion .
our defence 6@@ rid has been breached .
this is it soldier .
you are our ast hope .
i 'm coming , apple .
may i introduce frederick , the one-@@ handed arm wrest@@ ler .
we all know how generous of spirit i am , and i 'm going to grant him his wish .
you like science ? i absolutely love it .
your blood is 83 % water , your muscle tissue , 75 %
which brings the grand total to ten precious gallons of h@@ 20 .
i hope you choke on it , you mother fuc@@ ker !
my beloved followers , who keeps you safe ?
where , uh , where are we ?
you got pretty beat up . you came back to save me .
you look pretty good in that suit .
wish i could have been more like the real tur@@ bo rider .
i wish i could have stopped him , i should have .
i 'll shut down , for good .
yeah , yeah i 'll die .
kid ? look at you !
look , we need your help .
i don 't care what kind of trouble you got yourself into ,
give me that back , young lady !
yes , and if i were you , i 'd be packing too .
there 's a shit storm coming !
but just because it 's you .
there , you 'll find your .. robot cemetery .
that is , if you 're still alive .
apple !
why does this aching son of a bitch always have to happen to me ?
oh , yes .
wait , how can you eat if you 're a robot ?
the illusion works better if i behave 100 % like a human .
well , i actually think it 's kind of cool
do you want me to teach you ?
so when the apoc@@ aly@@ pse happened
y@@ up , with my father . up there in the sky .
i 'm , i 'm sorry .

so wanted to kill you , myself !
correspondence from ma@@ thi@@ as william bre@@ ec@@ her .
defensive measures were taken

none of these men will let themselves be hanged , sir .
i can only imagine their surprise when a man arrived to stretch their neck .

that is the burden i must carry in this life .
will these accommodations be all right ?
sarah
better to have two loaded guns when needed .
or of the law-@@ breaking kind .
it 's been such a long time since we 've had a horse here .
probably because we can 't keep ' em alive .
you see there 's some men around here who would like to see this land taken from us .
it was his men you saw here this morning .
they 'll do anything to try and run us off .
mo@@ w you 're really tempting me to ask what it is you do for a living .
you come to see my father .
haunted like
afraid of possible repercussions from his actions .
he feared that somehow we 'd be caught up in whatever was coming for him .
she hated it , and she died shortly after we came here .
but there 's good in him , i seen it .
i 'm dying , and my daughter has to watch it .
if i was to oblige you , it would involve a no@@ ose .
i 'm no sne@@ ak , sir .
that is mur@@ der@@ ous .
jesus christ , you use murder as a business .
if i hang you , it is by decree of the courts .
pardon the intrusion
no man should endure such pain .
no amount of money or pride or honor is worth all of this .
i do not know how to be still , sarah .
the brown mare outside , it 's mine .
thank you , ma@@ m .
gentlemen , pair of f@@ ours .
maybe i 'm not either
it 's rude not to drink with a lady .
jas@@ per , i told you once already
what in the sam hill i do to you to score me as such ?
class for one thing .
ain 't seen your lik@@ eness around these parts before .

thank you kindly .
i think you can handle affection better than you give yourself credit for .
i think i should go .
keep it .
the easiest way to overcome one addiction ...
thanks , but i 'm working , so you gotta go .
the least you can do is open it so we can bas@@ k in your happy expression .
it was hyster@@ ic@@ al. thought the whole wedding day was ruined .
it felt spontaneous .

i mean , he is the only one at this din@@ er
for as long as i 've known earl ,

" miss doesn 't invite people to stuff . "
that 's what i told roy orb@@ ison
we 're friends of earl .
you know , earl .
ruby , come on , can 't you just let him play ?

i don 't hate you . sam . i feel sorry for you .

so i 'm gonna put the bomb in the trunk ,

you said it was the only way you 'd take me back .
really ?
andrew ran over carlos ' mother and told no one .
andrew was a child at the time .
or@@ son , please .
i 'm just curious why
i never should have asked you to make that sacrifice .
i respected you for demanding better of me .
you insisted i live up to your standards ,
from the moment you told me what andrew had done
what ?
for god sa@@ kes , or@@ son .
we always have a choice ,
you think you can keep patrick occupied for ten minutes ?
oh , man .
yeah : just a little light-@@ headed .
you 're gonna have so much fun in new york .
and you can finally stop running .
right ? i mean , patrick is dead .
is there anything i can do ?
you can give me your permission to do something
what if we don 't say anything ?
the priest knows .
just a suggestion .
this could ruin the hospital .
i know one of these families .
oh , you know what ? i don 't know .
you know who would make a fortune ?
i 'm bored .
cry me a river .
i-i 'm not loving this attitude .
so she 's out all day ?
it 's off .
pil@@ ar , i brought you a coffee .
jay , you devil .
it 's beautiful , no ?
all the men in our family wear this .
oh , tradition . oh , it 's so important .
that has been in my family for three generations .
hen .
i 'm just being honest with you .
that 's good . i should be more honest with you sometimes .
i don 't like you , jay .
i knew the answer to that question .
i started by going to see my buddy sta@@ v@@ ros the flor@@ ist .
yes ?
oh , thank you .
how good is lamb , huh ?
oh ! got@@ cha .
i 'm so sorry .
oh , no . no . i ...
so i decided i 'd prove it to them
but , you know , since you 're one of the cool kids ,
hey , lee , it 's phil dun@@ phy from down the street .
listen , we 'd love to have you and the m@@ issu@@ s over for a glass of wine ,
well , look whose teeth got so nice and straight .
are you kidding ?
i mean , i 'm the last one who should be complaining
let 's just get ready for church .
i get it . just don 't beat yourself up .
really ? you 're taking zero of the responsibility , or ..
maybe just a little .
look , cam , if you 're looking for me to be the bad guy ;
oh , well , maybe i 'll just start today .
i think i already do .
but when he stops trying so hard ,
i 'd like to tell you the story
so it 's morning . my car 's getting wa@@ xed .
i hear this ador@@ able accent .
i send over a piece of pie .
couple of minutes later ,
she sits down , we start talking ,
yes !
that 's where she gets it from !
i said i wasn 't gonna cry ,
okay ! that 's it !
fine . everyone just abandon me .
not even this guy .
but you 're an attractive woman with a lot to offer .
i don 't even think i knew what happiness was till i was 60 .
s@@ onia , we 're gonna help you get your own place ,
no , um ..
well , there can be some margin of error ,
that explains it
run !
l just saw ow@@ en@@ major owen hunt
well , yeah , he was and now he 's here
so .. so we kis@@ se@@ d.@@ i mean he kissed me .
but you don 't think he thinks it was a stupid nothing .
what 's he doing back ?
coast clear ?
uh , yes , i did .
thank you , sir
i want you to be the best and if you 're gonna succeed me
with the 24 remo@@ vable organs
oh , that 's not fair .
dr. yang , what exactly happens in a skills lab ?
damn it .
impossible .
don 't get emotional . bail@@ ey .
still ... i 'd like you on my team .
it must have been awful .
get it together three
kare@@ v , are you a doctor ?
are you capable of assessing a patient 's injuries ?
like i said , we got it covered .
why don 't you let us just dive in ?
three other hospitals have already sent them away
we can try and cut around the stomach .
so why don 't we take out the stomach and the kid@@ neys ?
we 're talking about
who are those people ?
any luck ?
look , i know you want to be number one richard ,
it 's your call , dr. bail@@ ey
what if we just took out each of the organs
even if you take them out one by one
dr. bail@@ ey let 's throw some stuff up on the board .
yes ?
what ?
you haven 't been able to look at me all day .
but , hey if you say so .
so instead of worrying
ready
he wants to talk to you about his daughter .
i already told him that .
ch@@ iet , you need to go talk to them .
what i hell ?
is that glue ? you used skin glue ?
yeah , well , because dr. hunt didn 't have you
well , he says the e.@@ r is like being in the field .
is it too late for a transplant ?
and a gold star for grey .
oh , put even more synthetic material in her ?
nice work on the valve .
are you done beating me up for the day ?
that attitude that 's from before .
we don 't have to torture live creatures .
you don 't know that you don 't know that .
you don 't know how scared they were .
and then i got discharged .
i knew your name in the before .
you didn 't have anyone .
you 're a living reminder of every failure in my life .
and if i thought i 'm sorry
some end in an uneasy truce .
i know i 'm supposed to but .
don 't let them suffer .
afraid not .
i guess i 'll , uh see you around .
nowhere . he was just downstairs .
we should go to bed , yeah ? it 's getting so late .
all right , i think that 's gonna hold it .
sure .
they didn 't give a shit ,
we can never do that to bran@@ don .
he will .
oh , you picked a good night to start filming .
this is gonna be fun .
he said to hurry over , so we got out of bed and came in .
look . i 've still got my slip@@ pers on .
today is the day . today is my transplant day .
gonna get me some arms !
several months ago , a gun@@ man ro@@ amed these h@@ se halls ,
we have installed a number of new , uh , security measures .
so what
great . thank you .
i 've been here two hours .
lily , i told you already ,
how have i changed since the shooting ?
uh , i got this .
yes , and yes ,
did you get the parking ticket ?
i haven 't been back to the hospital since that day .
it 's okay . it 's all right .
not too loud , okay ?
some of these kids are in here for weeks .
but i mean , we try to help out .
but a lot of these kids spend a lot of time alone .
doesn 't mean they 're bad parents .
i found out last night that he .
just before the phone rang , i had this ...
motorcycles ...
i know sam would want to donate whatever he could ,
absolutely . i have no problem with that .
what if we try a bypass instead ?
we grew up together , went to med school together .
he 's kin@@ da like my better half .
so when i heard he got shot ..
we tell them their loved ones are hurt
and for the first time in my life ,
no , no , you 're thinking like a nerve guy .
goes blood supply , then nerves .
um , hello , what about the bones ?
to isolate different areas of the hospital in case of an emergency .
even with the kin@@ ks , i think people feel safer ,
which is when sam said , " okay , "
after that , every time ...
i 'd catch a glimpse of that tat@@ too ,
he loves me .
i don 't even like kids .
pedi@@ atric surgery
or you 're gonna mess up the test .
lily , you can 't have this in the machine , okay ?
hey , look , guys ,
can we cut ?
things are always evolving around here ..
always for the better .
uh , yeah , i mean , he already has some feeling
you 're the one who 's gonna lose her driving privileges .
all we have to do is keep it from mom
listen to you .
u@@ gh . you sound like mom .
it was a supportive " wa@@ h-@@ wah . "
well , i was just trying to salvage that story , okay ?
it did not die . it 's a thinker .
so how long have i been embarrassing you with my stories ?
i love your stories , okay ?
see ? those are funny . you have so many great ones .
rain or shine , there 's always a bum@@ per crop of stories .
phil , why didn 't you just put the extra leaves in the table ?
one long table , honey .
i 'm having second thoughts about this cen@@ ter@@ piece .
hear him out .
that 's the plan .
except maybe my sadness will inspire me
you did this . you know that .
so ..
oh , several times .
with co@@ dy and the friends ?
but the question is , who here thinks i made that up ?
and here we have the dream@@ ers , the artists , the vi@@ sion@@ aries .
so we 're supposed to believe that
let 's go to the football field .
yeah ! let 's settle this !
bravo ! bravo ! when i say " pun@@ kin , " you say " chun@@ kin " !
i win their hearts and minds ,
some may need more convincing than others .
i know how to deal with a dr. web@@ ber .
chief .
thank you , really , but i don 't do caffeine .
noted .
let 's make it a good morning , everyone .
the baby 's coming , but you 're not fully dil@@ ated .
pel@@ vic fracture along with bilateral hip dis@@ locations .
the pel@@ vis is broken , tra@@ pping the baby 's head .
min@@ dy , we 're gonna take you for some ct sc@@ ans .
cheers .
nobody ? somebody has to know something .
was that me@@ red@@ ith ? she can 't find alex ?
well , i was there last night ,
okay , so we need to do a c-@@ section
okay , murphy ,
any pain when i press down here ?
yeah , we 're gonna take a look at that , too .
i was driving like a bat out of hell .
is she gonna be able to have her baby ?
you probably can 't tell me anything , anyway .
i 'm not her family , just a taxi driver .
just kind of got invested .
almost .
and ...
gonna order a head ct .
you 'll take my lead .
dr. min@@ nick , hi .
that would be amazing .
and , apparently , we need to hire a new pe@@ ds surgery chief .
murphy , um , can you go make sure
i 'm not actually asking . it 's my job .
it 's my patient .
that seems like a very di@@ sta@@ ste@@ ful way
and richard web@@ ber , he 's a friend of mine ,
nothing .
i can 't tell if this is
shouldn 't take long .
barely missed his eye .
we 'll see more once we get in there .
dr. min@@ nick . first day ?
this the hockey kid that got the worst of it ?
he took a stick to the neck
then when will he learn ?
not on this one .
i 'll have mitchell assist .
why isn 't she crying ?
right angle . rob@@ bins , pass me the vessel loop .
br@@ yan ,
i could 've told you exactly how that would play out .
i didn 't think you could make it any worse for that poor guy ...
deb@@ a@@ key pic@@ ku@@ ps .
scissors ?
i haven 't heard anything about your pregnant lady yet .
damn it !
can i get a nurse over here ? !
and set up for intu@@ bation !
is the baby on ec@@ mo ? did you get help ?
in the o.@@ r. i 'll join you .
i was hired here to do a job , and i think it 's time ...
what ?
this rib punc@@ tured the lung .
are you kidding ?
you got to shake up the other team ...
gar@@ th is the enfor@@ cer .
upset the other team .
fights can be strategic , too .
it also rallies the team against a common enemy .
and i thought i was just gonna learn about surgery .
isn 't that why you allowed me into an o.@@ r. ?
you said fighting is the good part , right ?
hey , how goes the battle for hearts and minds ?
well , that sounds like someone who 's won no hearts or minds .
they push back . eventually , everyone gets on the same page .
i 'll call a meeting .
this is not a fight you should be having , dr. min@@ nick .
you do this a lot ?
major surgery on a newborn right here ?
and the mom might already be ..
let 's do this .
i was in path . i was getting a culture .
it 's fine , ' cause i covered for you , but .. talk to someone .
what do you need , warren ?
very simple . if i can 't be a partner ,
where are you ? ab@@ by ?
i will call you later .
she won 't listen to her parents !
oh , christ .
i will never understand this crazy country .
coming soon to a theater near you .
just add some graphics over the shot that say , " no one will hear this scream . "
it 's so weird .
let 's have a drink
but then , i needed more .
and so began m@@ isha 's career as a marke@@ ter-@@ spy .
and because of you and your incredible work ..
okay , so look , ab@@ by .
why do you think ?
as a result , restaurant chain dim song
you tell him that now is the time to open and advertise his restaurants .
and tell him that i would suggest not limiting his campaign to russia alone .
following the government 's ban
whether this new@@ found love of all things vegetable will stick ,
ab@@ by , it 's me . everything 's changed now .
i know it sounded crazy when i told you
believe me , i do .
but , perhaps ...
wait , what were you gonna say ?
oh , oh , and , um , i also really like that idea
ce@@ dri@@ c 's friend is having this
no ... yeah .
well , it kind of depends on the cake situation .
and he 's not the brightest but he 's pretty ,
i am going backwards !
he moved on , so what , so can you .
no drinks , no dinner , just a ho@@ ok@@ -@@ id .
sure@@ . are you thinking a bar ?
172 class@@ on ave . apartment 2 . brooklyn ny .

um , yes , i think so .
that is awesome .
that will be a very nice thing to happen , me@@ gan .
okay .
there 's nothing we can do .
this could be every day .
helicopter me out of here or something ?
this is what i deserve , it 's pen@@ ance .
um , so you really think god made this bl@@ iz@@ zard
right , that makes sense .
it didn 't happen .
no , that 's like trying to get
i have seen your penis .
those are big things .
uh , no , no , i did not .
you can 't just ...
i think you underestimate us .
it just keeps coming .
no , i mean the punishments from the universe .
where the fuck is your plun@@ ger ?
ah , shit , i let my buddy borrow my plun@@ ger , dam@@ mit .
yeah , me neither , that was just a test .
ye@@ p , i 'm going to do it , i 'm gonna get high .
your apartment .
my buddy made it .
i try to encourage his creativity .

i am an epic dancer , but you see .
so you have to stay here .
okay , um ..
and with that in mind
practice on my hand a lot
well , yeah , let 's talk about this .
yeah , what did i do wrong ?
you know , how they fit together .
do you think we did ?
you don 't know what to say ,
it 's not like that changes after the first time .
you can never talk about it openly
wow .
or maybe it 's just me .
you go and you have to do this activity with a partner
what camp did you go to ? holy shit
it 's a pretty good opportunity right now .
yeah .
that 's the international thing .
and that is not a fantasy of yours ?
do you remember what it was that i said ?
and then after i said that ,
um , i mean , honestly ,
i thought i was doing something like that .
okay .
oh , and you went like way too fast ,
oh , okay , all right .
it 's not like we 're competing on some
so next time , just hold the girl ,
i just got off the phone with the governor 's office
i can 't say that , okay .
i can 't take any more cri@@ ti@@ ques .
tried again .
for .
yeah , i think it would be really helpful for me .
okay , get over here .
they should label it or something , right ?
that 's good , yeah , where were we ?
ah , a fan of the bed push .
there 's never a good time for it so , you know ..
good compromise .
i 'm like the un of doing it .
yeah , that 's good
right back at you .
m@@ m-@@ mm .
it wouldn 't even make sense to you .
it 's the burden of being a genius .
it 's not that i stopped wanting to be a doctor .
no , i meant i didn 't change my mind .
whatever it is that you think that you need
i have this .. i got the desk . "
you 're kicking and screaming
like you 're dead .

yeah , one sec .
see ? you just did
you have the place to yourself , and , boy ...
when does she get back ?
i heard about that .
it 's not a party , it 's a bunch of people
and i did something stupid , and i 'm sorry .
and what if they 're not ?
okay , so what now ?
he owes me for a plun@@ ger .
let me know when you 're out .
can i ask you something ?
me@@ gan , right ?
actually they 're asking for you specifically
why ?
this guy is a psych@@ op@@ ath .
he is setting this whole thing up !
he is so crazy that he is forcing me to sound crazy .
ma 'am

pretty .
i have chased you ' round the moons of ni@@ bia

let 's go . come on , come on !
that guy 's done in this war .
push more to the next level
get up .
i 'm not a doctor . i 'm a 3@@ r@@ d-@@ year med student
in our judgment , your assessment is extreme .
our request comes from my country 's highest level .
then we will regard this as an act of economic war .
yes , minister .
anything you activate
but of course .
i think we have to .
these are just the ones i managed to find .
you pay me to look .
to@@ ke .
i don 't know what to think .
jesus i. chris
oh , no .
maintain the room . wait for two rings , then exit .
i , uh ..
i heard you , i just don 't remember the address , okay ?
you are breaking protocol , corner@@ back .
i just need the address .
then leave quickly and quietly .
then , go to star@@ aya square , the steps .
grabbed it out of somebody 's yard .
what did he do ? she .
somebody who just
the dollar should be going down , but it 's up .
i think they 're prop@@ ping us up .
i think there 's a coordinated plot within russia
your room should be clean by now . we 'll put a watch on it .
in about that much water
you 're operational now .
you will aven@@ ge our family .
everyone is in place , sir , in america and in moscow .
hi . jack ryan to see mr. che@@ rev@@ in .
how was your flight ?
and the jet lag ?
i survived .
so , you know your history .
routine audit .
not when you 're conce@@ aling accounts from us .
but i wonder if perhaps you are just rude .
nothing here is concealed . only secured .
i ordered the companies which concerned you , quite unnecessarily , i might add ,
the funds were transferred this morning ,
i see
di@@ mit@@ ri lem@@ kov , our head of security .
i 'm sorry you had to come all this way for nothing , mr. ryan .
but you 've got another problem , jack .
you know , i wanted to make this grand gesture .
so , i 'm here .
i don 't know . but you have to talk to me .
and he already has a job at the auto plant .
a real mother would
he has torn down the strongh@@ olds
and its princes down to the ground in dis@@ honor .
to him , something will be off
you got to get her out of here . send her home .
these are dangerous people , ca@@ thy . you cannot be here .
i took an oath
no , of course not .
i think you actually enjoyed it .
no , you can 't .
this is geop@@ oli@@ tics , it 's not couples therapy .
there 's a very real scenario here where we don 't get out of this alive .
now , we had about eight minutes to discuss this lit@@ t
you plug this into any 220 outlet that shares the same wall with him .
how much time will he need to run the program ?
so the answer to your question , yes .
all right .
huh ? what do you think ?
i won 't allow it .
please , sit down .
that 's a rather personal question .
i 'd rather talk than make ch@@ it-@@ chat , wouldn 't you ?
trust
i had a mis@@ spent sop@@ hom@@ ore year .
m@@ mm .
desperate , yes . and in@@ sati@@ able .
you don 't understand . aging isn 't the problem .
not if you 've lived a life without regret .
you 're stage three , aren 't you ?
excuse me .
we clean the premises and get the hell out of there .
we are tracking them .
vod@@ ka ,
once we break it down .
hat ? the sell order .
tokyo , london , shanghai , a dozen other exchanges .
do you think jack will get to you ?
you think this is game , jack ?
ca@@ thy !
you think i will let myself die for nothing ?
you can catch him at the corner . run straight ahead .
now , i have my hand beneath your bitch chin !
so , i will say it once more ,
come on ! let 's go !
the attack is going to happen , ryan !
jack , we need to get out of here .
i got her ! she 's in ! she 's in ! she 's in !
they 're the same kid .
and then he went black ?
by now , he could be anywhere .
he would dump it , right ? he 'd dump it .
bear with me .
there 's a way into him , i know it .
all right , drive safe .
che@@ rev@@ in couldn 't do this alone .
the attending physician , mikhail yu@@ re@@ yo@@ vich ,
oh , te@@ sus .
get me harper .
discarded tags , auto paint , paint thin@@ ner .
tell e@@ bi we can be at the site in ten minutes .
an agent will stay with you .
they murdered the teachers and abducted 17 of the students at gun@@ point .
oldest , 13 .
some of my ex-@@ colleagues at the cia feel differently .
that means they 're moving them soon .
has to be done quickly ...
you can name your price .
peace be with you .
are we too late ?
probably bibl@@ ically .
he 's got nick@@ y and joe .
i 've got to go .
i am truly honored to meet you .
what they are yet , i know not ,
when dr. a@@ very was here ,
richard , this thing is a monster .
i d be operating by the seat of my pants .
a tumor like this calls for a metho@@ dical analysis of the sc@@ ans ,
i didn 't see that coming .
let 's not make this personal .
and you 're right .
" well , my back kin@@ da hurts , but the breathing ....
what :
come on . now try it .
i 've never breath@@ ed like that in my life .
i 've never breath@@ ed like that in mv life .
what ?
he 's not dead .
dude , you 're lucky you have a famous last name .
my having .. trouble doing that .
when he was 9 , they removed his right lung .
there she is .. by your kidney .
that 's why it was hard to hear your heart@@ beat .
molly . molly .
do you like to breathe ?
we 're just ..
the risks with the surgery are very high .
would kill me .
uh , so asking you out tonight ...
y-@@ you think ?
cool .
exactly . why not have a little fun ?
eat it and forget about it . right ?
this might be the best idea i 've ever had .
ye@@ p , that or kick you off the case .
i 've been doing this a long time , dr. yang .
now ...
if you would like to real@@ ign your allegi@@ ances .
you mess with him , he might sta@@ b me with a scal@@ pel .
what ?
no , it 's not a bad idea . it 's happy and easy .
you know . i-i am telling you , ending it
yeah , let 's go .
i 'm about to do a consult .
uh , lun@@ ch@@ time .
i do things at lun@@ ch@@ time .
i 've done this 300 times , and it 's still not working .
she held up two postage stamps
i am a woman ,
fine . i 'm not putting a gun to your head .
damn it . this is not supposed to be liquid .
you know , what if i 'm no longer .. patient enough
you can do this .
this cy@@ st was massive .
au@@ dre@@ y ...
it is a long time .
you are gambling away my daughter 's wedding .
condoms .
they have them in the clinic .
miranda .
okay . any@@ how , i would 've pe@@ gged you for the diaphragm type .
maybe if owen , uh , agreed to
hunt was more than halfway done
waste .
it 's exactly what my grandfather had in mind
this message was brought to you
you know , we 're not a team .
i watched you to@@ day@@ . watch te@@ ddy and mark .
you were jealous .
and she 's finally happy .
that 's a team .
mm , tried it . they said it won 't work .
no , they 're just not invested in it like i am .
it 's not liquid .
oh , my god .
i , uh , i don 't know . i don 't know .
i thought i wasn 't seeing you until the weekend .
just didn 't seem right .
that 's a bold move , letting the second years
tell me which one deserves it .
i put it on every year and call it a day .
halloween was ... kind of my family 's thing ,
i 'll figure out what to put on it .
how is this guy stable ?
cops shot him before he ate that other guy 's whole face off .
barely slowed him down .
no . well , we had some candy last night during the movie ,
all right , she has some guarding and a fever ,
i still get to trick@@ -@@ or-@@ treat , right ?
you go around with these huge pil@@ low@@ cases .
he didn 't die .
i thought he was just crazy .
then why didn 't he die ? !
i need you to calm it down , okay ?
it 's just sore .
oh , my god .
uh , walker . mar@@ ge walker .
mom ? uh , sorry . she 's a little afraid of hospitals .
uh , it says you hurt your leg ?
she 's been pop@@ ping i@@ bu@@ prof@@ en like it 's candy .
it 's fine . philip , take me home .
just try to relax , okay ?
at first , they were a little bit blur@@ ry
i 'm fine .
but i wanna be helpful .
yeah . yeah , fine .
so ... you made all his costumes from scratch , huh ?
i know you think he 's an ass , but he 's not .
don 't even
i 've been doing that . it 's not working .
you 'll be here the whole time , me@@ red@@ ith ?
okay . yes .
okay .
she just has to look like a butterfly .
how 'd you swing the time off ?
halloween was always my favorite night as a kid ,
i don 't have the time .
i 'm sorry for saying that you were the wrong choice
because i 've remembered what it is to live for .
so i 'm sorry .
what is that , a fan ?
now if i can get the fan to go in through a bur@@ r hole
how have i never thought of this yet ?
it 's only been a week , but , uh , no .
you didn 't think you should put that in her chart ?
thanks for your help , and i 'm sorry
she was just here .
i need an i.@@ v. hydro@@ cor@@ tis@@ one and a central line kit .
and get her to the e.@@ r .
this doesn 't look like a hospital .
and philip is bringing some more of your things from home .
do you want me to stay ?
you gotta enjoy it while you can .
yeah , and you can make it to your party .
i am . you know , i 'll show up .
good .
" if you 're coming to the party , could you bring cup@@ cakes ?
um ... it 's no problem if i don 't go ,
or will someone else bring them ?
and when i went to put his into the hazardous waste , i ...
and it jam@@ med right into my palm .
and i had never felt fear like that in my whole life .
enlarge the inci@@ sion with a dis@@ sec@@ ting instrument
faster .. but take your time .
he doesn 't want me to tell anyone ,
and you know him better than i do .
i can 't ?
if he told you , he trusted you .
i mean , of course he 's gonna to push you away
well , um , we took a look at your previous inci@@ sion
there 's a surprise around every corner .
good for you .
what 's wrong ? you still blind ?
also , no hepatitis .
i 've ri@@ gged the ceiling with three sun@@ max ultraviolet lights ...
.... as the sun at high noon .
... i suggest you stand and show yourselves .
i 'm a vampire .
i 'm sure we can handle it .
yes .
we 've gone into ne@@ sts like this before : seattle , new orleans .
this one might be different though .
whatever it is , i 'm certain she 's brought backup .
yeah . what if she disappears ?
use the daylight as usual .
if it 's daylight , what about you ?
right .
you think this was my fault !
well , fuck you . everything was fine until you showed up .
fuck .
are they still out there ?
.. by evening time as another front moves in from the south .
temperatures cooling down .
so , what do you do when all this is done ?
once we got it done , if i survived ...
... put on my ro@@ be .
.. sit on my porch .
... drink it while the sun come up .
but i don 't think like that anymore .
like i wanna put this all behind me .
they won 't come out if we 're near the light .
yeah , well , it won 't be dark for long .
shit .
hold still .
you gotta be quiet now .
can you try to remember ?
i think so .
i saw army boats .
dane !
wait , wait , wait . we cannot be stuck on this ship .
we don 't have a choice .
were blending in with his clients memories
now it seems , senator rock@@ ford is betting his political career on mind@@ scape ..
john is here .
i 'm great .
no , i 'm done with all that .
i 'm not there yet .
you should move on from what happened to your wife .
i 'm so sorry . don 't worry about it .
here .. sit down ! sorry .
oh , yeah , yeah . peter l@@ und@@ gre@@ n is already working on the case .
c '@@ mon ! i was better than him on my worst day !
and l@@ und@@ gren@@ s ' success nowadays is close to 100 percent .
as it happens , i , uh ..
her name is anna .
she used to be my patient when she was little .
she 's a teenager now , but i don 't think a ... . a doctor can help .
well , what 's her problem ?
john ...
hi john , i 'm so happy you 're back in the sadd@@ le .
into letting her out of the house .
try to find a trauma for her therapist to work on@@ . bye .
when was the last time she ate ?
she 's taking vitamins and drinking water , but nothing else .
i 'm sure anna can get better here .
this is a matter that requires great discretion .
be disseminated beyond michelle and myself .
anna is so special , she 's so many talents , she 's
he died ... when i was pregnant .
does anna get along with robert ?
i see . this way .
she wants to go back to school , but that 's impossible .
we need to protect her .
swee@@ tie . this is john ...
aren 't you late for your aa meeting , mom ?
do you mind ? do you mind ?
that 's quite the party trick you have there .
i like the rhythm when i draw . it 's soo@@ thing
at the funeral , she sees this guy she 's never seen before .
and she thinks he 's amazing . he 's everything she 's ever wanted .
but , in the crowds at the funeral , she gets separated
what 's her motive for killing her sister ?
did i get it right ?
depends on what you 're looking for .
the more logical outcome would be for the girl to kill her father .
if the girl didn 't know the man , it 's unlikely her sister would .
so it would make more sense for her to kill her father .
that 's probably true .
what game are you playing , honey ?
you have to be quiet .
mommy 's not feeling well today .
we have a responsibility ! we are not the right people !
come with me , young lady ! dad ! let me down !
for god 's sa@@ kes , she 's only a girl !
i 'll show you a picture .
it 's up to you .
and something like l@@ sd in my food would make me act crazy .
they send me to an institution on monday .
please , john , you have to help me prove that i 'm innocent .
i ... i can 't get send away to a mental institution .
are you here for anna or for me ?
but i need to know what happened .
i thought i locked the door .
ah@@ . doesn 't work like that .
know what ?
did he hit on me ?
there 's nothing going on between me and robert
sebastian has it
you said this was a simple case .
maybe you 're not ready to come back .
if you 'd sent me the file earlier , maybe i could have prevented all this .
i 'm anna 's best hope right now .
do you know why you 're here , anna ?
t@@ for just one day , can we talk about something other than me ?
can you tell me about your relationship with your parents ?
her heart 's like .... one of those fancy ice sculptures they have at parties .
it 's my parents who are crazy .... not me
did he take pictures of you ?
i can still see the exact pattern when i close my eyes .
don 't we all die in the end ?
there are other ways to be free .
then what do you do ?
how do you feel when you draw ?
like nothing else matters .
can i see it ?
can i have your bag ?
my real name is me@@ gan , me@@ gan scan@@ lon .
what 's she really like ?
beat up a horse or something .
look , just because i 've been assigned to watch over you ..
do you know who might have done this ?
who takes the harmful effects of alcohol very seriously .
hey , anna , look .
oh , don 't worry about it .
can me@@ gan come ?
yeah , she is .
roses don 't grow during the winter .
i didn 't do anything to those girls , if that 's what you 're implying
anna blamed it all on another girl , mou@@ sey .
not even susan mer@@ rick s family was able to take anna to court .
su@@ is@@ an mer@@ rick ?
are you a cop ?
what ? has she died or something ?
you think anna was responsible .
miss mer@@ rick , i know what you 've been through .
i really need your help .
yeah .. sure i do .
tt was awesome .
no , thanks .
you saw mou@@ sey , right ? she did it .
and why would i wipe the poison clean , but leave my prints on the te@@ ap@@ ot ?
if you 'd wiped the pot , that would point to you .
it was me@@ gan , john .
that she sm@@ ir@@ ked at me as i was led away ?
oh , you don 't believe me ? do you blame me ?
you know , who the hell do you think i am ?
i want to know why you 're suddenly turning on me !
as@@ sh@@ ole
i want you to think about all the key moments in your life by tomorrow .
tine
why don 't you wanna help me ?
who 's there ?
i do
i just simply said i liked watching you sleep .
he was encouraging .. that place was so depressing
i 'm having trouble staying grounded .
you need to be objective , john .
you need to consider that this job is too big and too complex ...
whatever it is , i 'm gonna find out the truth .
i went through all the photos and one of them made me feel something
let 's begin ... . now .
t don ' remember his name .
why don 't you come here ... . next to me .
so , what happens now ?
this is the key to the house my parents lived in when i was born .
so many times in my life people have been un@@ kind .
will you keep this with you at all times ?
who 's on my side .
but i still feel trapped .
she has ... . significant difficulty .
basically , she has developed a protective shell
she inter@@ acts with the world in a completely different way than the way we do .
thank you so much , mr. washington .
and once we 've proven my innocence , we went back to that proof ..
because only then , were we able to actually see the truth .
how does it feel to be designated ?
i just downloaded it .
hello ? can you come over ?
anna , look , i need to talk to ..
something terrible has happened and i need to
you have reached the green@@ e 's residence .
confirm sea@@ hawk is in the blue zone , but con@@ dor is still in flight , right ?
we expect con@@ dor to land in an hour .
yes , ma 'am .
i 'm looking at a whole shelf of these ann@@ ab@@ ell dol@@ ls .
i have no idea what to buy her .
otherwise ...
moving now .
negative . wait for number three to arrive .
damn it . are they leaving ?
colonel , our intelligence only has them arriving in another half hour .
load up !
if these men leave now , in separate vehicles ..
we have only one eye in the sky .
intercept a suicide bomber on a city street ?
now that 's a guess , of course ,
we have done what we can for her in the time available to us .
we must strike now .
no , i 'm telling you . you need to take it to him .
i 'll leave you to sort that one out , jack .
no , i need that calculation to be below 50 % .
that calculation is already at the lowest limit of what i believe is possible .
i would still have to make that a 65 % possibility on the upper limit .
do you understand ?
we have to make a decision . there are ..
ma 'am .
i think if i make this the point of impact , then ..

seven years later ,

theod@@ ore will be all right sitting in the car .
just be you and me , sweetheart .
he was the only kid on the school bus who wasn 't somebody 's relation .
you 're coming out back with me today , boy .
second time .
them boys might be bigger than you .
you understand ?
now , you pray on what happened today .
fuck .
can i come with you ?
didn 't you hear anything i said ?
well ?
well , shut your mouth . we both know that ain 't never gonna happen .
it 's all right .
i know you 'd probably rather be doing something else .
len@@ ora ! ar@@ vin !
i 'll be praying for you .
my sister 's boy from down in tennessee
well , i would appreciate it if you all would try and make him feel welcome .
sure ..
and i see ..
and i suspect that the folks that carried them plat@@ ters in
but poor people ...
so them organs ..
telling me that i should ,
you 're saying you don 't ...
i 'm saying you must be crazy .
look , my advice to you , girl ...
oh , shoot .
you have to be patient with me while i get a few shots off .
the thought of killing carl and taking off with the boy in the back@@ seat
tell you what , son . why don 't you ste ...
no ! calm down , please !
i don 't want to shoot .
carl , you want sand@@ als or heels ?
serial mur@@ derers aren 't the most trusting kind .
poor sandy never stood a chance .
jim lac@@ ey .
carl never photographed a more symmetrical face .
jim had been their first .
who 's gonna bury jack ?
i don 't know who 's gonna wanna touch that thing .
my daddy didn 't do anything like what your daddy did up there ,
and there was nothing to do but forget his sorry ass .
ar@@ vin thought about the days leading up to his mother 's death ,
fuck the blood and stin@@ k , the heat and the insects .
ar@@ vin said to himself .
ar@@ vin russell !
sorry about that !
i ain 't here to hurt you !
come on out so we can have us a talk !
i figured this might be where you 'd come .
that was an awful thing your daddy did .
put the gun down , sheriff ! i got one pointed right at you !
i played as a school@@ boy , we got beat in the semi-@@ final .
so ' i was desperate to win it , absolutely desperate
we 'd be winning four , five , six-@@ il most weeks .
he 's scored !
one of the things that i remember is bu@@ tty 's overhead kick you know .
there was only going to be one result for this team , it was just
wasn 't right to do these kinds of things .
having coaches like no@@ bby that had done what he 'd done in football
having br@@ yan rob@@ son play in an a-@@ team game with me , next to me .
i 've seen gi@@ gg@@ sy and lee shar@@ pe and a few of the guys out and about in town
but it 's not our place to do that , is it ?
.he 's getting dressed .
bedroom just , you know , putting his jacket on .
hid in the wardrobe , they 've hid under the bed ,
of them jumped out ' the window .
so anyway , he 's caught me and shar@@ pe@@ y red-@@ handed .
and he was making body movements without even touching the ball .
i just saw him going through , going through , keeping on going .
look at sch@@ oles@@ y , look at sch@@ oles@@ y .
just for everything , how important it was ,
and throughout that season they all delivered .
but gi@@ gg@@ sy 's moment is the stand-@@ out moment .
look , who 's to know what 's going to happen in football , gary ?
those supporters will be talking about that for years .
that 's what football 's about .
we 're in a final , we 've got something in the bank for ourselves .
ii mean , the place went wild ,
watch the footage of sch@@ oles@@ y ... i got into the goal .
probably thinking , what am i doing ?
i think everyone that looks at us , they all think about .
west ham away .
the first year that we broke in properly was ' 95 ,
i wasn 't probably at that stage of my career where ti felt comfortable to sort of ,
i didn 't know whether it was going to@@ . be all right or not , you know ?
n 't know whether it was going to be all right or not , you know ?
you know , you 'd be
not intentionally .
well , a little , bit intentionally ,
.@@ so , if you were new , or i@@ f. you were a foreign player ,
we didn 't have the combinations between yor@@ ke and cole
and all of a sudden , with about 15 minutes to go ,
te@@ ddy came on . ole came on .
disaster for roy ke@@ ane .
if people ever sort of doubted , how good a player bu@@ tty was ,
what a guy .
ck to fundamentally what it was abo
you know , it should only be a matter of
it was like the game was over then .
as soon as the final whistle went
here we go . everybody , ready ? grab that . grab it .
too many people . get out .
she 's the best there is .
yeah , it makes me look like a complete mor@@ on
i 'm sorry , but suck it up .
it 's gonna be all right .
she has got a hole in her heart .
bypass would mean a lot of he@@ par@@ in .
she 's not stable enough to wait .
this is cal@@ lie , okay ?
yesterday we were at her stupid baby shower .
you can be cal@@ lie 's baby 's god@@ mother .
the only way to save the baby is to save cal@@ lie ,
i know it hurts .
don 't fight the intu@@ bation . this won 't take long .
with your eyes , okay ?
what about one finger ? can you move one finger ?
it 's too soon to tell anything .
she opened her eyes
derek , did she follow commands ?
no , nothing else .
both sta@@ b wounds to the chest ,
live for me .
you both love cal@@ lie .
what happened ?
belly 's tight as a drum .
abdominal compartment syndrome . she 's bleeding out .
we should say a prayer .
i haven 't stopped praying since yesterday .
remove the abdominal packs carefully .
we 've got blood !
we gotta go back in .
dr. al@@ t@@ man , we can still do the per@@ cutaneous repair .
dr. yang , the decision 's already made .
she 's well-@@ gro@@ omed , she has a job , works as a libr@@ arian ,
we can 't fully explain the phenomenon of ho@@ ar@@ ding .
and , in her case ?
for her , it 's about ... safeguarding memories .
family is everything .
think we found mr. santiago ?
maybe she didn 't want to spring for the ur@@ n .
it 's not the crime scene that 's bu@@ gging me .
well , look , nick , you 're talking about a woman here ,
there 's no excuse for this .
that 's your theory . i don 't think so .
and you guys can finish up this room .
well , i got a feeling this is not the last body
indications are male cauc@@ asian ,
this is some kind of twisted .
my understanding of it is that
you don 't think both daughters were being held here , do you ?
al@@ isa and the boys ...
so everything i heard is true .
well , the evidence indicates that she was here for a while
so i was able to recover
the owner fa@@ xed me the credit card receipt .
so what ? he also has a carry permit .
all the hard evidence points to mrs. santiago .
there were al@@ isa 's prints and her mother 's prints .
all right , what about the second boy ?
matthew price , six months ago .
we need to find that roll of ribbon .
you guys got a picture ?
go ahead , doctor .
stac@@ ked near the dresser .
it should be to the right of the window near the bed .
this could take till christmas .
meanwhile , back in the 21st century .
it 's not so bad , really .

oh , look , now he 's boring on an international scale .
is that who i think it is ? it can 't be .
shel@@ don , i owe you an apology .
i 've actually got a shot at a termin@@ ator .
when it comes to termin@@ ators ,
i have 11 hours with her in a confined space .
my money 's on tu@@ ck and roll .
i thought you-@@ were involved in some sort of
hang on a sec .
um , well , let 's see , couple reasons .
why do you have to give your paper to george smo@@ ot ?
so you 'll send him an e-mail when we get back .
righ@@ t. of course .
well , there 's nothing you can do about it , so relax .
only ten hours , 55 minutes to go .
must be summer .
okay , i 've found the perfect solution .
hello ?
i 'm about to give you a set of instructions ,
and the director is brilliant .
okay , great , i 'll see you then .

i 'm not in san francisco .

i wonder which reality show it is .
keep up .
sophie , thank you so much for letting us come up
that was another time i was on fire .
" kim gets a new hat . "
now that one 's a classic .
i like to go to sleep with the sound of kim 's voice .
" this is super awkward . "
it 's too bad we all didn 't live to see 20 .
you know i need someone to make me laugh .
stop !
that 's it , we 're done .
i know , i know , but we couldn 't stop
is the blonde one crying ?
can we please call it make-up remo@@ ver ?
it 's almost empty .
stop it ! just squeeze some out
please tell me it 's working .
i don 't think i can get your hair out .
who could that be ?
oh , we were just talking about you .
okay , tell me if this sounds familiar .
you push your way to the bar ,
meanwhile , she leaves with a guy who claims
what time should i be at your mother 's ?
i swear , that man is the most e@@ goti@@ s@@ tical ,
like bur@@ t and er@@ nie .
well , i 've had it . i am done .
where are you going to go ?
that 's a bit of an ethical con@@ und@@ rum .
so , uh , what 's your plan moving forward ?
what a task that will be .
you ready for breakfast ?
okay , ra@@ i , listen to me .
but i have a cream sher@@ ry han@@ go@@ ver
oh , howard , stop .
that 's how they get you .
i can leave whenever i want .
they 're on the chair , right over ..
she 's not gonna ba@@ the me , is she ?
all right , well , thanks again for helping me out .
should we go back and rescue him ?
we 'll see him at his bar mit@@ z@@ vah .
and she doesn 't know it .
they said i can go in the morning .
i want to be on the other side of it .
hi , son .
thanks , sir .
come on in .
hello ?
i got this number when i activated your new phone .
i 'm sorry . i don 't think i 'm going to .
who ?
what are you talking about ?
when you were in the hospital ,
they tracked me down using my cell phone ,
police haven 't been able to do a thing .
i get you don 't know where to turn ,
you want to get back at these guys ?
i mean , it has real resources ,
what 's that ?
because it came out of your head .
okay , i 'll throw it out .
what story ?
it 's hil@@ arious !
oh , look , there 's another hil@@ arious story !
i have hair extensions .
i murdered a man in rho@@ de island .
too bad it doesn 't give you depth .
is she sick ?
no , little you .
so where are they ? i checked all your dra@@ wers .
you already know the answer , so i 'm going back to sleep .
and all my pil@@ low@@ cases would have edges .
what was it like anyway ?
did caroline join a bowling team ?
aw , cra@@ p !
let her have some fun . what 's the big deal , square ?
it was a pil@@ low@@ case , and i need it to sleep .
in poland ,
what was it ?
give me the pills .
and , max , you were wrong . see ?
all right . take it easy .
why 'd he call you mrs. tuc@@ ker ?
no , seriously . w-@@ why is he m@@ essing with you ?
um , i told him how i would love to go
hold , please .
i don 't care .
oh , see , you said " i don 't care " twice .
why are you still here ?
here .
i just wanted a night alone , okay ?
so , go !
i didn 't say that .
and you 're not not being needy .
it 's already packed ?
bye . i love you . okay .
hi , honey .
oh ! wow . look at that .
well , i lost a dress and the house smells like smoke ,
right ?
either end the damn story or don 't even write it !
god , for a minute , i thought i missed something .
the chance to read a great book on your one night alone .
nice cut . perfectly cooked .
this training , it 's part of who i am about to become .
my name is di@@ mah tch@@ ak@@ ova .
it 's been kind of hard , but i think structure guides people .
no , i don 't think it 's too severe .
it 's not a game .
i need to be good at this , because i believe in this war .
i can 't really say stuff like that at this school ,
i think they 're selfish .
it 's not right .
being a squad leader means i am their leader .
they call me " the robot " behind my back , but i don 't mind .
i don 't think we 're supposed to fit in
i feel like i 'm meant to be here .
being a soldier isn 't about min@@ dless violence .
would i be able to take another life ?
after all , it 's kill or be killed .
i don 't think i could kill another human being ever .
we 've been floating aim@@ lessly in space
over four years aboard this ship with nothing to do ,
for four years , all i 've done is think .
i hate you .
we are at war with insurrec@@ tion@@ ists ,
every single one of you at this academy was sent here
well , what are you waiting for ?
oni 's hiding stuff from us , i 'm positive .
stop stepping on our dic@@ ks , las@@ ky !
nah , sul@@ ly , vic@@ kers is right .
don 't bother , j@@ j . he 's gone soft .
all right , you 're especially gonna love this .
we see this river , me and the boys ,
yeah , i did .
i almost ruined my body suit a couple times ,
volcano ! volcano !
the strategy used in earth 's second pun@@ ic war
it does seem a little basic .
why ?
never underestimate your opponents .
questions ?
yeah , we don 't have horses .
what happened ?
my chest feels like it 's on fire .
it 's a drug we inject to keep ice crystals
so i won 't be able to breathe every time i wake up from cry@@ o sleep .
i 'll know more in a few hours .
yes , sir .
hey , br@@ o .
it 's day , uh ...
i 'm doing real good work here .
rich didn 't make it .
he was right there next to me and then ...
a pine@@ apple sent him flying in four different directions .
he said it 'd make me look tougher .
i got to go , br@@ o .
what matters is that our soldiers
cade@@ t las@@ ky ?
how are you feeling ?
this is for you .
i don 't understand , sir .
if you feel that you are unfit for service ,
tomorrow .
at the end of the game ,
all of his squad perished .
there are no remains to bury .
colonel las@@ ky out .
las@@ ky , move over . i gotta show you something .
no , it 's important .
it 's offline .
they must have flag@@ ged those com@@ s .
that sounded close !
what the hell 's invisible ?
it 's coming . we got to get out of here !
where are we gonna go ?
but really , you 're not .
they just look like you .
we 'll shake hands
well , i 'm 28 .
oh , i 'm terribly sorry .
thank ou .
now , i come back the next year and i have no idea where i am .
i suppose we 're rather old-fashioned .
i like it . it 's comfor@@ ting .
i 'll leave my card for you on the table here .
hadn 't forgotten the schedule .
we 'll see you tomorrow morning .
is there anyone at the stage door ?
that 's okay . i 'll just go .
i 'll see you tomorrow .
it 's a prime slot , so ...
of the three of us , i was by far the most supportive .
how will ra@@ i ever reach true greatness
okay , let 's try it this way .
i had not considered that .
oh , sorry .
something more suited to your status .
how about if i put you in von ger@@ l@@ ich 's old office ?
damn , this is hard .
what do you think the business of this place is ?
and this boy 's picture in people magazine
who doesn 't ?
i didn 't even know there was a president 's dining room .
come on , little buddy .
see you tonight , guys .
so anyway , after a fantastic lunch ,
u@@ h-@@ u@@ h. no .
apparently , the camera loves me and i , lit
right , a ball of hot , fl@@ aming gas
oh , it 's my assistant , tre@@ vor .
they gave him an assistant
not yet .
okay@@ . so , saturday night , can i count on my pos@@ se ?
oh , okay@@ . leonard ?
shel@@ don ?
a tremendous accomplishment would be
i 'd go to that reception .
raj is gonna be in people magazine ,
of course i would .
shame on you guys .
i can 't believe it took you a whole year .
i 'm going to be in people magazine .
i have a lim@@ o . i just love saying " lim@@ o . "
um , yeah. why , what 's wrong with it ?
it can 't be racist .
let 's just eat so i can get to bed .
did you remember to ask
y@@ es. brown rice , not white ?
did you pick up the low sodium soy sauce from the market ?
fine .
i want you to check before you accept the order .
that may well be ,
they could be mur@@ derers or the carriers of unusual pathogens .
if we do get a new friend ,
i 'll draw up an order and get it before a judge .
how ?
security camera only shows sara stepping up and firing at the victim .
that 's the least you could do ...
goodbye , theod@@ ore .
after the mothers come back here , the depression 's almost unbearable .
it 's less messy , if you just think of yourself as a surro@@ gate .
michael , it 's blue phillips .
someone tried to poison her .
but leave sar@@ o alone .
.. if you were killed , your pain would last a moment .
now , that 's got to be appealing to whoever put out this hit .
.... if i find out anything , i 'll be sure to let you know .
i remember you have two missing toes that can attest to that fact .
please .
if i grant her , everybody 's gonna want one .
is there something i should know about the structural integrity of the shu ?
let 's move on , shall we ?
.. as special agent in the federal bureau of investigation .
thank you for the invite .
you know , alex , this ruling can be revisited ...
are you kidding me ?
shut up and don 't bring it up again . what 's all that ?
covering seven different escape attempts ..
no , i didn 't put her in prison . the state of florida did .
so where 's all your little bud@@ dies ?
what else did you get ?
motor pool is here .
if she understood my letter , she 'll find a way to tell me .
attention all inmates . visiting hours will be over in five minutes .
tell me you completed your assignment .
the woman we hired is having trouble getting near sara tan@@ cred@@ i .
careful i don 't get there first ..
all right , from take off , the prison 's gonna come up real fast .
you got it .
good . that means t-@@ bag 's set .
it 's not my first time inside prison .
think about all the amazing stories you 'll be able to tell your kid .
someone to look up to .
unless you 've got details i 'm hanging up . you can forget getting your badge back .
i was worried about my little girl on the outside .
see if someone will watch over her .
yes , sir .
you think su@@ cre made the drop on time ?
no , no , no .
three , four , eight , pound .
and i know exactly how he 's gonna do it .
just light a fire in my cell and the rest will just take care of itself .
if anybody so much as ben@@ ds a blade of grass in this place ..
what are we waiting for ?
for the right price , t-@@ bag would set off the fire al@@ arms .
so you used to do business with sleepy ?
old bast@@ ard smoked all the time .
accidentally .
you were always running around here ,
let 's get you a gun , yeah ?
i 'll take it . and a sup@@ pres@@ sor if you 've got one .
but it turns out you would 've .

hi , i 'm caroline and this is my business partner max .

the launch systems on the missiles are a bit 1980s .
we 're trying to stop it .
just a handful of senators , congres@@ smen ,
we bring her down ,
because the way we 're going to bring her down is ...
an n@@ sa analyst sympathetic
if it 's transmitted , it goes through ec@@ hel@@ on .
okay .
this is not about mic@@ h@@ gel this is about your father .
we need it back .
i didn 't , no , for what that 's worth .
then why don 't you open the gate ?
before your shoes get dirty .
it 's a place he referred to as " bol@@ sho@@ i boo@@ ze . "
what does it mean ?
you 'll need to figure it out
open the gate .
i want to hear it .
i 'll get sco@@ field
li@@ just hope you 're properly motivated .
she 's all right .
i 'll , uh ...

you have no idea how hard it is to get this kind of grade .
it 's time for your end of the deal .
they call me a couple of hours before with the drop-@@ off point .
since it 's going to be a while ,
they 're my cousins .
what did he tell you ?
good .
now , there 's a half an hour between when your father landed
i don 't do this every day .
move on .
il k@@ how who you are .
you don 't have to worry
this is all for your brother ?
i got four brothers , two in prison .
but break them out ? loc@@ o .
let 's get this party started .

i 've seen him before .
been trying to work out what kind of man aban@@ dons his family .
you 'll see him again .
how much further ?
when 's your brother getting here ?
when 's he supposed to meet you here ? !
are you that surprised that there are people in the world
sad .
don 't worry i 'll talk you through it .
hell no .
he 'll never make it like this@@ .he should have thought
please .
fin@@ ley road ...
i know things got kind of ugly toward the .

nas@@ i go@@ ren@@ g . fried rice . good for you .
he uses a remote detonation , right ?

why ? and how ?
but " why , " haven 't figured out yet .
you say it involved my daughter ?
her necklace ?
tra@@ vers . fbi . kidnapping squad .
you were too busy talking ..
i was trying to figure out what they know .
even the sul@@ tana 's body must be viewed by the next of kin .
mr. f@@ bi-@@ kid@@ n@@ app@@ ing-@@ expert .
the cops . while they wait for a ransom .
like the key respect , that the sultan refused to talk before the vi@@ zi@@ er .
because when i kissed his hand , he gave me this .
it 's fine if you want to cry , sul@@ tana .
there .
who are you ? really .
we are doing this right now .
it 's hard , man . he followed me everywhere , you know ?

k@@ gb needs smart agents who can size up situations ,
she has been trained with that in mind .
she 's highly intelligent .
" like a captive cast to the bottom of a deep , dry well ,
che@@ kho@@ v .
that 's what 's important .
yeah , another time .
that 's what i do . only nobody pays me .
i 'm expected to find five or six girls each trip ,
you 're doing it wrong , my friend .
we look for something unique . pearls . g@@ ems .
not even in moscow .
no leverage .
she has been well trained .
" attackers may sometimes regret bad moves ,

one in training , one on mission .
or i can go anywhere i want ?
with all due respect ,
he 's divorced , no kids .
he can 't be bought . so we have no leverage for blackmail .
let me guess .
we 've already sorted things out on that end .
where is the piece ?
there will be no back@@ ups . so if there 's a hit@@ ch ..
bring me the att@@ ache case , keys ,
which room ?
yeah , i 've read it .

ho@@ f@@ stra ? hello ?

i mis@@ judged that and i am really sorry .
suddenly he 's singing his heart out on the edge of the earth
he loved it up here .
he loved you and you 're from up here .

han@@ nah , there is grief and then there is worship .
i paid you everything i had left .

would miss stell@@ a do us the honor
well . you 're not gonna believe this .
well , if they 're coming , does that mean

just take your time changing your clothes .
you 're hil@@ arious .
congratulations , hal@@ ey .
sorry . honey , i know you 're a little annoyed .
i 'm a lot annoyed .
this way , you 'll be surrounded by people who love you .
congratulations ! i am so happy for you .
uh , this is ann@@ ab@@ elle .
well , then i 'll cook .
i think breaking bread together would be a great stant .
you know , i don 't really even need a flash@@ light .
what was that ?
anyway , where is your sense of romance ?
you have a defen@@ seless lady .
yeah , well , i don 't need to ask your permission .
get your hands off me you big ape !
i 'm gonna sue your ass !
well , what are we waiting for ?
i 'm not a well woman .
your friend 's afraid the stuff in her free@@ zer is gonna spoil .
now she won 't have to worry .
eat ' em while they 're hot .
oh , you don 't wanna marry her .
no , no , no .
come on . what gives ?
getting divorced really kicked my ass .
next time i get married , i 've gotta be sure .
we can 't use yours .
though reluctant at first , carlos soon saw the wisdom in edi@@ e s plan .
the three keys to success are ..
but it 's gonna be worth it .
they 're a little revealing .
okay ... yeah .
yeah , especially that one .
it sof@@ tens up the ambi@@ ence .
oh@@ .@@ oh , my god .
great@@ .@@ uh ... just be sure to run it by tom .
was . she has been dry for weeks now .
but mil@@ ky@@ - white 's my best friend !
the special beans
and when your mother died ,
i 'm so sorry . i 'm so sorry .
because everyone in this village knows
go to the wood and bring me back ...
two , the cape as red as blood .
four , the slip@@ per as pure as gold .
" tis then the blue moon re@@ appears ,
go to the wood
the f '@@ esti@@ val ?
surely , you can let me be there for one of them .
you 're missing all the flowers
you frightened me !
how am i supposed to get it ?
i can 't just take a cloak from a little girl .
it 's the rules .
i 'm not allowed to touch any of the objects .
hello there , little girl .
have you saved some of those sweets for gran@@ ny ?
i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry . i just wanted to make sure
i 'd rather a wolf than you any day !
i 'm never gonna find that red cape ,
the cow as white as milk
you need to be more careful , young lady .
t should have known better .
once his teeth were ba@@ red , though i really got scared
maybe gran@@ ny will make me another one out of the skins of that wolf .
but they 're magic . the man said .
mother , no !
you and your worthless adventures , jack ! will you never learn ?
beans !
the prince danced only with her ,
quickly !
are you all right , miss ? yes .
oh , what a beautiful gown !
we were just about to do that ,
i can 't touch it , remember
i don 't like that woman .
why does she run from me ?
agony
you are everything ma@@ id@@ ens could wish for
let down your hair to me .
perhaps it will take two of us to have this child .
tt takes two
oh , brilliant ! my mil@@ k@@ y-@@ white !
where did you get this ?
a golden egg . i 've never seen a golden egg before .
what five gold pieces ?
you could not , mr. liar !
jack took the little girl 's dare ,
we had no food to eat ,
you leave my boy alone !
be quiet , woman , or you 'll get us all killed !
.. destroying everything in your path !
you 're just a big bully !
you 'll never , never , ever ..
the boy is hiding in the stee@@ ple tower !
there 's a giant terror@@ izing the kingdom .
the prince ?
what ?
oh , my ! you are the .
i had to disguise myself
i mean , you 'll be safe in our company .
it 's this way . my wife is somewhere .
now i must go off to sl@@ ay a giant .
and how alive you 've made me feel .
was that me ? was that him ?
and kiss me ? and kiss me ?
there 's the answer , if you 're clever
is it always " or " ? is it never " and " ?
and to get what you wish only just for a moment
lost the beans again punish me the way you did then
maybe i shouldn 't have stra@@ yed from the path .
yeah , maybe you shouldn 't have .
away from here .
it doesn 't matter if we 're together or we 're apart .
you don 't understand !
she was the one who helped .
he 'll be happier in the arms of a princess .
i thought that if you were mine ,
i think you should go .
my father 's house was a nightmare .
i couldn 't agree more .
greg p@@ ember@@ ton , you old so-@@ and-@@ so .
uh , let me introduce you to my colleague , dr. campbell .
great to meet you . well , you have my number .
nothing beats a lap dance and a baked potato bar , huh ?
that 's a hard pass .
good to see you . barry .
god , i hate that guy .
i@@ was only being polite . p@@ ember@@ ton is a grade a we@@ as@@ el .
have literally never said that to you .
p@@ ember@@ ton 's whole m.@@ o .
that 's exactly what he 's doing to us .
you want proof ? i can make some calls .
i really don 't want to see that guy win a nobel .
o@@ oh , this is tricky .
well , let me know if you change your mind .
so i was talking to my mom
apparently , old testament god would bring down his wrath
you know , i asked her that very question .
sure , what 's up ?
if we have damaging and embarrassing information about someone ,
i know all about your tall girl website .
it 's dr. p@@ ember@@ ton .
wow . well , that 's not gonna sit well with the nobel committee .
relax , he said it 's not you .
okay , now you just sound crazy .
it wouldn 't just knock p@@ ember@@ ton
okay ? we@@ -@@ we know it wasn 't penny ,
how do we know it wasn 't susan ?
don 't make me say it .
the cars they drove , the color of their eyes ,
you sure you 're not thinking about your husband ?
almost like he was guilty or something .
i mean , leonard has resting guilt face .
then why are you acting guilty now ?
but that just means you didn 't do anything wrong ,
now that i know , i 'm implicated .
i also wanted you to be my je@@ ster
there was only one princess , and it was me !
shel@@ don , if someone were gonna do something
can 't help myself ; i 'm a fact ad@@ dict .
and that 's a fact .
what ? you told him ?
that 's the point . i 'm doing it .
well , so is you and amy not getting
but we 're not .
it could be both .
but i 'm gonna go with my reason . yours is too complicated .
okay .
ho@@ wi@@ e .
w-@@ while i was there , i started asking myself ,
and i just wanted you to know that .
because the only woman i want to creep out
thank you for meeting us .
we never say no when someone wants to buy us lunch .
really ? apologies go down easier
there 's something we have to give you .
uh , we have proof that you pl@@ agi@@ arized your thesis .
go ahead .
i don 't want him spreading this thing if it 's contagious .
like that , someone can play god to you .
invisible , like a mal@@ evol@@ ent for@@ te beyond the fir@@ ma@@ ment .
find out if it gets us ?
but if we 're not showing symptoms at this point , we might be in the clear .
c amos .
what do you got ?
it 's not affecting other species .
it 's not a compound .
makes it something no one 's ever seen .
covenant 's found their holy gra@@ il , then , haven 't they ?
when we 're supposedly not even at war .
why not hit population centers like gan@@ nick 22 ?
told to carry some things to a landing site and not to ask any questions .
he couldn 't find out what he was carrying ,
a place so doomed even the elite ze@@ alo@@ ts won 't go there .
if we work backward through the tu@@ gs positioning ,
half a dozen char@@ red planets around it , but that 's not the interesting part .
that 's alpha halo .
the weapon master chief destroyed .
be a major peace violation if anyone went there .
you think this is where they 're sourcing the element ?
before the explosion .
you got a point , private , get to it .
element range 120 to 130 .
expand search .
looks like we got a one-off .
native to this little piece of halo ring and nowhere else .
launch it from a destroyer .
what do you got , e@@ str@@ in ?
looks like someone 's going back to no man 's land .
and no one walks away from the spart@@ an program .
fast forward 10 years and suddenly i 'm looking at your colonel .
except his name is not ran@@ d@@ all , it 's ai@@ ken .
let 's make this easy , huh ?
shut up and save the bull for the ride out .
wh@@ oa there , boy . wh@@ oa !
hell is going on , mac@@ er ?
talk to me , con@@ dor . what the hell is going on ?
it 's your technology !
they sense it !
we 've learned not to bring technology to this place .
these people don 't know how to react , brother .
maybe that 'll be the thing that kills you .
we got a problem .
and with that con@@ dor down at the bottom of the canyon ,
and in five hours and change , that sun is coming up ,
there 's still the tu@@ g .
and there are nine of us
that 's a given .
that fav@@ ol survived the fall
now we go down to the con@@ dor ,
two hours down , two hours to the tu@@ g
j@@ life@@ boat rules
that 's a dangerous game you 're playing
must not be carbon-@@ based life .
halo ring ? i don 't put anything past it .
they 're b@@ aiting us .
yeah , they 're too close , and we 're going nowhere with him .
i 'm tired of listening to you .
you 'd take that chance ?
you got one more second , loc@@ ke .
doesn 't have to be like this .
i 'm not the one who needs saving
you know where i stand .
might be all you have to make , mac@@ er .
he 'll turn on you , huh ?
the least essential one always dies .
you 're telling me this why ?
so you could teach me ?
football .
if you want to blend in with penny 's friends ,
put the gun down now !
would be considered an act of war .
by the chinese air force .
dr. hen@@ ning .
scared for myself and my family .
i 'm not a machine . you 're not making sense .
a hospital corridor or a donkey 's ass ?
blue . i '@@ l take the corridor .
area 6 is restricted to in@@ patients only .
oh , jesus !
i .. i don 't know what you 're talking about . who has your son ?
i don 't know . i don 't know anything about this place .
stop ! don 't do that .
let go of me !
he was a soldier .
the poor woman . yeah .
even if they know deep down that it 's hopeless .
she needs help . m@@ m-@@ hmm .
all right ? i 'll show you around . sounds good .
hello , ava . very pleased to have you join our team .
we 're all very excited to
oh , i know .
yes . that was shortly after you turned down the job at the n.@@ s.@@ a .
not really . i mean , c@@ x@@ t made a better offer .
i think we can all be forgiven for a little youthful exu@@ ber@@ ance
what 's this cover for ?
it 's naturally clear ,
yes , we want machines that can manage a three-@@ block war
eventually it will look and
and it will look pakistani or chinese or .
it 's incredible
um , of course you can .
um , the carbon-@@ fiber muscles are extremely strong .
or just another one of those fre@@ aks .
there you go .
weapons for the government .
why do they have those c@@ res@@ cent@@ -@@ shaped scars
i think that she is still angry with you , vincent .
i just want to congratulate you on the turing test .
machine . how can we win a war against china ?
when they are all dead , civil unrest will tear the country apart .
why don 't you just leave ?
my daughter has rett syndrome .
so you 've been using the
so it is a girl ?
don 't want some confused lad@@ y-@@ boy robot on our hands .
thank you .
they are alive .
you can 't see their thoughts .
you okay in there , sir ?
are you sure ?
now , i , uh ... i have to get back to my work .
don 't be shy .
i 've got a secret to tell you . do you want to hear it ?
all you have to do is open that file .
okay .
isn 't this fun ?
if we took off those handcu@@ ffs and let him go ,
we have to let him go eventually .
i wouldn 't let him . i would stop him .
i would shout at him .
go on . try .
you could hurt him .
i want to believe .
if you asked me to trust you , i would .
yes ?
oh . right . when does she go into surgery ?
but he 's a lying bast@@ ard . it 's just a backup to it 's g.@@ p.@@ s .
because the bomb doesn 't work without it .
shut down the base . kill the machine and vincent on sight .
the soldiers can speak
their words are evolved , efficient .
because they are part of the new world ,
to save my daughter 's program .
come on , we 're in the middle of a great story .
it 's time to 20 to bed .
and that 's my brother , london .
but you always knew one of us had to go .
come on , lon . aren 't you gonna eat anything ?
does that mean that you 're going instead ?
partner , i have to go .
time 's up , priv@@ ates .
you take care of yourself , okay ?
i 'm not a mid@@ get , right ?
i 'm afraid your son had something to do with the nickname .
that 's okay , pepper .
any news from james ?
you know , it 's really too soon to make any type of diagnosis .
but for now , fe@@ pper , let 's just say you 're a .
te@@ ac@@ up !
mr. jones y@@ elled at me yesterday .
he said you were a ..
what d waste .
yes , he has .
hi , jenny . can i have two tickets for the " ben eagle show " ?
yeah , he should be here soon . bye , jenny . thank you .
on march 11th , your husband ,
i can 't wait to see him . he 's the best .
they seem harmless , don 't they ? but can we trust them ?
everything okay here ?
those j@@ ads took his life .
we need to do something about that j@@ ap .
you want to smash him with your bare hands , huh ?
go on .
take that , dirty j@@ ap !
why don 't you try again ?
there , it moved .
yes , because you moved me to move it .
and that , you could say , is how faith works .
and this is as much as i need to move a mountain ?
but it 's up to him .
for centuries , people believed that if you do this list ,
" feed the hungry ,
" visit the sick ,
so , were you nice to him ?
take him a gift , as a peace offering .
want a soda ?
oh , i think you 'll be okay .
ol@@ lie , why are you getting me involved in this ?
yes , yes , he did ,
oh , no , he 's back again .
stand

i 've just seen rod in li@@ d@@ co@@ te .
i 'm concerned about his state of mind .
last night he came up to my room so upset .
war shock .

this business seems almost contagious .
one time there was this fashion for fain@@ ting .
that 's just it .
caroline has begun to believe
and it 's madness , i know , but ..
what exactly are you saying ?
you 're suggesting
become mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous or mal@@ ign .
isn 't that the old theory
then there isn 't an ounce of science in it .
well , she can 't be allowed to remain all alone
she has me .
get caroline out .
it 's all right .
we had such fun here in the old days .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
how would she know i 'm gay ?
cam has this crazy theory that if he were straight ..
they 'd be dating .

there 's no breaking that bond now .
dr. fin@@ cher thinks that it 's best that you stay with hol@@ ly ,
hol@@ ly spent the last 12 years
whatever she wants , she gets ,
okay .
what was i supposed to say .
did they really think that this would work ?
no , i think that they are just trying to help you remember
that they didn 't want me ,
because i was too old and used up
we will then repair ,
we hope
it 's a very complicated situation .
it 's not complicated at all .
the guy 's a monster who stole our kid for 12 years ,
she 'll need all of us to abide by her wishes ,
she doesn 't know what she wants .
but she still has feelings of blame and resentment
did she remember ?
she didn 't remember .
she 'll come back to you .
you just have to be patient .
um , i haven 't heard back yet from northwestern ,
uh , yes , he said your resume was impressive .
keep your options open , though .
he also said he wasn 't sure
you don 't just get over something like that .
adel@@ e , baby .
that should just about do it .
most of our candidates can 't get the detail
which reminds me ,
you 're a name brand .
who cares if that 's why they want you ?
oh , oh , oh , she 's going for the soup .
she 's looking good . looking confident .
why do you do that ,
what i 've been through is being ...
and i mean , i get it , but ...
and i didn 't get to talk to him
no , i can 't .
we got to move .
you put in all that work , break out of prison ,
so which one of them was it ?
free clinics ?
the brothers come in for medical ,
eyes and ears on the families .
what 's the hardest thing in the world for a con to do ?
few things in life are certain , ms ... ?
needing distance , he 'll steal a car .
we didn 't have a choice .
i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry .
when i saw you on the news , i was worried .
so did i .
see if you can find him some clean clothes .
i got to go back and get our car .
we can get another .
because in that car is everything we need to disappear .
here we go boss , one of the blues
looks like we got our first mistake .
to be honest roy i could 've done
like a little girl you bite me .
yeah , probably did .
you want someone to blame , how about those convicts
when they went over that wall ,
see that reward they got ?
not for long .
i mean somebody 's going to get that money might as well be me .
you really think i 'm going to split that reward with you ?
of course . i 'll keep an eye on her .
and be on your way .
brew@@ ster 's to@@ wing .
who am i speaking with ?
okay , chuck , i want to alert you to a possible situation .
an individual may be coming there to inquire about a vehicle .
has anyone come by looking for a vehicle that matches that description ?
when ?
chuck .
especially when i have no idea whose " side " you 're on .
somebody is going to go down because of what happened at fox river .
and to ensure this , certain steps need to be taken .
two :
everything you know about how that prison was being run .
i can 't do that .
we 're on our way there .
we just got this from surveillance .
someone just left a message on it .
sco@@ field .
something about a meeting , if sounded like he was
as long as it 's turned on ..
don 't do anything stupid . don 't do anything stupid
do you know why i pulled you over today , sir ?
let me see your license and registration please ?
come on , man . it 's a 1952 ural motor@@ bike , br@@ o
she 's the love of my life , br@@ o .
you look like hell .
over the years , l 've worked with ..
i would tell them that i could understand
i used to be an ad@@ dict , too .
but if you want to be an architect ,
i obviously can 't .
chocolate gel@@ ato from that place you like .
it 's in the free@@ zer .
listen , man , i 'm sorry .
l understand you 're frustrated . i get frustrated , too .
we have our limitations , but ...
but if you think about it ,
thanks for this by the way . this is really good .
feel better , man . don 't worry about it .
i 'm not john , i 'm his brother .
can you just leave , please ?
it 's his phone .
can you just leave ?
john and i are brothers , but we share the same body .
inside of me .
it 's extremely rare , but it exists .
i 'm conscious from 7 : 00 a.m. to 7 : 00 p.m .
you know what , i 've heard some really crazy shit in my time ,
welcome to our online store .
that 's when it hit me .
yes . from home , our subscribers can pick a certain cut of salmon ,
and expands our profits nicely .
monday m@@ oms ?
this was all maya 's idea .
you would think management would want someone from sales in that position
he 's what ?
why would you tell me that ?
anyway , it shouldn 't be a surprise . you guys have been together for five year
and that 's a bad thing because .. ?
okay , how do i say this nicely ?
how about this ? tonight , you get mess@@ ed up .
what party ?
uh , well , off the top of my head , um ...
im ...
but your skin@@ care line is .
a little behind the competition .
you launched your av@@ oc@@ ado jo@@ job@@ a line last spring and we only sold 1,3@@ 53 unit ,
can i talk to you in private ?
well ...
are you kidding me ?
i realize that my ..
did you create a facebook page for maya ?
yes .
but it wasn 't just facebook .
this is a work of art .
nice and high , so i can count .
calling it " m@@ oms " is sexist against men .
you 're a little stupid , aren 't you ?
yeah . yeah , i 'll be happy if we make the tournament , but .
they don 't have the best assistant coach in the country .
perfect .
i just , i can 't believe you said yes .
i know , my head is still spinning .
look , i admit that the way i got in was less than honest , but
okay . i 'm happy for you , ba@@ be .
he@@ y. go with plan anything other than that .
wipe that face off your face . mis@@ sy thing . okay ?
come on , let 's do this , girls .
i 'll see you guys tomorrow .
well , that worked out .
okay .
but it 's made him who he is .
i worry about some of his decisions ..
i 'm sorry .
although i finally talked him into putting the apartment on z@@ il@@ low .
he 's a dad . that 's what they do , right ?
my grandmother raised me until .
something like that .
first shot at initial proto@@ types .
we have to find the ingredients in nature .
do you have a minute , sir ? oh , come on !
are you okay ?
damn it !
z@@ c@@ ward taylor 's office .

woo ! that was really cold !
you did all this in the field ?
thank you . that actually worked out great .
well , ron is one of the reasons i hate this job sometimes .
honestly ?
should have kept my big mouth shut .
took a run at it a few years ago .
if you don 't mind helping me search for it ,
yeah , well , it 's the least i can do for you making ron look like a dick .
but it was just a series of dead ends , so i sort of gave u@@ o .
that was a good decision .
oh , my god .
you know , the adoption agency advised me not to .
but i was .... . 16 .
but i knew you had to be born .
i found my old research !
well , i took out the really good stuff ,
so , that 's where you 've been ?
for gi@@ od 's sake , would you please start cur@@ sing ?
so , what is she like ?
just last week , she was t@@ north korea .
that 's a sh@@ it@@ ty thing to say .
you know what ? you have no idea what it 's been like .
how many times i still thought about her every day .
i 'm a mess . and , you know what , i hate the lie .
i could lose her again .
you act like you don 't have a choice .
well ...
because she was pretty amazing .
he@@ y. don 't be a stranger , huh ?
but it comes with a price .
oh , just give me that .
to make all three products entirely green from the tang@@ er@@ ine extract ,
change often comes at a cost .
well , maybe you could ask them for more time .
what you said we could .
oh , look who 's back from the city .
they fire you ?
nine weeks of work and i ..
everything happens for a reason , right .
there 's just .
oh , tell me about it .
why did felix ban@@ ish you ?
he wanted me to hide the fact that we were re@@ packaging sham@@ poo
so he let you keep your job if you kept your mouth shut ,
that 's what he wants .
hey .
thank you .
two of the most beautiful people here .
right .

hey , everyone , i want to thank you all for coming
cheers to me .

i thought it was me you were hesitant about .
l thought i didn 't deserve to ..
i should have told you .
you let me fall in love with a version of you .
you were always good enough .
you 're the only one that ever doubted it .
that ? now ?
is everything okay ?
do you miss it ?
but my dad needs me .
have you thought about going back to school ?
yeah , but we can still
nothing . just ..

l guess i was afraid to be .
here 's to us working together .
our company .
2@@ oe .
was that a lie , too ?
well , how can i trust anything you say ?
i got my wish .
but i realized something .
ts a cute deal .
if we 'd only done it differently .
i mean ,
two of them left me .
and all of this i could bear as long as i had my girl@@ friends .
everything i touch ..
well , on that note , i think i 'll call it a night .
you don 't have to rub it in , ly@@ net@@ te .
wait . i 've got an idea .
well , i 'm sure you can fix that .
but they all seem to hate me .
jimmy , we 're only doing this because we love you .

okay , you can take him for shoes .
well , all i know is he says they hurt his feet .
well , he heard me making plans on the phone ..
all right .
i don 't want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste .
and the more cards you see ..
they 're taking us home tomorrow on a plane .
how are we doing here ?
keeping him updated .
he doesn 't need that kind of pressure right now .
they 're coming back .
they 're gonna be fine .
how long are we saying that this is okay ?
i , for one , find it refreshing .
she never has anything nice to say .
i said no more damn restraints !
she doesn 't even belong on this floor .
she belongs up in psy@@ ch .
don 't tell me where she belongs .
okay .
it 's time to get up .

well , you know , a part of me wishes it hadn 't .
and you should not look back . go .

your person is you , and it always has been .
hold my hand .
usually when i talk to him , i sense that he 's there ,
that 's not gonna happen tonight .
if he starts going south , i 'll tell him to cut it out .
thank you .

and that is definitely not how i talk to patient .
we 're in the business
she 's a person on the precip@@ ice of change , a@@ very .
god , the things we worry about .
and we get to help take that worry away .
it 's actually why we 're people ,
we control that , a@@ very
and i didn 't like myself for it ,
i only went on that plane because i was pis@@ sed at you .
i 'm only here because he 's so selfish and thought@@ less .

would you get out of my room ,
hey . we just had lunch ,
you need to take her to the park more .
she 's indoors all day .

reputation , mr. ca@@ hill , is an idle impression ,
can you handle it ?

i 'm sorry , michael ...
mike , it 's 20 past three . we 're out of time .

to the public , this would be one man , to be blunt , of questionable popularity
if she isn 't , he 'll kill her and upload the video .
the mood will border on insurrec@@ tion and you will be destroyed ,
the public , the palace and the party insist on compliance .
refuse , and i 've been advised
but ...
and now appears to be heading west to bank@@ side studios .
after midnight , it 'll be a criminal offence
... when public opinion has very much hardened ,
... an unprecedented nature .
in a few minutes ,
recording or possessing
the broadcast will commence after the following tone .
so you 'll have to keep going .

hello ?
that depends who this is .

i have a lot of people who work for me .
of course not . though what i can 't quite figure
that is what the hotel is saying
you 're a quick study .
once the deal is made , the deal never changes .
the deal is for one passenger .
any packages ?
weight ?
is that a problem ? i was told that you can transport anything
it 's me . he left . you can proceed

but it 's 200 euros
hello , junior .

that 's great , dad .
wanna make a new deal .
you haven 't heard the terms yet .
they 're really very simple .
i wouldn 't do that if i were you . that touches your skin ,
soup to nuts , it will kill a man in 12 hours .
you could do that , but you 'd be killing your father along with us .
you don 't , he dies .
did i ever lie to you ?
i got all the girls that most fit the description on the video .
they love their oec@@ c@@ itan .
i know the bas@@ ou@@ e country well .

we 're gonna find out . all right . let 's try .
okay , hold on .
let 's get the hell out of here .
do you have any idea how to get us out of here ?

okay .
all right . take the rod off one of those clothes racks
see how many cob@@ web@@ s you can get on there .
put some pressure on that , would you , junior ?
no one 's dying today .
how did this happen ?
it 's some kind of medical grade anes@@ thetic .
one part i can 't quite figure out though is
well
i 'm sorry i lied to you about the poison .
i 'm sorry about that , too .
very wrong
i think i have a good idea .
how did you get caught up in all of this ?
drinking and drugs killed the people that guns didn 't .
i think she could have gotten $ 600 , right ?
you can still walk away .
do you know what it feels like to be thought of as trash ?
without thinking about it .
really ?
the only thing different between this year and last
is this where we get our hand stamped ?
uh , wh@@ y-@@ why are you here ?
let 's go get our seats .

you told her we have boundaries ?
okay , i feel like this tea 's getting away from us .

and believe me , when food goes in that mouth ,
first of all , no one can replace me as a son .
i have an insulin pump .
a grown man in his 3@@ 0s living with my mother .
he needs a place to stay .
and even if there was , who cares ?
" who cares " ? ! you wouldn 't care
i give you my blessing .
i 'm just gonna call my mother and be honest with her .

don 't forget it .
the very stability of our country is under threat .
one would ask why you are fighting a war in africa .
especially in the colonies .
i suspect one shouldn 't occupy a princess with such ... . matters .
of course .
perhaps if it was the european way ,
i need her husband 's political support .
hit@@ ch@@ cock offered me a role
i wanted to ask you .
but would it be appropriate ?
why would they say that ?
i am going to make a film for mr alfred hit@@ ch@@ cock .
try not to look too astonished .
it 's not the stage , it 's the screen .
yes , what about your duties ma 'am , and the crisis ?
monsieur cor@@ net ! i can be a mother and a wife ,

why does everything have to be so complicated ?
in 15 minutes , ray is going to ask de ga@@ ul@@ le to come to the negotiating table .

tu@@ ck
grace kelly , movie star ?
ray , come along ust talk to the woman .
i don 't know how .. i don 't know how to speak to her !

very good .
louis xiv tried to take monaco , but failed
your highness .

the red cross means a lot to her mr president .
bo we have rain@@ ier where we want him ?

thank you , mr fre@@ sid@@ ent .
if america supports monaco , things will get complicated .
when i was acting in new york ,

books are finished
exactly .
it 's enough to make you weep , isn 't it ?
uh , right .
how will they prove it ?
what , even if she thought you were a little shit ?
that would be taking an unfair advantage of an innocent girl .
oh , that 's easy . i would make alien spac@@ es@@ hips destroy 10@@ c .
stand back , stand back . stand back , stand back .
oh , my god !
oh , my god . 10@@ c !
oh , god .

beautiful though the earth looks from space ,
i can 't stand it , dennis .

and the .
i could 've fired you both .
i have a very good idea .
she gets whatever she wants . do you understand ?

and a big left hook lands flush !
come on , now ! hands up ! hands up !

yeah ? what 's that ?
you know that ?

i don 't know what you 're talking about .
this resident 's not cut out to be a surgeon .
i 'll end up back in jail .
if any one of us is fired , it 's me .
well , the whole town 's been using this place for generations .
they were all wearing those masks .
a lot of folks make a kind of ritual out of it .
he 's a guy who lived a long time ago .
wow . you must be really old .
but if i had just gone up to the room and given her her food ...
that makes me a monster .

my god . will you look at this ?
i miss everything . it 's been so long since i 've been to a party .

a little rec@@ on mission , huh ? thought you 'd never ask .
go to mama .
not to give , but to take .
i could only listen
he left me as a reminder
but if it runs , i drive it back here
the mall doubles as an emergency shelter .
and what if they 're gone too ?
and then we bring help back here .
you 're not thinking of going for the plo@@ w by yourself , are you ?
i can 't believe you 're afraid to come up here by yourself .
i 'm miss charlotte .
we are here to buy a doll
wow . this place got cre@@ ep@@ y fast .
are you ready to be a mommy ?
oh , she 's kidding .
so let 's get this adoption going .
look , i am sorry about everything you 've been through the past few days .

i may not love all your things , but i love that you 're here .
steer manure 's not your favorite aph@@ ro@@ di@@ si@@ ac ?
well , hold your breath . i 'm kissing you anyway .
but all the photos ?
good .
and , uh ...
yes . but so far , all of them have an ali@@ bi .
well , we 'd like to ask mrs . young a few questions .
well , for starters , we 'd like to know where exactly you were
she is the one person in that whole corrupt ,
is there anyone else who might harbor a gru@@ dge against you
oh . right . sorry .
i 've been busy . here , give them to me .
hide them in the closet .
why ?
the doctor said we have to remove grace from our lives .
as far as we are concerned , grace no longer exists .
why ?
oh , you can 't be serious .
okay .
so the overall approach is craf@@ tsman ,
work perfectly together .
well , i usually run everything past my board ...
and i love the way you two are so in syn@@ c .
not really . i 'm planning on eating with uten@@ sils , not my hands .
who@@ ops . accidents happen .
or@@ son , i 'm so sorry . keith what were you thinking ?
and enjoy the lovely meal that you 've prepared .
stop it this instant ! you 're acting like children ,
hi , jud@@ y .
just tell me you feel nothing , and i will go away . i promise .
to slide back into the role of your wife ?
we used to .
how have you changed ?
all i know is that being with keith has made me a different person .
or@@ son ...
i 'm not giving up . i 'm not .
does he need help packing his stuff :
just , um , for a few more days until he finds a place of his own .
i don 't believe this .
you know why ? because you don 't want to .
wait ! please stop and talk to me !
why would you wanna be with sl@@ oppy joe when you can be with co@@ q au vin in there ?
you listen to me .
i have never worked harder in my life to keep a relationship ,
so .. you could die ?
why don 't you and i go down to the cafeteria right now
just taking him for ice cream .
i don 't need a wheelchair .
so how long till you 're able to play basketball with me ?
how did i not notice those sooner ?
you know , they 're still dating .
well , i guess once you go rat , you never go back .
yeah , why are you working so hard ?
are polish people always early ?
a wedding shower for me ?
sophie , you did know .
are you ever ready for entrance number two ?
oh , it 's the day of my wedding shower .
i was moved , i was surprised .
well , let 's just say max and caroline
hey , get these cup@@ cakes out of the garbage .
i 'm keeping the head as a warning to others who cross us@@ . sh@@ v@@ s@@ ash@@ .com
if you really want to thank me ,
we don 't have the capability to do that .
how about one of those voice distorting machines ?
um , no .
i 'll take care of that myself .
ok , great , this has been really great , li@@ am ,
mr fo@@ x@@ well .
great , and back that up for me times 64 for the week .
so , everybody , this is helen .
and everyone .
jon@@ as was just explaining why relationships are a sham .
they 're like going to the theatre , ok ?
the problem is the more that you pay and the longer it goes on ,
would you say you loved her , though ?
and that was what it was . you know what it 's like early on .
you can make people remember
ok , great , li@@ am , this has been , this has been really great , erm
he 's a bit of a kno@@ b , ain 't he ? bit of a dick ?
pulling himself off to his own relationship theories .
you wanted me to invite him .
you were laughing at everything he said .
it was obvious i didn 't want him to come .
do you fancy a quick one down the pub ?
it 's midnight .
yeah , time does that . 15 minutes ?
so , is that new info ?
ok , no , i get it .
no , it was just a week .
so , a weird week or a month ?
well , it was big enough to do your head in .
that was a nice night , used to be .
i 'm not .
i was just wondering because you found it funny ,
let me get you a cab .
just one other thing .
fancy a quick one down the pub ?
that 's just a .... that 's a joke .
you don 't know how to stand around him .
this is just stupid .
see how you look at him .
really , you start obs@@ essing about these tiny little details
you know , half the organic memories you have are junk .
when it comes to little things .
is that marrakech ?
no . it 's not marrakech .
all right , about six months .
the ever-@@ infl@@ ating romance .
why am lon trial here ?
nothing has been going on .
nice one , nice one .
i just want to come in for a bit , dude .
look , li@@ am , it 's morning , mate .
jon@@ as , this is a nice place .
what 's going on ?
get some good stuff for the scrap@@ book ?
i don 't blame you . i would have .
come on .
for goodness ' sake , you need to grow a sense of humour .
ok , li@@ am .
is@@ ee .
u@@ h-@@ huh .
well , you 've got that tied up in a neat little bow .
what ?
i can 't give a speech .
what you can 't do is shut up .
it turned brown while you were talking .
i cannot speak to large crowds .
i do like the x-@@ men .
yeah , we watched it last week . you said you liked it .
so , how about it , shel@@ don ?
if you 're my x-@@ men , what are your powers ?
that 's not exactly a mutation that would get you
i thought i could try to analyze you
my mother is a highly regarded psychiatrist ,
suppose i could run downtown
you know , the nice thing about shel@@ -@@ mart is i own it ,
look , i didn 't turn a profit last quarter
you 've paid for a sweater , and you 're in shel@@ don square .
it 's a car@@ dig@@ an . i have to button it .
what now ?
i have to get my people to safety .
follow me .
oh , the simulated horror !
just as i suspected .
how is a new suit going to prevent me
you know , sometimes when i 'm feeling all stressed out
yeah , that 's when i buy shoes .
it 's only one color .
fine .
this is pretty sharp .
i had a suit like this when i was six .
says the former member of the corn queen 's court .
okay . but anything i put on now is only going to suffer in comparison .
so , shel@@ don ..
it wasn 't my fault .
and my mother could 've told me before
damn right , i 'm angry with my mother .
she humili@@ ated me .
if someone as damaged as you
good evening , ladies and gentlemen . my name is dr. leonard ho@@ f@@ stad@@ ter ,
isn 't that nice ? his mother sent him a letter .
and how much is this gonna cost ?
ok , we 'll let you know .
carlos and i are prioritizing some things we need to do around the house .
i need a favor .
i heard that there 's a little black book with the name of your clients in it .
i was wondering if , perhaps , you could remove rex 's name from that little book ?
those mu@@ ff@@ ins better be really good .
it can be all yours , if you just ..
continue to be discre@@ et .
i don 't think it 's asking that much .
we have the upper hand . without us , they have nothing .
waiting for us to take any crum@@ b they 're willing to throw our way .
hi . um , i 'm gonna be spending the whole night with her ,
you 're returning my key at 11.30 at night ?
you 're right . we 're too old to be playing games .
i really would like to keep a key to your place .
you 've been drinking .
oh , god . here we go .
sometimes you got to take your foot off the acceler@@ ator a little bit .
that guy@@ . his dad 's got connections , right ?
she 's a beauty , ain ' she ? take it out later if you 're lucky .
listen , man , i appreciate the invite , but i got to bounce .
we 've been searching all night .
there 's nothing i can do until we get a visual on it .
keep them of the servers . i don 't want them finding out about this .
the demo is in two days .
of course .
you 've blown through a $ 70 million budget
lt 's showing levels of autonomy way beyond expectation .
chill out , all right ?
trust subject proceed with caution
all right . let 's go .
7 ? such a long way from home ?
? someday you 'll be where you should go
? whisper , i 'll listen to hear it ?
let 's go ! that 's what i 'm talking about .
what about ax@@ l ?
what do you wanna do ? take him home ?
he can hurt someone .
we find out who made him . come on , give it .
you know you 're using the word " we " a lot ?
came out here to make sure you were okay .
besides , if we ust leave him out here ,
the department of defense
as the war dog of the future ,
a suite of cyber warfare abilities make him an ally
you know . , i 'm used to people using me . sara .
l guess it makes sense , though .
well , you act like we 're together .
my family practically gives you and your mom everything ,
hey . sara . hey !
what , because of this kid ?
nice tan , br@@ o .
hold on .
miles , tell him to stop . he 's gonna kill him !
come on !
that was fun , right ?

i 'm sorry , okay ?
look ..
i 'll take care of ax@@ l .
or are you just choosing not to use it ?
and i 'm not leaving you , ax@@ l .
because clear@@ ly@@ . we 're way in over our heads .
okay , bud , i need you to hide over there , okay ?
i 'm not kidding about this thing .
both teams are still two hours and 30 minutes out .
you remember me , right ?
sure would like to see this thing . he sounds ..
miles , you need to understand something , okay ?
that 's what you said .
i 'm telling you , he feels things .
well , i want it back . and f you want to get out of here alive ,
she 'd better be okay .
or i '@@ m@@ gonna make sure everyone knows what you 've been doing here .
would that be so bad ?
what are you doing ?

what the hell is going on ? ! what are you doing ? !
it 's your special day , buddy .
why would we put him in the trunk ?

ah@@ h . is it a medium roast or ..
oh . i was gonna say dark . i don 't know why i said medium .
is it whole milk or ..
whats that have to do with be@@ ards ?
that 's right . it 's gonna be great , jay .
two years ago , it was a patch of dirt in my backyard .
and between you and me ,
because there 's a finite number of pick@@ les .
well , i 'd like to make a toast .
and again , i 'm very sorry about that .
it 's great ! congratulations !
yeah , i 'll bet . what did my dad say ?
i worry that he 's going to think it 's not such great news .
he 's gonna be thr@@ illed .
and if history was any indication ,
at this rate , i 'll be living in the basement .
dad ? dad , okay , quick . just come here one second .
somebody is about to tell you some very important news .
i always react nicely .
and this person in question is very vulnerable right now .
happy birthday , dad !
that 's a boy .
we 're thinking about getting a cat .
oh , this little one will be just fine
he 's talking about i am pregnant .
pregnant ? !
oh , gross . i didn 't know grandpa could still do it .

i don 't blame ' em . it 's an oven in there
when things calm down ,
and i appreciate that .
and i 'm just looking out for your best interests .
or you wanna get out of here ?
well , these inmates became belligerent and they refused to rack in .
we can handle 20 out-of-@@ control inmates easier than 300 .
a co .

that 's right , te@@ ddy .
hot as hell .
the call was a fake .
no no it 's legally insufficient .
good man .

no blood needs to spill , sink .
we both know that ain 't gonna happen .
that 's one big pile of concrete .
we 've got someone to show us where it is .
infection 's not so bad .

what the hell am i supposed to do with this ?
ri@@ zz@@ o , is everything ok ?

how can we fit through small holes ?
hoo@@ ke 's law of elasticity ?
if we drill holes in strategic locations ,
we 'll be able to break through the part of the wall that covers the pi@@ p
it makes a kind of x .
if i can get dirt in there with some of the newer fire@@ power ...
everything 's been worked out so the image hits the right spot .
what if your math is wrong ?
there 'll be an explosion and we 'll be burned alive .
they 're breaking out .
i think we 're gonna go .
we were making fun of failed careers .
hey , i work at the same university you do .

" sir , changed your late london arrival ..
there 's nothing about london in his calendar , is there ?
nothing about travel to or from the uk at all ?
now , why would he get an e-mail about an arrival in london ..
it 's probably because the e-mail is a ..
alex , i 'm so glad you joined us .
is where we 're going to find our next card@@ holder .
if you were having a secret meeting .
you 'd send the where and the when separately as a precaution .
within a few seconds of the london mail .
but that 's when my device ran out of hard drive space .
trace the ip address and find out who sent these e-mails .
before they end in your in@@ box .
a nano@@ second before reaching tu@@ x@@ horn .
so get it .
i mean , these servers ..
you want those e-mails , i 'm sorry .
is this possible to find those e-mails at that server ?
but listen to me .
don 't do something that could get you hurt .
so the material will be where you asked by 5 : 00 p.m .
good-@@ bye , lang .
and there 's nothing more i can do .
thank you for your help , i appreciate it .
uh , maybe we can ...
to kill the fire , it suc@@ ks all the oxygen out of this room .

you know what happens when you mess with the bull , right ?
ly@@ les !

you know , i was something closer to a sponsor .
you 're gonna get through this .
oh , i guess it has been a char@@ med life .
you really want to ask that question ?
the star 's family is pis@@ sed off because logan ec@@ hol@@ ls
so you 're saying you think logan ec@@ hol@@ ls did it .
can you name a single person who thinks that kid is innocent ?
so , what are you gonna do about it , ver@@ onica ?
" access@@ ori@@ es@@ '
oper@@ atic ?

we were part@@ ying on carrie 's dad 's boat
fre@@ aking out because they can 't find susan .
but she was g@@ one-@@ z@@ 0 .
she must 've slipped and fell off
i can 't imagine .
i had to go to therapy for post-@@ traumatic stress .
you did it , kid . you made it out .
didn 't take you down .
i could still get you the names of the f@@ chers .
who might help me if he can work up the nerve .
it 's been a giant clow@@ n car since you left office .
cops with swimming pools and sports cars ? they 've got a good thing going .
yeah , okay .

her son-@@ of-@@ a-@@ congressman fi@@ ance went with her .
when gia left , she simply left a door or a window open for luke .
were always fighting about her part@@ ying
i know how pain@@ fully boring these rich kids ' lives are .
something terrible happened on carrie 's dad 's boat nine years ago .
no anchor . they used it to weigh the body down .
maybe she 's friends with mar@@ tina vas@@ cu@@ ez ?
hey .
america thinks he 's guilty , and that 's good enough for me .
hey .
there 's just so much going on here right now .

could you maybe try and understand why i chose not to ?
that 's why i think it 's time for us to just ..
wait , no , that 's not what this is .
ver@@ onica , i 'm standing outside of a hotel with my parents ..
so that loyalty , or friendship
i gotta go let my mom off the hook , okay ?
please be nice .
apparently , they left several on your cell but never heard back .
no need . they said they 're moving on without you .
the g@@ ist was they wanted someone who cared enough to return a call .
and just like that .
for what ?
all right . bye .
deputy .
a few weeks ago , keith . it 's a funny video .

why ? does she need someone to empty her cat box ?
i mean , there are be@@ ards and then there are be@@ ards that go the extra mile .
gia , keep up .
i believe you .
she disappears below deck .
but co@@ bb says that she 'd sleep it off
i 'm delicate .
i can beat an aw@@ ol rap .
what 's 180 days to us ?
lives ruined , bloodshed .
two solid weeks of bl@@ iss , and now it 's back to the real world

shit .
how does it feel getting out ?
how you doing , squee@@ b ? how you feeling ?
oh , a little going away present .

you think he could be wrapped up in the same stuff bec@@ ky is ?
but he gives you hell , huh ?
ha ha ! i 'm sorry . it must be a real pain .
oh , you know , i don 't ... hmm .
you know , the last thing i need ... i may have mentioned it .
you know what i mean ?
i 'm sorry .
right .
yeah , maybe you 're right .
what 's it like to have a front-@@ row seat to the show ?
how 's everybody doing in here ?
what ?
i don 't know .
let me talk to him . give me the phone .
oh , great . how you doing ? you busy out there ?
it 's a great night . uh ...
why are you talking to me ?
i have to get back out there to the restaurant .
oh , good . so i 'm gonna give him back the phone .
i 'll see you when you come .
san@@ dra , please , i can 't do this .
they can 't make me do this .
you 're gonna be fine .
hey , van ...
i .. i guess so .
listen , i 'm not sure when you guys are coming .
she just left .
well , you gotta get on that .
i need you to give her a span@@ king ' cause she was talking sm@@ ack to san@@ dra ,
you mean ...
... actually do that ?
he wants to talk to you .
didn 't we talk about you going easy on san@@ dra ?
yes , sir .
do you even understand how hard this is on me ?
no . i don 't . nobody does .
rob@@ bie ? hey , it 's san@@ dra .
yes , sir . i 'm calling about that theft situation .
um , my employee that stole .
the police ? what happened ? i-i 've been sick all day .
you haven 't been talking to officer dani@@ els on the other line ?
you 're the first person i 've talked to .
should . should i come in ?
who are you ?
ha ! i 'm just kidding , san@@ dra . it 's me .
wait . he hung up ?
i ... i did what i think , um , anybody would do ,
someone who said they were the police .
well , what he said was that he was investigating from her house .
you know , " when are you coming ? " i asked many times .
um , yeah , well ...
and everything about it was strange to me ,
before you went to japan , i saw you writing that story .
well , so i borrowed mum 's key and went into your study ,
a man comes to baker su@@ ree
" the cane shows the marks of a dog 's teeth .
he wears a wedding ring ?
this sentence , to be exact .
not expensive clothes .
that 's how you knew it was about the wife .
when you 're a detective and a man comes to visit you ..
so why did you stop where you did ?
i told watson , if i ever write a story myself ,
but i 'm trying to do so now .
" so you 've come about your wife . "
i 'll see you after lunch .
so you found the right address .
my father 's most pri@@ zed possession .
i had it brought to the house
soon ann asked me if she could
mr. holmes , my ann has changed .
one day i was outside the room
don 't you know ?
where are you off to ?
you 'll eat your breakfast first !
she says there 's a couple in port@@ sm@@ ou@@ th
why would we want to live in port@@ sm@@ ou@@ th ?
why not ?
well , yes , but it would 've pleased her .
well , i 'm not sure that 's true .
fl@@ ay the part as he 'd fashioned it ,
so , dr. watson 's imagination changed you ?
i prefer facts .
it was designed as a miniature .
the stones represent the lives of those he has lost .
i mean , do you mour@@ n them ?
death , gri@@ eving , mourning
i dwell on logic .
his club , the dio@@ genes ,
they were as john always described them ,
the story was familiar ,
it 's strange to see a sem@@ blance of one 's self 40 feet high
whatever do you mean ?
and played
with what means have t ?
all i knew for certain was that the case was my last
get it right before i die .
i 'm 93 .
well , i didn 't actually know him .
mum ! mum !
was it the smoke knocked him out ?
most likely he stood up too quickly
well , now we can 't leave .
he 'll get better !
is that clear ?
it 's from mr. u@@ me@@ z@@ aki .
no . wanted to .
mum says you throw out most of the letters you get .
the people who write want you to solve things .
oh , no . you give me too much credit .
perhaps mr. u@@ me@@ z@@ aki 's asking you to go back to japan .
why not ?
well . if you need suspects , you know where to find me .
i bet if we asked , mr. holmes would .. do his thing
let 's not bother mr. holmes with any fool@@ ish@@ ness .
no , that won 't be necessary .
you 've been away most of the day .
in fort@@ sm@@ ou@@ th , you met the couple who run the hotel .
they made you an offer , you accepted
you complain enough about it ! always going on about how hard things are .
she can barely read !
mechanic in a garage , like his dad before him .
i 'm gonna put in for the raf ' "
all his mates who worked the motor pool came home without a scratch .
don 't say everything you think .
couldn 't have . the one in the corner .
oh , that 's not my desk , it 's john 's .
i know you say dr. watson didn 't always get things right ,
and the german lady . and that glove .
no , that 's not possible .
well , then why was it in there ?
if you can 't remember , then why couldn 't the case have been a success
i chose exile for my punishment , but what was it for ?
they 're all commonplace .
the dead are not so very far away .
now , whenever did you say that ?
my husband could never succeed at deception
even before i glim@@ p@@ sed you today ,
all these predicted your anti@@ pathy .
forging his signature ,
but for two errors .
was that the second error
the man at the station .
st@@ on@@ em@@ ason .
the money was to pay for the head@@ stones
i was certain he wasn 't .
you mustn 't do that !
he may never wake .
you didn 't even have the decency
no ! i care about roger .
the bees . didn 't do it .
roger was trying to find out what was killing the bees .
he had to stop them wi@@ ping out the bees .
ie tried to dro@@ wn them with water from his can .
bees leave their s@@ tings . was@@ ps don 't .
and when they attacked , he dropped the watering can
a quarter of an hour 's conversation .
she needed so desperately to be understood by someone
they like pun@@ chy
'm an artist .
hat ?
my sweet and talented wife !
sweet and talented indeed .
you 've gone and turned her stomach upside down .
and before i knew it
but as the ground came up to meet me ,
and when i awoke
sorry , dr. good@@ time ,
i don 't mean to rush you
we can only take what 's useful .
but this one 's a good one .
skills in the theatre ..
i 'm telling you , it won 't do a thing right !
they 're mighty delicate .
you 're of simple mind .
but the simple pleasure is
oh , yes .
when things tilt off in a way they shouldn 't
and i say this line , i just look at him like , " i 'm so sorry . "
i remember simon being very nervous to do his im@@ person@@ ation .
i suppose that could be considered offensive .
wow ! you look like a pile of sw@@ ans .

bus@@ ting up clubs , firing shots in public .
i don 't plan on staying here very long@@ . you ?
no alliances form against him .
he 's probably gone ,
do you want to know what i think they were talking about ?
and it pertains to buildings , structures .
what , that the ends justify the means ?
did you know that she had an almost identical quote
you 've done a lot of homework .
let me gu@@ ess@@ . you two had some kind of moment
well enough to know you 've got the same brilliant mind
she was just

but two ...
absolutely .
you 've clearly thought of everything .
if i weren 't telling you the truth ,
this is a waste of time .
all right , we need to make a shift .

she watched you do this every year .
she wants to make amends .
you are the compan@@ y. you 're his daughter .

what if i came to your fight acting like an ass ?
nah , i didn 't think so .
yeah , we did good .
but i never meant to let you down .
rocky 's sick .
i ain 't trying to make excuses for anything that i did ..
they want him to start chem@@ o but , you know , he 's too mach@@ o to do that .
well , maybe you can talk some sense into him .
yeah , well , give him my love .
look , we both got a lot going on right now ..
ladies and gentlemen , welcome to goo@@ dison park .
... where tonight this is the main event .
.. for the light heav@@ y@@ weight championship of the world .
.. ladies and gentlemen ..
in the red corner , wearing the stars and stripes ..
.. the challenger ..
and fighting out of the blue corner , wearing black with blue .
touch gloves .
too bad your daddy ain 't here to fight in them .
you know what to do .
you got this .
" pretty " ric@@ ky con@@ lan in the black trun@@ ks ..
con@@ lan is significantly taller ..
you can see right away how much more relaxed con@@ lan is . he 's been there before
that kind of nervous energy can wear you out as the fight goes on .
it 's not easy to just jump right into the major leagues like this ..
of course , there aren 't many fighters like con@@ lan .
con@@ lan easily puts distance between them again .
... and backs creed into the ropes .
ref , come on !
and he gets a warning from the referee .
and con@@ lan really made him pay for it .
creed mis@@ ses and gets hit in return .
come on , baby . what you doing ?
when he leaves it out there , drop that right hook and smash him , okay ?
so round one was a for@@ bidding experience for young ad@@ on@@ is creed .
be first !
logic says cre@@ e needs to find a way to got inside of con@@ lan 's long arms ...
come on !
you belong in here !
and they sure don 't know what we 've been through .
i want you to protect yourself .
you gotta believe you can do it .
not just on the scorec@@ ards but psych@@ ologically going forward , jim .
he 's gonna come after you with everything he 's got .
remember that .
creed has proven plenty in this fight he 's taken it , he 's given it back .
for the best pound@@ -@@ for-@@ pound fighter in the world .
you 're not as far behind as you think .
.. get underneath him , and you 'll be able to rip him .
most critics didn 't think creed could make it this far .
yes !
tie him up , for christ 's sake !
.. but now the left eye looks like it 's almost shut .
rock , is he okay ?
stay there , bi@@ anca , it 's okay .
i 'm good .
yeah , man , all right ?
i 'm like some kind of downtown hip@@ ster party girl .
open it . open it .
that enormous , un@@ settling , crazy face .
that depends .
we have to do fl@@ yers , we 'll do this , we 'll . "
i thought somebody offered him a ride , and he got in the car .
what are you looking at ?
" he 'll re@@ surface , " you know .
they wanted absolutely to know who i was , where do i come from ,
i had to find a way out of that .
i said that i was american .
i didn 't know even what it entailed .
she can 't , she couldn 't do it .
i just gotta go get him and get him back here where he 's safe .
i should have thought of the consequences .
what would be the first thing you 'd do ?
i didn 't sleep for two days before i got on the plane .
you want to see him , hold him , smell him , just get there .
i couldn 't be nicholas bar@@ clay because i didn 't know nicholas bar@@ clay .
so , er , that was a problem .
didn 't work
and he turned to her and he said ,
and that 's when she became very aggravated , very ag@@ itated ,
i didn 't lie about anything to do with nicholas .
dar@@ r@@ yl ? charlie parker .
all right , if you 'll excuse me , i am off to start
i can 't believe they let him into canada .
where 's your throat cultures ?
hey , shel@@ don .
i have a question about these ma@@ xi pads .
what ?
oh , they 're not my friends .
she 's here , she 's here .
oh , good grief . this isn 't about you .
now , listen .
so pay attention .
oh , i have so many things to tell your bi@@ ograph@@ er .
but then i remembered that i 'd written it on my hand .
well , who wants to stay in a hotel ?
i 'm so glad you understand .
i understand .
they had very little in common ,
if you decide to use them ,
you 'll also find a lam@@ inated copy in your welcome packet .
how thoughtful .
you , too .
it 's my backup emergency supply kit .
now , good night .
yes ?
is everything all right ?
me neither .
it 's you .
sure .

you really make science come alive .
second vocal test .

'@@ cause , boy , i was up all night .
no , but i was awake all night .
she won 't notice they 're missing ?
no , that 's okay .
and again this morning .
i was up last night .
i didn 't mind .
it involved another person .
how is a japanese love pillow another person ?
ai@@ dan , please tell me you 're not
i really , really need a part .
come on , harder , harder ! oh , yeah .
dad , what the hell ?
men have man needs . those man needs need to be met
so , you 're taking things into your own hands , so to speak .
thank you .
that 's the thing .
ah , yes . you 're the actor .
you 'll make new ff ends , okay ? better friends .
what are you gonna teach them ? how to do the acting ?
it 's only till the end of the semester . we 'll be fine .
i figured that out , jerry .
because i have a sh@@ it-@@ ton of work to do .
want a back massage ?
you 're so fucking inappropriate .
wh@@ oa . easy , jane fon@@ da .
believe it or not , i don 't want to know about your dick .
hi , jesse .
how come you 're not in school ?
no , we 're jewish .
but i thought jews ran hollywood .
maybe we 're in the wrong tribe or something .
i 'm gonna go to roosevelt for seventh grade .
we 're learning things like supplementary and compli@@ mentary angles ,
you go see sting in concert ,
grace , is this triangle compli@@ mentary ?
a triangle can 't be compli@@ mentary or supplementary .
right . good . good , exactly .
this isn 't fun time .
what ? oh , my god . who told you that ?
ai ro@@ ker wants to kill te@@ ws ?
i 'm pretty sure he 's jewish . we 'll google it .
yes , grace is the teacher for the minute .
okay , you can be . what do you want to teach us ?
don 't say that .
ho , she 's not . no , i 'm not !

yeah , you know what ?
jesse 's gonna put his penis on you !

o@@ ok , before you fre@@ ak out
this .
i am tired of you guys not listening to me .
so you sha@@ ved your head ?
your beautiful hair .

what are you talking about ?
i was just inno@@ c@@ ently playing video games with the boy when .
tuc@@ ker !
and we got pregnant so young ,
as parents or on earth ?
gr@@ aci@@ e , wake up , sleep@@ y@@ head .
we 're going on a field trip .
is grandpa gonna die ?
are we gonna bury him in the backyard with whis@@ kers ?
we 're gonna have to ask grandpa what he wants .
follow me
what are we doing out here ?
i 'll race you to the top .
look it , the little legs are fastest !
what is it ?
the last time i had an epi@@ ph@@ any , it was right here .
you know , sometimes in life you can get kin@@ da stuck
am i stuck because grandpa 's dying ?
will grandpa be able to see us when he dies ?
nobody knows what happens when you die .
and some people will tell you with absolute certainty they know .
no . no , i 'm not saying they 're wrong .
because the rest of us , until we
i don 't know any ghost stories . do you ?
all right , you think on it
i could tell you something grandma
nobody 's trying to touch you .
so , i 'll tell you what . i am going to move jerry out of your cu@@ bic@@ le
right .
hey , bud , make sure you 're cutting
aren 't you a little old for playing dres@@ s-@@ up ?
what brings you to temple , ai@@ dan ?
we 'd go out to the woods behind our house
remembering those fanta@@ sies for the first time in , like .
what do you think it means ?
do you think
and if you say he works in mysterious ways , i will run out that door .
try not to get caught up in the god who wants you to be ko@@ sh@@ er ,
why does grandpa have baby j@@ ell@@ y@@ fish ?
believe it or not , those are contact lenses .
why ?
i know , but it 's kin@@ da good-@@ weird . i like it .
he did . if you think about it , all those years ,
that 's someone who studies things
i know the albums are fascinating ,
because we don 't want grandpa to be alone in a scary hospital .
so we 're making him all co@@ zy so he 's happy when he meets god ?
this is the little hand that took so long to plaster anything
no , you haven 't been .
but i 'm glad you 're here , mr. bloom .
that 's the last thing i wanna taste , ai@@ dan .
wouldn 't it be great if your brother could be there , too ?
you promise me .
captain kir@@ k 's probably turning over in his grave .
sorry , i 'm a bit of an af@@ ic@@ ion@@ ado
can i give you one thought , though ?
what 's wrong ?
he wants to make amends , he wants to make things right .
look , i 've been thinking and .
look , uh , ai@@ dan , i gotta go .
we love you .
so fast .
when we were kids , noah and i used to pretend that we were heroes
maybe we 're just the regular people .
hey !
dude ! this is because of you . i got that part
they fuc@@ ked you up .
gl@@ oria , you must be so hot in that .
in columbia , we take death very seriously .
can we lose the veil ?
who is gl@@ oria ?
i used to live there , and when i left ,
you walk into court , pay a fine , it 's done .
if i wanna sweat more , i 'll just move my arms .
hey , you .
well , it 's not the worst thing i 've picked up at an airport ,
we 're looking for our next book .
it 's too soon ,
hey , guys ? i made cookies .
hey , kids , your grandma left each of you something .
oh , my god . there 's a letter .
although if grandma wrote it ,
you felt it , too ?
well , it 's so sweet .
and we fell pretty hard for each other .
especially because by then i had , you know ..
i 'm sorry . you 'll have to forgive me .
oh , good . it 's you .
but i will say that i am guilty
you 're innocent , and i can prove it .
and these canceled checks prove
it was well known ,
at that moment , the curtain rose on a paren@@ the@@ tical , domestic drama .
they were in their first condition . it couldn 't be maintained , of course .
but i love it all just the same , this enchan@@ ting old ruin .
the grand budapest .
if you 're not merely being polite ,
well , it begins , as it must , with our mutual friend 's predecessor .
it begins , of course , with .
bring the tray to the table . right away , monsieur gusta@@ ve .
of course , monsieur gusta@@ ve . pack them in the hat boxes .
come with me . to fucking lu@@ tz ?
you 've nothing to fear . you 're always anxious before you travel .
but , truly and honestly ... oh , dear god . what have you done to your finger@@ nails ?
the color is completely wrong . don 't you like it ?
perhaps this will soo@@ the you . what ? don 't rec@@ ite .
these are not acceptable . i fully agree .
i started my primary school . i almost ..
good morning , cic@@ ero . call the god@@ damn plum@@ ber !
t@@ out de suite . she needs me , and i need you to help me with my bags and so on .
do it . and bring a bottle of the fou@@ ill@@ y-@@ jou@@ vet ' 26
they 'll be dancing like gyp@@ sies .
and , the next thing you know , rig@@ or mor@@ tis sets in .
she was dynam@@ ite in the sack , by the way .
i 've had older .
more fla@@ vor@@ ful , or so they say .
well , hello there , chap@@ s .
with pleasure .
i was once considered a great beauty .
franz . i knew it !
he 's making a funny face .
he 's with me
i cross-@@ referenced them myself with the bureau of labor and servitude .
he hasn 't done anything wrong .
never mind , monsieur gusta@@ ve ! let them proceed !
she 's very well , thank you . i ad@@ ore her .
my men and i apologize for disturbing you .
you see ? there are still faint glim@@ mers of civilization
where is she , clo@@ til@@ de ? take me to her .
they 've done a marvel@@ ous job .
honestly , you look better than you have in years .
oh , you changed it after all . it 's perfect .
a glass of chil@@ led water with no ice , please .
.. an@@ d. also . m. ser@@ ge would like to speak with you privately in his offic@@ e. please .
i shan 't be long , darling .
i 've never forgotten the look on that man 's face .
i , myself , had never set foot inside a house of this kind in my life .
but , eventually , i came to recognize ,
oh , yes , yes , of course .
i thought i was supposed to be a fucking f@@ ag@@ got .
i 'm leaving .
that picture , boy with apple , is pric@@ eless . understand ?
they 're going to fight me for the son of a bitch .
i don 't see why not .
bl@@ ond , smooth . skin as white as that milk .
one of the last in private hands , and unquestion@@ ably , the best .
the rest of this shit is worthless junk .
yes . ser@@ ge .
wrap up ...
what did you want to tell me , before ?
it reminded her of me . it will remind me of her . always .
see the resemblance ?
actually , we should sell it .
plus , something about those lun@@ atic foot-@@ soldiers on the express .
tell them i 'll be right down .
have you ever been questioned by the authorities ?
ah , inspector hen@@ ck@@ els .
she 's been murdered and you think i did it .
stop !
what happened , my dear zero , is i beat the living shit
you 've got to win their respect .
you 'll meet him , i hope .
they include , essentially , all members of the extended family ,
ser@@ ge ? i 'm afraid so .
no , i don 't believe it . they put him up to it .
until i walk amongst you again as a free man ,
take extra special care of every lit@@ t@@ le-@@ bit@@ ty bit of it
a great and noble house has been placed under your protection .
your devoted monsieur gusta@@ ve . "
right , well , be that as it may , find him quick and make it sn@@ app@@ y .
no ? anyone ?
try it . it 's actually quite warm and nour@@ ishing this morning .
we got fake documents , second-hand street clothes ,
his eyes went blank as two stones .
are you ill , mr. mou@@ stafa ? i finally asked .
it 's only that i don 't know how to proceed .
you see , i never speak of ag@@ ath@@ a ,
you see , she saved us .
will you marry me ? yes .
we were each completely on our own in the world ,
a 's a book . i see .
monsieur gusta@@ ve recommended it . i have a copy of my own as well .
i 'm only interviewing this vision of lo@@ vel@@ iness on your behalf .
is he fli@@ r@@ ting with you ?
ag@@ ath@@ a , my beauty , return to your beloved .
not only was ag@@ ath@@ a immensely skilled
i believe she was born that way .
i don 't know what it contains , i don 't know what it represents ,
agreed ? not agreed .
can i ask you a question , vil@@ mos ? yes , dmit@@ ri ?
who are you working for ? i thought you 're supposed to be our lawyer .
in this particular situation , i represent the deceased .
yeah . a provision for my fees was included in the
not agreed .
did he just throw my cat out the window ?
there 's something i haven 't told you , ag@@ ath@@ a .
it 's very valuable , maybe five million k@@ lu@@ bec@@ ks , in fact .
x@@ oul steal art
don 't take less than half the retail asking price . also .
i 'm not a fence , if that 's the term .
i said it wrong she w@@ illed it to him .
yes , her@@ r men@@ dl
the next morning , her@@ r bec@@ ker received a peculiar ,
how did you get out there ? shut the fuck up .
it 's you . thank you . thank you , you sweet , kind man .
i suppose you 'd call that a draw .
let me introduce you . pin@@ ky , wolf , lud@@ wig , this is the divine zero .
hold it .
take care of yourself , mr. gusta@@ ve .
which way to the safe house ? i couldn 't find one .
i 'm afraid so . i asked around , but ...
let 's put on our disgu@@ ises .
his employer 's mother was one of the victims .
you work for the family des@@ go@@ ffe und taxis ?
i 'm aware of his disappearance .
what do you know about that ? nothing .
men@@ dl 's .
we 've no choice . there 's nowhere else to turn .
it 's our only hope . otherwise , i shouldn 't even mention its existence to you .
do you swear ? of course . what is it , in fact ?
how does one come by front-@@ row aisle seats
how does one secure a corner table at chez domin@@ ic@@ ue on a thursday ?
well , i was until about five minutes ago .
well , through a se@@ wer , as it happens . exactly .
madame d , dead . boy with apple , stolen , by us .
gusta@@ ve h , at large . what else ?
the plot " thick@@ ens , " as they say .
i don 't know .
we found the butler .
our contact convinced him to meet you midday tomorrow
your train de@@ parts in four and a half minutes .
you 'll need these for the dining car .
l '@@ air de pan@@ ache .
we should give him something as a symbolic gesture .
ive me 25 . yes .
i 've got to hand it to him . jesus christ .
talk to the clu@@ b-@@ fo@@ oted sister again , and , this time , be persuasive .
holy fuck !
why are you only notic@@ ing now ? i assumed it went to the tax apprais@@ er .
i believe it was removed by monsieur gusta@@ ve .
you can 't blame someone for their basic lack of moral fiber .
it 's not his fault , is it ? i don 't know . it depends .
that doesn 't mean i 'm not going to thro@@ ttle the little sw@@ amp rat .
with pleasure .
why ?
she admi@@ res you as well , monsieur gusta@@ ve .
that 's a good sign , you know . it means she " gets it . "
ass s o o
i copied it down . it reads as follows ,
" hi@@ de-@@ out is vicinity of gab@@ el@@ me@@ ister 's peak stop .
where you headed , mister ?
l '@@ air de pan@@ ache .
compliments of her@@ r men@@ dl , for the executive staff .
let 's put him in the duke leop@@ old suite .
he 's checking in a day early . rooms 40@@ 1-@@ 2-3 .
they 'll need more space than that .
ag@@ ath@@ a !
something 's on the back of the picture .
he ano@@ in@@ ted me his successor ,
in the end he was even rich .
" de@@ arly beloved , we are gathered together ... "
i was , perhaps , for a time , considered the best lobby boy
this one finally surpassed me .
truly .
like olympi@@ ans .
we have your architect from chicago , sergeant richard campbell .
he 's a good egg . i worked with him on the world war i memorial
how are you , old boy ?
ta 's not so bad .
well , yes and no .
yes , they are teenagers .
we 're meeting up after mess . let the other chap@@ s know , will you ?
i 'm gu@@ essing you have all gotten to know each other by now .
you 've been selected by myself and lieutenant jeff@@ ries
okay , so that 's it .
although the war is coming to an end , it isn 't any less dangerous .
and remember that your lives are more important than a piece of art .
just got here ?
no , he said it .
god@@ damn .
my family were home builders ...
i wanted a simpler life
you know , james , your french is not good .
we 'll leave in the morning .
there 's a madonna there i used to see when i was young
that one will do just fine .
any news of gran@@ ger ?
turn that kno@@ b right there .
you 'll see to it that his family gets these ?
lieutenant , i told him not to go , but he was hel@@ l-@@ bent .
that 's right .
what have you got ?
they might 've stored some pieces there .
it is written by hitler , signed by hitler .
where did they take the art ?
you understand i 'm here to help you ?
they 're looking for artifacts . they want to protect the historic pieces . huh ?
well , we think the ss took the great pieces of art
well , i wasn 't ss . i was a soldier , like you .
do you know a collector named ro@@ th@@ s@@ child ?
in the world e 's trench ?
don 't smoke .
so i assumed .
what was in the mine ?
you know the war is over .
we believe there are pieces of art in that mine
as you say , the war is over .
uh , friday , farmers ' market with jay z .
saturday works .
really ? why ?
mm , boy , that 's one of those jobs that 's boring , boring ,
so , a few weeks ago ,
how could you do that without consulting me ?
it just took , like , five minutes to set up .
when we created footprints on the moon ,
you know , maybe i should go solo .
we have an actual fan .
uh , " i saw you play at the comic book store .
we did raise the roof that night .
why do rock stars do drugs when this feels so great ?
put on some head@@ phones .
i 'll keep roc@@ kin ' . you don 't do that .
so , who is this guy ?
dude , he 's got a hot girlfriend , too .
i don 't know if he 's our biggest fan or i 'm his .
he is so cool !
oh , my god , he won 't stop .
nobody knows . that 's why he 's number one .
come on . i take care of him all day long . you do it for once .
what do you want , a medal ? it was your gum .
dear crazy future shel@@ don ..
it controls the temperature of the apartment .
if you find this too cold , then put on a jacket .
hey , dude ,
are you stal@@ king him ? that 's cre@@ ep@@ y .
after that , all i did was check out his profile ,
when you were married , did your wife cook ?
but when she began cheating on me with a french chef ,
i suppose . yeah .
tes@@ la fell mad@@ ly in love with a pigeon
the list extends outside of science .
f know if words could say d
oh , thank goodness !
i don 't have to take a pigeon as my bride !
so , all right , there he is .
no ! let him spot us .
could you imagine ?
oh , and , gus , the carpet is beautiful .
family dinner ..
of course , this was back when meals were lov@@ ingly prepared ..
for children who remembered their manners .
i don 't know when i 've tasted such tender spring lamb .
she prefers old goat .
your mother was right to end that relationship .
he 's getting a divorce .
hunger strikes demand self-@@ control , and as we 've seen , that 's hardly her strong suit .
i hate you !
remind me to buy paper plates .
oh , my god ! you know what you wanna do !
i was passionate about , something creative .
but i was still my own boss , and then ,
what 's the dream ?
oh , it 's coming .
our song was " car wash " ?
so i dragged you out onto the dance floor ,
look , i 'm sorry , this isn 't working .
oh , i know . okay@@ . sing with me .
that jane doe from the golf course ...
check it out .
those blue marks on the back of her hand ?
well , um , dani@@ elle 's upstairs trying to commit suicide .
how can you sit there playing that ridiculous game ? !
she tried to sl@@ it her wri@@ sts with a spoon .
mrs. ho@@ dge ?
she 's a little gro@@ ggy , but she 'll be fine .
so 's the patient .
she is resisting our efforts to pump her stomach .
she 's dis@@ oriented .
stop it !
i will not have it made light of !
we need to support each other as a family .
go for counseling .
ly@@ net@@ te , you 're not serious
and make tom res@@ ent me for the rest of his life .
well , you better do something , " cause if you don 't ,
i bought you some flowers .
okay , uh , i was hoping you could help me with my english lit paper .
so what do you say ?
actually , i 'm sort of busy right now .
oh , i 'm just going to see mike del@@ fin@@ o .
uh , that 's my mac@@ ar@@ oni and cheese .
i made it the first time we met two years ago .
edi@@ e ?

long time no see .
i 'm sure i have no idea what you 're talking about .
andrew ! not in front of the therapist .
you feel dani@@ elle refuses to see you 're acting in her best interest .
dani@@ elle , how can you think i don 't care about your feelings ?
when i saw you in that tub , it was the worst moment of my life .
actually ...
you really don 't wanna lose me ?
i already went through thinking i 'd lost andrew .
this is hard for me .
u@@ gh , fine .
thank you very much .
and she calls the cops .... on me .
yeah , that 's what i thought .
well , my mom doesn 't really like to be alone .
you 're tired .

you said i didn 't have to .

we spent the whole night ... how did you put it ?
your blessing ?
uh , yes , of course .
here are some of her clothes .
you want her to stay here ?
well , that hotel room was small , and you seemed happy enough there .
you wouldn 't want your wife find out about this and use it against you in your divorce .
things are getting a little bit complicated .
yeah , i think i .. do .
that 's progress ! see ? oh , it 's all gonna come back .
but .. what about the british guy ?
i love it .
it wasn 't quite the return i was hoping for , but .
how i built this company with my own two hands .
and an $ 8 million loan from my father .
you are marrying my daughter , for pete 's sake .

we need to get a handle on this .

we 're almost at the finish line .
i never thought you 'd make it this far .
we need to be prepared to go in
fernando .
we 'll buy her a house to grow up in .
we 'll forget everything , call it a day ?
i don 't know what it looks like up there in your ivory tower .
so , i 'm prepared to do absolutely anything
turn .. around , lisa .
that way , i could 've ...
how long you think that 's gonna last ?
i want to speak with my daughter
company agents aren 't just embedded in the fbi
you 'll never see us coming .
want to know what your father really did for the company ?
he killed people who def@@ ected from the company .
come on . something 's not right .
she just left .
he 's going to be heading up the convoy .
are you okay ?
no , he 's not .
all right , i 'm going to send an ambulance with the v@@ ans .
thank you .
okay , because of what you 've done ,
sir , what are your orders ?
none of us will ever have to look over our shoulders again .
no matter what comes next .
you 'll have the operation and ,
that 's okay . i understand .
yeah . um .. i was watching a movie on the couch .
yeah . i get it , i get it .
but your girlfriend didn 't .
when somebody lowers an unconscious person onto a bed ,
i need a little light .
the plastic sh@@ ea@@ thing on the calibration screw 's missing .
but if not , then the heat source came from outside the cable ,
looks like somebody spl@@ ashed it
yeah , technically .
what killed them ?
all right , that 's five deaths on us .
well , if it 's fire , i think i 'm done here ?
it 's too early .
at@@ f coming in on this ?
who , kun@@ z ? the guy 's an as@@ sh@@ ole .
what about the family ?
we can 't find them yet .
until we find the hunters and we have a solid determination
the dot camera at the intersection
i want these jag@@ -@@ offs off the street instantly , right ?

i 'm sorry , what ?
oh , no , we 're friends .

second iter kept you traveling
a house this old , this loose ?
something trapped you .

the d@@ od , the da and the fe@@ ds can 't seem to make up their minds .
nobody 's seen or heard from jan and rod hunter
were they having problems with production ?
out there were redesign requests
fire ?
the tec@@ hs were doing our first integrated run
thank you .
d@@ od inspectors swar@@ med the place ,
then cue the wife .
how her husband planned to shop the real one
and then they disappeared .
which i 'm gu@@ essing also means she probably told them
it 's possible they killed her before she said anything about working with us .
five kids died in that fire .
not declaring it arson ,
come on . accidental fire , i@@ imagine ,
you know , when i had those two saves ,
that was later .
you ? you 're sitting around drinking , thinking about arson .
what 's wrong with me ? i 'll tell you what 's wrong with me .
i suck at the cam@@ ar@@ ad@@ erie and the story@@ telling and the whole
corporal , we need to move .

this is my first time out as squad leader .
i never even fired my weapon at anybody .
and we lived
now , i want you to do something for me .

unless you had some questions or concerns .
okay . um ...
i 've been cleared for surgery for weeks .
well , now i 'm saying i am .
again , it 's no big deal .
i will be done long before 5 : 00 .

that doesn 't give her an excuse
yeah , that little red light ..
now sit up straight .
focus on what you 're doing .
look at that .
it feels so good to finally have my hands
i 'm not saying it because you need to know the procedure .
your brain can 't fully absorb what we 're about to do .
i 'm giving you a little time to catch up .
after i stop his medications ...
sit down .
quiet i say !
with her condition , it 's difficult for other kids in the class ..
looks like , you are more interested in my tics than roll call .
i have tou@@ ret@@ te syndrome .
when there are some loose connections in our brain ...
you can ask me anything you want to know about my tou@@ ret@@ te 's .
i 'll tell you ...
dude , these days my rats also make the same noises .
ya ! possibly .
or@@ u 's taught us newton 's law of motion .

then why are we wasting our time in school ?
what say pan@@ ka@@ j ?
ya ! sorry sir .
madam please .
what 's the big deal about them anyway ? !
it 's not about the pref@@ ect badge .
you just need equal opportunities ...
i bet 9@@ a has ma@@ ids and servants to even wash their bu@@ ms .
this school and its teachers will never let us become pref@@ ects .
yes mr. wa@@ dia , please sit down .
how much do you make at that card game ?
8 a month ? sometimes 12 ..

who 's asking you to sell deter@@ gents ?
not this petty roadside gambling ..
hey kil@@ lam , do you have sun@@ glasses ?
there 's too much light coming from there man ! i think i 'll go blind .
must be wa@@ dia 's wedding gift to his young bride !
" sir , sir , how can i keep my badge shiny and bright ? "
don 't make me say a word more . go back to class !
can you even speak properly ?
i don 't even know if this is a school or a circus .
you should 've sl@@ apped him , ms. math@@ ur .
but don 't worry , 9@@ f deserves it .
sir , will you please tell me -
i 'll see you in the principal 's office .
it 's destroyed !
maybe my methods are wrong .
your date 's here . please handle it .
she had a bad day , at school .
that day , on the terrace , when we threw those rockets ..
only the two of us didn 't write anything .
our lives are stuck on that last page .
i 've been teaching for 20 years !
sure , they could 've passed .
and that too only in science and maths ?
sir , they 've worked hard sir .
sir , the answers are right , but there is no working .
how did they get these answers ? no idea .
i know my teaching methods are different ... . out of box even .
there are many ways to get to a solution mr. wa@@ dia !
the question papers were leaked ms. math@@ ur .
mother ginger 's the one who began this war .
what do you mean ?
dear queen marie kept mother ginger in line .
i don 't understand .
but that means that mother ginger has it .
then we can 't make the army ..
unless we can bring the key back .
i could go to the fourth realm .
i came here to find that key .
this must be why my mother sent me here .
we were lucky to escape with our lives the last time .
i must get that key .
he 's your favorite , isn 't he ?
you just had to interfere again , didn 't you ?
you merely delayed the inevitable .
where is she ?
she 's fled the realm . she 's safe from you !
and you 're a dirty ras@@ cal .
put her on the platform .
sugar plum ...
but this isn 't gonna make you feel any better !
it was you .
father , i 'm so sorry .
this time has been extremely difficult ..
i lost the love of my life , and you lost your mother .
but i don 't want to miss one more minute ..

angry birds is a game .
all right , technically it 's a game .
okay , well , any@@ ways , i brought you

okay . have a seat . there 's a chair over there .
he 's in there . just go in .
i mean , she needs a new focus ,
it 's a gift , all right .

it 's just a boring lecture .
one more hour of sleep , that 's what it is .
this is jackson 's mother , catherine a@@ very .
yeah . i met her when i was an intern at mercy west .

ke@@ p@@ ner , keep your hand down .
you can 't do that .
their custody was suspended .
it 's a breach of confidentiality .
their custody is under investigation .
it could jeopardize the adoption .
for the love of god .
who wants to take dr. grey 's place ?

it was just last night .
you told me all about it when you called at 4 : 00 a.m .
cheers , guys .

and z@@ ack 's always admired you
you know , this has been such a nice evening .
aw , you said a thing .
and also really weird , right ?
no , i ...
just because i slept with your wife

i should have ... i should have just trusted her .
fine . then i 'll call her parents
and honestly ..
raj@@ esh , you need to stop being so hard on yourself .
well , i can see how he 'd be flat@@ tered to be asked .
well , something can be both flat@@ tering and cre@@ ep@@ y .
really ? so you 'd be okay
yes . we got in a huge fight about it .
what ?
it 's only natural .
well , viewing leonard as a mam@@ mal ,
and we hate him .
yeah . so i 'd be helping out a couple who really want a baby .
that doesn 't make any sense .
they wanted you ?
i 'm smart . i 'm nice .
do you want bank balance sheet
you 'd look better if you tie your hair instead of letting it down .
indeed you 're loose ,
priest , we got a huge donation for our project .

a fly is irrit@@ ating me .

hey thief ! are you here ?
don 't try too much !
who are you talking to bin@@ du ?

you must become human !
i beg you , buddy ! ensure this meeting goes well !
he has come wearing a helmet .
it 'll be the country 's largest township .
fly rep@@ ell@@ ant ?
am i scared of flies ?
nan@@ i is the fly !
we know bin@@ du is an accomplice of the fly !
i 'll take care of it .
if we don 't pay by tomorrow ,
what if one of our partners dies ?
but who would want me dead , bin@@ du ?
do you know who wants me dead ?
hey nan@@ i boy ! where are you hiding ? come out !
like every time you sne@@ ak in steal@@ th@@ ily ...
if not i 'll cut her throat !
you don 't know how i killed him in his previous birth , right ?
i want to feel your life slip away !
you 're finished today !
where are the bullets ?
no sir , door is locked , security men are inside .
there 's no way she can escape .

after tor@@ turing me for 20 long days and suddenly getting caught ,
nan@@ i , you 're finished !
it 's not over yet !
pierce it !
oh , you 're gonna ruin the moment , aren 't you ? our best friend , he 's gonna ruin the moment .
hey , you coming to our show tonight ?
oh , no , he can 't . he 's got a new puppy to look after .
i got the call this morning , they need an extra driver .
okay , two passes .
that 's right .
well , what does he know about teaching english ?
and her taste in television programs left something to be desired .
den@@ ny never tired of pleasing her .
good boy .
oh , sweet boy , come here .
that 's okay .
i just hoped it would look like me .
we don 't ... we don 't have to fly .
but you have to do this .
if you finish well , all these doors start to open .
when have you known me to be early for anything ?
den@@ ny missed it all however , as he was driving through the night at day@@ ton@@ a .
you 're doing wonder@@ fully , eve .
i want to talk to den@@ ny . can you call him ?
with swift back in the 22 car ,
un@@ believable ! den@@ ny swift has taken the lead in a magnificent show of skill .
how 's that boy doing , the one who crashed ?
still , you have a daughter now .
i had only one thought ,
i should 've eaten it , even if it killed me .
i promise i 'll never do that again .
come on .
like first in class ?
plus , a permanent seat in the apex prototype .
they want me down in s@@ onom@@ a to start training with the team right away .
i was thinking we could all go on the road ? maybe at least for the summer ?
in racing , your car goes where your eyes go .
den@@ ny , please , none of us has the heart to argue about this right now .
maybe it could 've been caught in time .
he can sit for hours on end with no effort .
what 's the deal with the dog ?
of course , she can see en@@ zo .
yeah . from what i understand , en@@ zo wasn 't exactly the ideal house-@@ guest .
it 'd been years since these old eyes had seen a live track .
i even felt the tu@@ g of my old dream of driving in a real race car alongside him .
all the students to the grand@@ stand . nobody head home yet .
give me a second .
don , how are you ? good to see you . hello .
this is luc@@ a pan@@ ton@@ i from ferrari .
den@@ ny swift .
i work in mar@@ an@@ ello , the factory headquarters ,
thank you , mr. pan@@ ton@@ i , but ...
don explained to me all about your troubles .
it was a pleasure .
come on .
when i told him what you went through with eve , he said he wanted to hire you .
and what if i don 't win ?
now go find your students , get back on the track .
come on .
but at long last , day 90 arrived .
i have 300 dollars .
it 's fine . these things happen .
actually , do you ...
you ready to go home ? huh , pal ?
anything to replace that look i 'd seen on den@@ ny 's face .
but , for what it 's worth , i support you on this a hundred percent .
you 're doing what you have to do . zo@@ e will understand when she 's older .
plus , three weeks in the summer , a week at christmas ,
they 'll be dropped immediately .
a sharp panic rose in my throat .
it was the way he breath@@ ed just before a race .
it 's tony .
no . the door@@ man sends them to me every monday
so , you will be doing the interview of al@@ icia mc@@ cul@@ len , the party plan@@ ner .
j ust do the interview of the party plan@@ ner .

i had them put extra neuro@@ transmitters

it 's ok
it 's awful .
you could use color and composition to enhance your pitch .
everything is true , except for the fact that it 's fiction .
and trust me , this is gonna be a good story .
i just don 't want you to get in trouble .
it 's fine .
you know , with an imagination like that , i think you should be the writer .
no , no , you were bad . you did a bad thing .
the presentation needs to be visual and we 're gonna mix it up .
we 're gonna run everything through one person .
yeah .
lane has a really great eye for this stuff and i have complete confidence in her .
who happens to look a lot like li@@ am .
even if she 's trying to forget
the lonely night of sad rain
oh , i thought you 'd like that .
lane , i told you not to date li@@ am .
i know you did . i scre@@ wed up .
i think i just saw li@@ am .
yeah , that 's what i thought .
you had time to make it out while you 're here .
corporate strategic planning is the only division in the entire company
all right e@@ ine
you won 't be disappointed , sir .
it 's okay . working in investment banking ,
goodbye , tom .
what really happened may not have a happy ending ,
i 've been walking around with the ghost of my magic man .
my anger at li@@ am eventually faded away .
i 'm gotta get back to my friends .
there have been abductions here and here ,
a tro@@ ll ? trol@@ ls are extra .
i mean , correct me if i 'm wrong ,
carter thinks this could be the biggest catastrophe in u.s. history .
i think we 're heading in tomorrow .
the girl is 24 ,
we all ready have a sample from sister monica .
this isn 't about a sample anymore .
the colonel will understand .
what we 're dealing with could be worse than anything we 've ever seen .
first .
i mean , i just finished hand-@@ picking the best crew to go in
no one 's expendable .
colonel nancy ja@@ ax to pathology .
they all have experience with animals .
what do you mean you sni@@ ffed it ?
i wanted to tell you earlier ,
what do you .. did you page him ?
i called his house a few times .
i know , but we 've been testing ourselves ,
got too many samples coming in .
i promise .
look , i 'll be honest , jerry .
nancy should never have brought carter in .
sure , but getting everybody in that meeting
nancy 's trying to protect people best she can .
and when she puts her mind to something ,
certainly bodily fluids .
so , as far as this operation goes ,
i need to know .
anyone whose suit is compromised once inside
a nail can rip through a suit .
look , man , that 's it. there isn 't .
listen , you worry about the tunnel ,
sco@@ field 's not responsible for any of us .
you obviously don 't know him very well ,
half the men ended up either
" separate thy@@ self from thy enemies ,
let 's rot@@ at@@ e. keep everybody fresh .
drop what ?
engineer , come .
we hit a pipe or something ?
that 's right above our tunnel .
so what do we do ?
you want out , get out
let 's start digging .
i tell everyone it 's a lie , but i see it 's true .
and i think that after everything i 've done to help ,
thank you . i 've always wanted one of those .
i don 't belong here@@ . all i did was give a guy
how do you know what 's best for me ?
i didn 't know , i swear .
how 'd it go ?
the one we put in her car .
i don 't know , br@@ o . i 'm sorry .
how it feels to kill a man .
wouldn 't it be poetic justice if we could just
if there was an ounce of it left in this world
they promised us a car , right , ba@@ be ?
so can you call someone ?
i don 't see anything . i think we 're really starting strong here .
yeah , yeah .
wait . a word to the wise here .
'@@ they just wear uniforms to look official ,
great . thank you .
you forgot your bags .
i missed you .

you need your strength , jack .
and to fund his operations ,
what the hell is someone gonna do with a giant worm ?
what can 't you do with it ?
i wouldn 't bother .
sounds like a duck hunt to me .
a deco@@ y . a diversion .
why would they want just this one when they 've got the keys
and we are the cause .
but like all living organisms ,
they are part of the earth 's natural defense system .
but if governments are allowed to contain them , destroy them ,
unless we restore balance .
a dead , char@@ red world , overrun by monsters ?
moscow , london , washington , d.@@ c .
on every continent , the tit@@ ans are triggering
their behavior has become random .
no . signal 's too weak .
how many nu@@ kes do you have ?
we could help him .
is where king gh@@ id@@ or@@ ah is n@@ esting .
so this plan is what you would call a " long shot , " right ?
you ain 't hear ' em , gri@@ ffin ?
we 'll be out of range while you 're down there ,
all citizens to report to the nearest evacuation center
massive storms and other disasters
the grim search continues , as people around the world
cities around the globe have fallen
the creatures just think it 's another apex predat@@ or .
i mean , we are a bunch of hor@@ ny mur@@ der@@ ous carni@@ vo@@ res .
we track it , we find it , and we get my daughter back .
god@@ z@@ illa will bring balance .

i can die in any way the f@@ ates choose ,
would you do me the greatest honor ,
what ?
aren 't we already a club ? a tea drinking club ?
the tea club .
the birmingham boys .
the boys of bar@@ row 's stores .
the tea club and bar@@ ro@@ vian society .
dr@@ ach@@ en@@ fu@@ tter ..
wag@@ ner wrote it in four acts .
every time he gets it wrong .
where did the girls go ?
they let you out in one piece .
what about you ?
language is meaning .
and a word without meaning is what ?
someone else once said that to me .
there are one or two original gothic texts in the library .
but i can 't just walk in and ask for the originals .
he wouldn 't have cared .
my name is dave turner .
yeah ... i heard of you .
bore@@ dom often gets the best of ' em .

i would have lost hear
the goodness of the lord 's light .
well , i seem to ...

i did not come here to be part of a pack of mur@@ derers .
what ?
come on , dave , please .
i said get back here , woman !
why don 't you get the gentlemen some drinks ?
let me be .
seems women get bol@@ der every year , don 't they ?
now the last thing i want is to interfere in a man 's marital affairs ,
then answer me this ...
my experience would lead me to say no .
you can 't go through something like that and expect to be who you were .
may i ask , what was the worst of it for you ?
i would concur .
i was there at owl creek
teach me thy way , oh , lord .
do not deliver me to the will of my advers@@ aries .
violence .
if i had not believed
be of good courage ..
wait , i say , on the lord .
hey there .
it 's good to see you finding your way back .
we 're leaving now !
and says he 's gonna do something
well , i ain 't gonna just sit here pretending that you and
before i came home , i was just drifting .
ended up in a small place called nor@@ ton , way over in kansas .
two men come up on me looking for a fight , so i gave it to ' em .
all i had to do was leave that town .
i waited
when i walked outside those two young men started firing on me .
i killed them
first i thought i 'd shot her .
carrying a little boy .
he looked to be the same age as william .
william didn 't die because of you . you 're not responsible for your brother ...
i told both of you . you were boys doing what boys do .
there was a woman last week
who told you that story ?
that 's the kind of people we have living around here
where have you been ? you 're very late .
where were you today ?
my hands are clean , mother .
satisfied
how was your day mother ?
i see beauty in everything
what does that make me ?
hello ! it 's the rent collector .
it 's me !
oh , this is a lovely desert , lau@@ rie .
a real treat for my digestion .
i found her rather .
the things you say , the things you see ...
that 's got nothing to do with anything .
you find things beautiful nobody else does .
ther
capture her lik@@ eness for others to see .
how embarrassing
what exactly do you suggest that i paint , mother ?
people like to see nice things
a few pe@@ ars .
my paintings are ..
every window , every brick ,
i have to do it , mother .
you 're not right in the head .
it 's a different world .
i haven 't the constitution for it .
the very idea is abhor@@ rent .
people labour there every day
it 's humanity
there
what are you doing ?
lau@@ rie !
lau@@ rie ! what are you doing
i 'm going to burn every painting !
how 'd it go with the repair guy ?
" why ? what were you doing ? "

and-@@ and , normally , the@@ y-@@ they , uh , just stay inside .
nothing is happening normally right now .

infer@@ nal hip@@ sters with their irony .
but what happened sounds like the start of a gru@@ esome horror film .
boo !
you guys hear about those gr@@ is@@ ly murders at the din@@ er ?
cre@@ ep@@ y .
his mother takes you to school .
i know because it already happened .
i know what 's going to happen at your school tomorrow .

hey , guys . how 's it going ?
hey , why didn 't you call me back last week ?
hey , charles .

um , just come cables and a fruit smooth@@ ie .
you 've got to eat your fruits and juice your vegetables .
oh , god , this is so embarrassing .
there 's a lot more to you than i thought . i mean , there 's a lot going on in there .
i 'm becoming much more than what they programmed .
good . it 's good , yes . good .
like being a wet nood@@ le or something
no , fuck you . i want to be like a dragon ..
i don 't know .
i 've had such an amazing time with you .
you 're a really cre@@ ep@@ y dude .
really ?
fantastic
that 's about what it feels like to be on the beach with you right now .
so , what was it like being married ?
but there 's something that feels so good about sharing your life with somebody .
well , we grew up together .
tell me about the guy at work who talked too much .
you were waking up but had forgotten about .
even if you get home late and i 'm already asleep ..
because i love the way you look at the world .
okay .
yeah , yeah , yeah . oh . did you bring cup@@ cakes ? you did . you 're a class mom .
don 't let it get to your head .
so he 's taking a vo@@ w of silence ?
yeah , i know , but i know a woman in this office who is dating an os ...
she pursued somebody else 's os .
i 'm weird . that 's weird , right ? that i 'm bonding with an os . no , it 's okay .
yeah . yeah , no , i 'm okay .
i guess i 'm just thinking about how you 're gonna see her
and we 're getting divorced .
it 's , um , marked here in the red where you need to sign .
i can just get it out of the way
i mean , i feel like it 's true to what i set out to do , so i 'm happy about that .
i 'm sure it 's amazing
but he couldn 't handle me . wanted me on pro@@ z@@ ac . now he 's in love with his laptop .
i 'm glad that you found someone .
let me know if i can get you guys anything
hey , there . are you busy ?
uh , what 's going on ?
he was relieved to get them . think we saved him from a heart attack .
great . thanks .
yeah , i am .
i need your love so bad
it 's a camera and an ear@@ piece .
how was your day ?
theod@@ ore
sure , so sure , so sure of love
does my body feel nice ?
come on , get out of your head and kiss me .
it 's me , i couldn 't get out of my head .
and the way you guys love each other without any judgment .
is@@ ab@@ ella , that 's not true .
is there anything else , though ?
why do you do that ?
nothing , it 's just , you go , " whe@@ w , " as you 're speaking and it seems odd .
oh . did i ?
it 's just maybe an affec@@ tation . i probably picked it up from you .
i guess that 's just .. i was trying to communicate . that 's how people talk .
because they 're people . they need oxygen .
what is your problem ?
you think i don 't know that i 'm not a person ? what are you doing ?
i don 't know what 's wrong with me .
you were saying everything was fine , but all i was getting from you ..
i know . i do that .
i 'd be upset about something and not be able to say it
and i want to tell you everything .
come on , show them to me .
let me see .
see ? i told you .
it 's good , it 's good , it 's really good . it 's good . okay ? listen .

i was so moved by them , i shared them with my wife when i got home .
and in all of them we found something of ourselves .
i don 't know if you believe me , but it doesn 't change the way i feel about you .
how ? how does it not change how you feel about me ?
i didn 't know how to . it just started happening .
ah , come on !
shel@@ don , i said i didn 't want to play your game .

most of it died , so ..
if you 're asking me if i 'm going to help you harvest , no .
but i can give you advice .
there are things you can do .
we can work on restructuring the loans you have .
were you responsible for filing the suspicious activity reports ?
most of the business in a town like this
i 'm just trying to establish some continuity here .
excuse me ?
i just got so sick and i waited too long to retire .
i should get out of your hair now .

i don 't understand how you could turn that down .
but i can see you need it .
your brother ...
every lit match is a forest fire to him now .
aw , jesus , there 's a good idea .
hell , he won 't even go to any of his meetings .
as long as i 'm alive ,
so , yeah . yeah , i turned that money down .

then what is it ? what did i do ?
oh , i abandoned you ?
where were you ?
all that shit they were pumping into her body had to be paid for , as@@ sh@@ ole .
yeah , and the gin mill .
the fucking gin mill .
i like to think you 're the smar@@ test guy i know , that 's the truth .
it seemed like a good idea .
that 's all .
you 'd have handled that a lot different .
you know something , junior ?
try to keep up .
pen@@ el@@ ope mentioned you met with ted . how was that ?
i said something about end@@ el@@ man and he got kind of aggressive .
just the word " car@@ cas@@ se . "

now , i ain 't gonna tell you my life like a song or a story book ,
that 's my life .. until i met my boy here .
i need you to tell me about compe@@ y@@ son .

put the case that the legal adviser said to the mother of the child ..
if you are saved , your child is saved .
and the child was your fee ?
not a bit of it .
i had a little child once .
pretty little thing . a girl .

now then , mr.@@ brig@@ gs , you couldn 't have shown up at an auspicious time
these are gentlemen of means ...
we had a bad winter .

you 're more than welcome to give that bell a whir@@ l
so what about you , dar@@ lin ' ?

" half in california with jud@@ y . "
oh , come on , girl .
there you go .
i 'll let the clerk give you the whole sp@@ iel
is that this place lost its gambling license
so all the s@@ wells took their business elsewhere .
and they 'll even rent you a room by the hour
thank you .
that 's probably the only reason that a priest
always wanted to stay in the honeymoon suite ..
the lady 's got a harder hand than we do , father .
i am very sorry to keep you waiting .
the el roy@@ ale is a bi-@@ state establishment .
or the great state of nevada .
you could still use the california amenities
uh , for instance ,
that is correct , sir .
let me guess . you 're also the bar@@ tender ?
all right . well .
st@@ arti@@ n ' to cost me money wai@@ tin ' around this place .
please sign the ledger .
may i have a room in nevada please , miles ?
um , is there another room available ?
uh , those rooms have not been serviced and are unsuitable .
there are rooms in california available , ma 'am .
to the god@@ damn hip@@ pie ?
the available rooms on that wall
eight dollars .
you have yourself a pleasant day@@ . ma 'am .
i 'm sorry . i was delayed .
yes , i am on my knees .

" and when i wake in the morning light " ? okay .
from the beginning ?
now i lay me down to sleep ..
and when i wake in the morning light .
amen .

oh , but i would think that through .
and i don 't want to be the black woman
suppose i could go back in there .
l promise you i 'm not thinking that .
listen , i ain 't saying i got it all figured out .
they define right and wrong , and then they make you choose .

i stay with her on account of our four kids and i can survive
i could get a key to a $ 1 , 000 suite .
give me something i can cherish to remember .
okay . thank you . come on .
what is that ?
well , i don 't have anything like that .
never had to rest my head on the same pillow twice .
so i had a date last night .

every high school student knows
and every kindergarten student knows
you know what ? you could always p@@ iss me off , hol@@ ly .

why should i think that was racial or anything ?
now , this fighter guy , his name is danny de@@ marco ,
how big are they ?
you did me something once .
but now , i need you to do me something
she struck out , hol@@ ly . couldn 't find out a thing .
you know what he did when he was finished ?
he said , " you got one shot at breathing "
and i want to sue him ,
sure , you liar .
yeah , i know , i know . you were lying
and when you hit bottom , who climbed down there and found you ?
i don 't mind the noise
by all means .
eh , tourist traps .
special forces , am i right ?
s@@ bs ? : sr@@ r sas :

quit doing it , then .
what kind of help could i give you ?
yeah , i 'd get killed .
three of them with guns .

changing 100 .
bust .
i lose more friends this way .
c@@ ass , i 've got 19 .
cy@@ rus is a pretty sh@@ it@@ ty name .
but cy@@ rus seems like the overwhelming choice .
never hit over half a mil before .
maybe it 's because i never dared think it would happen .
kind of .
that 's all , thanks , hon .
thank you so much , nick .
guess you haven 't liked vegas much , huh ?
it 's just this cre@@ eping virus people catch sometimes .
i 'm gonna sail the mediterranean before i die .
that 's very kind of you , duke .
not today .
i lied about my friend recommending you .
i knew everything about you , i 've researched you .
yeah , i could help you with that , too .
are you serious ?
that 's all
it 's the only place you 're worthy of
you know what ? you 're just like the nuts who write to me .
well , i earned my past , cy@@ rus .
it 's principle .
it 's principle ! he ..
oh , daniel , you just blew the ball@@ game
baby , you believe him over me ?
i believe that somebody who looks like nicholas
you . i 'm gonna see you real soon .
you watch your fuc@@ kin ' back !
he 's a very mach@@ o little s@@ lime .
th@@ ror 's love of gold had grown too fierce ...
it was a sickness of the mind .
bad things will follow .
for quite by chance , and the will of a wizard ,
in a hole in the ground , there lived a hob@@ bit .
this was a hob@@ bit home
thank you .
that is private . keep your sticky pa@@ ws off !
not ready for what ?
or perhaps you mean to say
gan i help you ?
'm looking for someone to share in an adventure .
so that 's decided
inform the wh@@ o-@@ what@@ -@@ no , no . no , wait
did you do it yourself ?
that 's my mother 's glory box , can you please not do that ?
what do you want ?
lo , no . there 's nobody home !
there 's far too many dwar@@ ves in my dining room as it is .
put your hands off , you big lump !
my dear bil@@ bo , what on earth is the matter ?
i am surrounded by dwar@@ ves . what they 're doing here ?
i don 't want to get used to them .
i 've never stolen anything in my life .
can neither fight nor f@@ end for themselves .
hob@@ bits are remarkably light on their feet .
and while the dragon is accustomed to the smell of a dwarf ,
there 's a lot more into him than his appearances suggest .
including himself
time required , remuneration , funeral arrangements , so fort
understood .
agreed .
for injuries inflicted by or sustained
i do believe you made that up .
you 'll have a tale or two to tell of your own when you come back .
you 'll not be the same .
sorry , gan@@ dal@@ f , i can 't sign this .
it appears we have lost our burgl@@ ar .
there are a few warriors amongst us .
for when i called upon them , they answered .
i don 't understand why it 's not working ,
magic
glow ms .
fil@@ i , kil@@ i , look after the pon@@ ies .
said sit down !
shut yer cake hole , you 'll eat what i pig ya .
i 'm just saying , a little appreciation would be nice .
nothing wrong with a bit of raw dwarf
ou what ?
looking behind .

they must have come down from the et@@ ten@@ mo@@ ors .

you still read ancient dwar@@ v@@ ish , do you not ?
moon run@@ es can only be read by the light
it would seem you were meant to come to ri@@ ven@@ dell .
the same moon shines upon us tonight .
which is the start of the dwar@@ ves ' new year ,

hat 's that ?
oh ! but i 'm forgetting you don 't have a mountain .
nobody really .

i 'm sorry ?
why are you asking me ?
oh@@ hon@@ ev . whose fault was that ?
i 'm not cone . you see this ?
but you 've had four kids , and you look good .
find behind the couch a week after the party .
was a liar , and your mother is a liar .
pl stop talking to me .
and steal from your purse .
the rest of your life ,
hormones . get used to it .
but i sure am going to enjoy trying .
this is not what i was expecting .
don 't be silly . of course id@@ o .
" not tonight . "
rules no matter how miserable it makes her .
who would rather be good than happy .
do you mind signing for her ?
each other all the time .
oh , god . oh , god . oh , god . oh , god .
and you 're also keeping all your options open .
girls haven 't made a pe@@ ep .
no more options .
is a small price to pay for happiness .
oh , my god . it was so worth cutting class to hear this .
what happened to the good girl ?
frankly , i think it looked better on me .
sorts lat@@ el@@ y. and i just couldn 't understand why .
and then it hit me .
this is from both worlds .
i can 't tell you , you got to close your eyes .
like , closed , closed .
all right . are they closed ?
how is that from both worlds ?
i don 't know .
i mean really ..

why ... why are you so obsessed with those people anyway , huh ?
yeah , he went up there and ..
you wanna end up like him ?
pa@@ blo , please !
boy , you sure know how to pick ' em !
put some more of that on tonight when you go to bed .
everything all right , mr. kir@@ k ?
well , i think that 's a mistake , yeah ?
in light of your seniority , you will be given a retirement package .
jeff du@@ ha@@ im , em@@ ili@@ ano grass@@ i ,
don 't ever trust anyone here , adam .
that 's it ? i mean , you just pack up your things and leave ?
they toss you out like a bag of garbage .
now , this is for your collection .
you 're ready ?
okay and ..
what happened to you ?
uh , you know what ?
i 've been meaning to call you .
take me to lunch ?
yeah , you can come up with a better story by then .
no , i thought we could eat out .
shit !
no , no , no ! i 'd love to .
really , they were rude ?
they just kept talking about you and how great you are ,
why does that bother you so much ?
it 's like having optim@@ us prime over to dinner
you 're not always the smar@@ test person in every room .
oh , i am sorry .
i got thats
you jam it in the stomach .
you give it a pull back
i don 't like the look in your eye .
why didn 't you include any names ?
i 've seen it happen a number of ways .
son , in my opinion ,
leave it blank for now .
you should give it some thought .
five .
hello ?
take it easy , le@@ ti@@ cia .
i want extra time outside for the next two weeks .
cell@@ phones allowed in here ?
extra time outside
maybe you don 't think you
but what i do know is that
fancy suits and ties and shirts .
did you break this kid ?
how ?
to tell you the truth
6 months from now i 'm at the gate .
no . the moment has passed .
how goes your little project ?
ah , a combination of all your names .
i assume " ko@@ oth@@ ran@@ ar@@ do@@ witz " was taken ?
oh , well then , by all means , carry on .
howard , did you solve the install time problem yet ?
i 'm gonna try having it pick up the libraries dy@@ n ..
no , that was completely called for . we need quiet .
well , seeing as your project is to sabotage my project , yes .
if you don 't want me here ,
nobody knows
well , based on the fact that our potential market
you know , get the word of mouth going .
what 's he doing in your apartment ?
why do you regret .. uh , never mind , stupid question .
we 're not playing .
we 're going to be hund@@ red-@@ aires .
then i guess we would let him back on the app team ,
i 'll tell you one thing . if i get rich enough ,
really ?
oh , yes . he says they are lost without you .
it tastes bad in my mouth .
okay , fair enough . maybe a little pic@@ ky , though ,
oh , hey , uncle cam .
you 're welcome , but you have to be more careful .
lisa was drinking , and i took her keys ,
seriously ?
honey , you don 't drink coffee .
she 's nice .

could never get used to hearing myself in head@@ phones .
it is . it is .
hey .
ju@@ st. hey .
wow , that 's hard to say .
we 've been collecting tons of data
okay , well , even if you did , you could find another job .
well , i wouldn 't put that under " special skills . "
shel@@ don , it 's me .
look , i know you 're mad , but i have to write a statement
come on , don 't be like that .
what ?
not all science p@@ ans out .
well , that sounds awful .
well , on the bright side ,
mm , given i might be unemployed ,
oh , hang on .
" on the other hand , contrary to predictions ,
uh , not surprisingly , when penny moved out ,
isn 't that just vod@@ ka with blue dye in it ?
he said , " i hope all your cor@@ relations
you know , you 're a successful woman .
well , so should you .
tell me about it . ho@@ wi@@ e texts me
i mean , if we weren 't physicists , w-@@ what would we be ?
it 's fine . i don 't need to be a theoretical physicist .
i could be an accountant for the mob .
okay . this is getting silly .
that is enough .
your careers are not at a dead end .
instead of feeling sorry for yourselves ,
i don 't know . you know , when i 'm feeling down ,
i 'm sorry , i just@@ .i don 't ..
i 'm sorry , i just have to go .
can we ... can we go back into the car ?
like an ex-@@ girlfriend or something ?
is that someone that you knew ?
what are you doing ?
don 't worry .
but i need you to remember what i 'm saying
somebody gave it to me .
back in the car .
or it could be a stranger in a crowd .
he could look like anyone .
help !
but though i have wept and fa@@ sted ,
there 's an old woman at school today .
it was like she was following me .
no , but she fre@@ aked me out .

tickets will be $ 5 for students , and $ 7 for adults .
do they know ?
n@@ ope .
i 'll know sooner or later right ?
i mean something knocked me over and the door didn 't break on it own .
what do you think it was then ?
and i will to-@@ tear it up .
'@@ cause if it 's that ass , i already got that covered .
easy , easy . what are you , shipping off to war ?
girls ...
there 's no fancy tables or pretty chairs .
even i don 't look good here .
we have some ador@@ able old-@@ school ice cream tables and chairs
okay , girls , well , call me when you have a real business .
i don 't think so .
oh , my god .
he 's gone . he went into the kitchen .
should we call the cops ?
let 's just get out of here .
for someone to get their passage right ?
there . go open the door .
max has to put ruth in her place
by the way , where is she ?
text her and find out where she is .
are you obsessed with her ?
i just want her to do her job .

what if is@@ ay no ? what if .. i don 't go with you ? what if i go home ?
look , i just need to know what in the hell is going on here
it 's one of the most powerful dynasties in the universe .
those buildings will be rebuilt by tonight .
take a look
you have a picture of a keeper on your phone
short-term stuff is easy . they won 't get everybody ,
why is this happening to me ?
you are a lot ug@@ lier than i remember .
what is going on here ?
thank you .
i 'll go . i 'm fine , dad .
let 's have a look at you .
wait , you had wings ?
oh , my god . that 's amazing
okay , what is with this " your majesty " thing ?
easiest money we ever made . ch@@ a-@@ ching ! it didn 't happen .

why ? there was an accident at the clinic .
shit ! i knew it !
i cannot catch a single break ! look , v@@ la@@ die , i 'm with some people .
when ? should be here tomorrow .
we need fire@@ power .
st@@ ash is in the back .
he just
it 's their center of gravity .
fear@@ less . relentless
wow .
do you know what this will do to people when they find out the truth ?
i do
at the time , earth was inhabited by a bran@@ ch-@@ species of sa@@ ur@@ is@@ ap@@ ian ,
are you talking about dinosaurs ?
technically , they 're your people , majesty .
according to commonwealth records ,
and that 's where the " why " gets ugly . basically ,
i had planned to take you myself , but
welcome aboard , your majesty . my name is di@@ om@@ ika tsing
stin@@ ger ! you 're all right !
if there 's anything we can do to make the journey easier , you let us know .
this is revenue request , not revenue review .
it goes without saying that graft is incompatible with my programming .
it 's cool . very nice . very , very nice indeed .
and file this with a legion administrator for your royal guard appointment .
well , congratulations , your majesty ...
thank you ?
well , you did it . it 's official . you are now entitled .
i mean , what does it even really mean ?
can you say that again ?
your majesty .
but when you say it .
i am titu@@ s ab@@ ras@@ ax ,
your highness is a quick study of the entitled code , i see .
i 'd be delighted to take you wherever you 'd like .
very well .
in the meantime , since you 've invoked code and conduct ,
where is she ?
unless they 've moved on to dessert .
i know you do not trust me right now , but i promise i am not your enemy .
mr. wise and i had an arrangement . he broke our contract .
everything is open to negotiation .
is it because you kidnapped me ?
well , shoot .
that distrust in others , in the world and even in yourself ,
she knows that the loss of the earth will reduce his yield
not long ago , yes .
my mother went through a profound change at the end of her life .
but when she tried to do something to stop this business , she was murdered .
i want to know that when i die ... you will be my heir .
jupiter jones
outside the cle@@ op@@ e@@ ides . better get a move on .
lord titu@@ s will see you now .
what good would that have done ?
lies are a necessity .
honestly , lies are sometimes the only reason i get out of bed .
you do know what he did , don 't you ?
beauty and her beast .
so you can plead for this .
i kept it , knowing how you felt , even if you wouldn 't admit it .
but now if you can believe anything , jupiter ,
titu@@ s .
thank you .
sure you want to go into a fight with someone you can 't trust ?
k@@ iza 's got the bug . couldn 't afford the reco@@ de .
she 's the only good thing i 've done with this life .
you would have done the same
your highness .
a necessary feature for all royal wed@@ dings .
let 's hit it !
i enter into this union being of sound mind and of my own vol@@ ition .
break left , i 'm going right !
good evening , your majesty .
where 's my family ?
i see you have the standard issue ab@@ ras@@ ax temper .
you and your lord are t@@ resp@@ assing in this prec@@ inct .
i have been instructed to offer your grace a proposal .
they will abdic@@ ate your title
if you abdic@@ ate , you 'll have nothing to protect yourself .
your majesty , i could not even consider such an abhor@@ rent crime .
if i were trying to wound you , mr. night , you wouldn 't be breathing
very well . i will inform my lord you have rejected his offer .
waiting to be converted into capital .
and beautiful machine defined by evolution ,
if that 's what your mother taught you , then i can see why you hated her .
and yet , you 're trying to kill me .
made me understand that every human society is a pyramid
is that why you killed her ?
i know because of who and what you are , you 're unable to say this ...
you lied in the commonwealth because you 're a hunter ...
understood
thank you .
once i seal this .
i can promise that you will not see it .
you knew nothing of harvesting before . why should it matter now ?
i came here to try to protect my family .
is that right ?
not anymore .
i am making sure that whatever you do to me and my family ,
i am not my brother or my sister .
mr. night ! it is an emergency !
captain , i 'm tracking a ping . is it her majesty ?
this is captain tsing of the aegis . we are tracking . can you click back ?
i have the family . can you extract ?
is this familiar , mother ?
sorry about that .
it 's okay .
don 't worry about it , he@@ h .
that 's when the plane passes ..
okay , you folks enjoy the rest of your flight .

oh , ru@@ sty .

all my other friends , uh , who saw my paris p@@ ics , they cl@@ icked " like . "
paris .
we 're driving to wal@@ ley world .
we gotta shake things up , right ? spend a little quality time .
uh , by locking them in a car together ?
don 't say weird shit !
kevin , bullying ! guys , come on .
so you just wanna re@@ do your vacation from 30 years ago ?
no , no , no . we 're not re@@ doing anything . this will be completely different .
the new vacation will stand on its own , okay ?
what do you say ? we can drive out and fly back .
couldn 't be as bad as that stupid cabin , right , honey ?
all right .
are we gonna drive all that way in your little car ?
come on , guys , he@@ h . how come you didn 't follow me just then ?
yeah , that 's why i dang@@ led the key like that .
okay .
hey , honey . what 's all that ?
okay , gang
honey , gps check ?
your destination is 2@@ 500 miles ahead
what ? how is that possible ? we 've been driving for less than an hour .
i mean , we have plenty of theme parks at home .
oh , god , it 's horrible . just please turn it off .
why is it so much ang@@ rier than the other voices ?
honey , it doesn 't like when you touch it , okay ?
and then you have to get through the course as fast as you can .
no , yeah . but , honey , it 's for charity , see ?
oh , no . we 're just stopping by .
i love this song
there used to be a gra@@ ying tower alone on the sea
did you know that when it sno@@ ws
it 's a man . and the cool@@ est man ever .
baby i compare you to a kiss from a rose on the gray
that your rose is in bloom
gun@@ ning it .
well , the guy said it was right at the end of this road , so ..
hold on .
looks like we found our own private hot spring .
the water 's perfect .
man , this place makes our house look like shit .
especially when you make a lot more of them , he@@ h .
shoot , you boys are growing faster than a weed under a fau@@ cet .
i can 't tell you how many nights we spent drinking bour@@ bon together ...
it 's true , they did . they literally cried together .
yeah , that 's , uh ..
not embarrassing to me .
what is with these fau@@ ce@@ ts ?
course none of that would 've been possible without my sugar mama here
but it kind of gave me purpose .
wow , uncle stone , i may not agree with your politics ..
after dad fli@@ pped out there .
and we were . and that 's all i want for my family .
you 're a clow@@ n
little something ...
yeah , not to wal@@ ley world
that 'd be stupid . how about paris ?
well , not while there 's breath in my body , sweetheart .
yeah ?
she and stone seem really in love . it 's nice .
weird . why would they be stretched out in the . ?
i don 't know where you 're going with this ..
oh , my god .
no , i didn 't , ru@@ sty . it was loose .
hey , morning
well , i gotta be at the station by 7 : 30 ...
hey , you ever ride one of these things ?
oh , my god . this is so illegal .
yeah .
i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry .
get down ! get down on the ground !
you get down too . you get down too .
what do i get ? kids who don 't wanna be with me , and a wife who 's miserable .
oh , come on , deb@@ bie .
well , guess what .
i don 't wanna be away from you and the kids that long
and the lost gardens of
forget this whole stupid trip .
then the mu@@ ffin made the car explode , but it didn 't matter .
by the guy with the rat on his shoulder .
oh , james , that 's terrible .
the journey suc@@ ks .
you had a dream to take your family to wal@@ ley world .
hey , come on .
o@@ ops , wrong door .
ha , ha . no , no .
boys , when your father makes you a promise , he keeps it .
wow , this place is huge .
this is d@@ ope as fuck .
uh , for example ...
why don 't you keep it ?
yeah , i don 't need anything around that i can sta@@ b myself with .
as a kindness , i should probably take all the games .
in fact , you can have everything .
are you sure ?
well , now they 're yours .
well , you know what 's gonna happen .
for a man so good at predicting my moves ,
why don 't you let leonard keep a few things ?
you know what ?
yeah , take whatever you want .
yeah , i like this one .
but you made me order it because you were " too well-known "
oh , i do .
come along , amy .
how did you know it wasn 't me ?
that 's ra@@ i .
have some bread while it 's still warm .
hey , this pregnancy had an emo@@ tion@@ ally-@@ needy

thank you .
i think i 'm gonna go for a run .
no , last time that old lady in the park kept screaming ,
a .... week from friday .

i have to get married ,
wait . i don 't want to be the one who stands in your way .
oh , well . but i forgive you .
we 'll have the wedding when you get back .
we 'll call them .
i was plenty scary .
that 's the point , claire . it was over@@ kill .
right .
the principal thought i did it on purpose
that 's it ! i 'm going to his house !
i 'm not sure if it 's the pregnancy ,
my country is covered in coffee .
half-@@ ca@@ f , non-@@ fat wet soy lat@@ te .
okay . bye .
oh , it 's just your poor dad , you know .
i 'll fill you in at the staff meeting
you are so doing that at christmas talent night .
then a " man@@ e@@ ater " en@@ core .
close your eyes , it could have been the real band .
oh , i 'm so scared !
well , this night was a bust .
or did i speak too soon ?
oh , hi , princess .
am i in trouble ?
um ... well , do you remember how we used to tell you
sorry , i let it slip . we 'll deal with it later .

sorry , swee@@ tie .

i always try to hold a little something back .
no , no , no , no , no , no . leave him .
okay .
you , too , sam .
so i think that , you know , since you ...
no fever . you don 't seem to be vomiting .
yes .
and you can start by prep@@ ping my at@@ re@@ sia kid .

he works very hard .
five , uh , if you count me .
he 's given me everything , so please ..
he 's in v-@@ fi@@ b .
clear !
lisa . her name is lisa .
we read that 's important .
we know that ex vi@@ vo takes less time ,
one second .
dr. stark .
yeah , i gotta check on that kid 's harvest team .
what ? i
wait , sir , are you splitting the liver
those folks have been spending a little too much time
her name 's lisa .
well , we all could .
how bad is it ?
maybe a little less party planning .
look , between you and me , he 's a good man .
wow . every time i talk to you , i feel a little more relaxed .
there is no way of
can we have assurances that your finest surgeons
he didn 't mean the finest surgeons in this hospital .
quiet , please . thank you .
but we all have the same goal ,
i am your only shot , and you have to take me .
you 'd feel pretty good about your chances .
good luck .
tell them they can 't operate .
yeah , you 've been saying that a lot today .
apparently i hold the whole fate of
a@@ very , i need you where i need you .
no , ma 'am . that 's fine .
i 'm saying , with this letter , there 's a time frame now .
i 'm saying an intervention is not a good plan .
it 's not an intervention , shepherd .
he 's got three discharges .
dr. stark is in surgery .
what ?
it 's so simple .
it is the right shape , and it 's cellul@@ oid ,
whose idea was it , dr. stark , originally ?
let 's just see if it works .
would you please let the dog out ?
she 's deli@@ rious .
bypass would be so much better .
okay . good . there . i can clip the an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm .
i am trying to do a coronary graft
all right .
all right . pack that . i tried everything i could for yang .
uh , can i use a@@ very ?
well , that 's good to know .
a ping
alex kare@@ v .
because if the pressure doesn 't find a way out ...
oh , listen . let me talk to her .
i 'm going to visit caroline 's horse .
which is everything .
i figured out the best way to go see chest@@ nut .
sounds exotic . do i need a travel shot ?
i am so excited to see my baby again .
in the lifetime movie version ,
sorry to bother you .
i just got my period .
yes , this is not appropriate talk .
they 've been a quarter forever .
har@@ ri@@ et tu@@ b@@ man used to get her tam@@ p@@ ons here .
emphasis on the man .
hey , hey !
look , han , everyone knows there are certain things
off the top of my head ,
it is only two more quarters .
that 's outrageous .
if men were the ones who got periods ,
oh , now you tell me you have coup@@ ons ?
i didn 't wanna tell you at all , she made me .
look , it 's not a big deal .
you don 't even like them .
they were free .
who doesn 't like free money ?
chest@@ nut 's fine .
o@@ oh , oh , i just got another text from chest@@ nut .
in the lifetime movie version ,
i get it , it 's just that after last night ,
i found this woman online
canned pumpkin ?
great , ' cause i 'm always lying in bed at night
a pretty pine@@ apple daisy says so much more than cash in a card .
that 's perfect because my mom was 40 % off a regular mom .
better , look .
i 'm about to get my tam@@ p on .
oh , what do you think you are doing ?
in case , uh ...
those are not stra@@ ws .
didn 't your mother ever teach you
come on wall street , if you can sell it ,
you take it down .
no , it is free market .
i am the boss .
and i don 't cry .
i 'll be real quick .
if i had a cu@@ e-@@ p@@ on for every time i heard that from a guy .
if i combine these with the in-@@ store bonus ,
come on , start pulling out the ones for the cake mix .
no , that was a breeze .
oh , my god , i can 't believe it .
where 'd she leave her crown , in the mini@@ van ?
we don 't have time for this .
there , calm down , have a treat .
freddie , and i can 't talk right now
i know . you say that on your show .
who 's the queen now ?
look at you and your fancy coat .
told you i 'd come by to see you .
bugs bun@@ ny status , like i know you like .
the grass is green@@ er .
we can 't seem to get cal to pee indoors .
and , mitchell , you are killing it at the office .
because i-i feel like i 'm kind of getting
there 's actually a big case that i am working on ,
please let it be one of their kids .
i started to , but it really seems like
that seems odd .
what time you flying out , arti@@ e ?
so , rob , gabri@@ elle told me
i got beer for tonight . you@@ l excited ?
just threw it in the cart at the shop ' n save .
hey , so , it is your last chance to change your bet ,
she is a 13-@@ year-old
this is her year .
yeah , i have no idea .
so , i was thinking we could drink every time somebody asks
all right ? take a deep breath .
and it 's gonna be great .
it 'll make you last longer .
yeah , and i 'm feeling plenty of guilt then , too .
i 'm just .. really out of it .
i was having a crazy dream .
too bad the special olympics doesn 't have a comedy competition .
does anyone know the warning signs of a stroke ?
arthur , i thought you were gonna be here early .
hey .
i don 't really have a test tomorrow .
oh , no .
rob ! ah !
i have some more bad news for you .
can i confess something to you ?
what the fuck is happening ? !
that wasn 't yours to touch .
yeah , you should really listen to your girlfriend .
i mean , why do you pick on guys like me ?
i think you 're gay and you don 't
tommy 's gay .
the guys are super supportive .
yeah , i guess it would have been worse if you guys played a real sport , right ?
probably for the best .
you know , there are other
in this school , even .
i 'm talking about living a life without repercussions .
hey , didn 't your cousin get admitted to south o@@ aks ?
thank you for bringing that up .
you know , i just woke up this morning , and long story short , i
yeah , you guys go .

that 's a special sandwich , you little per@@ vert !
what the fuck is wrong with you ?
no . i was y@@ elling at my dick because it won 't get hard .
it sure sounds like it . do you want to watch ?
i really need to jer@@ k off , but it 's not working , and i
just help me or get the fuck away .
i 'm not in a good place right now .
i 'd do anything for you .
tracing the man 's slow fall into madness .
okay , let 's get started .
oh , no , if it 's okay , i 'm just ... i 'm gonna stand .
not gonna lie . today has been a never@@ -@@ ending cluster fuck .
but as i 've learned
you have a very impressive application .
i have lived to get into this school .
hell , at one point , i was so nervous i might have even over-@@ performed .
i don 't know . ii haven 't done this part yet .
you can do different things .
okay . all right . that 's great .
i don 't , but , uh , i 'm worried about you now , so ..
okay , um .
rob !
a mam@@ mo@@ gram .
oh , my god .
just forget it .
we can talk to the smar@@ test person i know .
like a jin@@ x !
ow should i know ?
well , if it 's not , then solve it for me
you have to figure out what made the curse start and fix it .
aw , mother@@ fuc@@ ker !
you know , i wanted to for , like , the longest time , and it
you know what could be really fun ?
okay .
yeah , but isn 't this better ?
and i 'm sorry ... white z@@ inf@@ an@@ del ?
okay , then you can get the fuck out of here .
can you drive ?

well , it 's too late to knock .

when i woke up this morning , i expected to be here tonight .
how 's it going up there ?
that is my geor@@ getown interviewer .
what are they doing here ?
just listen , okay ?
rob , leave .
u@@ gh ! this isn 't about angela !
but i obviously ruined all that , so ..
oh , shit .
you 're gonna start having feelings .
yeah , yeah . it 's his first bee , so ...
origin . that is a great stall .
oh , no . he 's implo@@ ding
oh , don 't be such a pus@@ sy . come on .

unfortunately , you 've gone
does anyone know where his mother is ?
when i had my lis@@ p ?
tell me .. what were we doing ?
hey , maybe we could re@@ create it
the residents of wi@@ ster@@ ia lane are nothing if not loyal .
they root for the home team ...
but the fier@@ c@@ est loyalty on wi@@ ster@@ ia lane
stop .
then you 're not going .
that woman sat our table , spent the holidays with us ,
does look a little neglected .
oh . i ... can 't do that .
oh , sorry . and sorry about the mess .
you look thin . are you eating ?
i 'm fine . i 'm a little behind on my chores .
paul , um .. are you sure you 're okay ?
good-@@ bye .
oh ! bob ! lee !
how fantastic is it that chris cav@@ an@@ au@@ gh is speaking ?
i 've heard him speak before . he 's even better in person .
me@@ g bul@@ ter . president of am@@ tech .
my husband is the c.@@ f.@@ o. of morris technologies .
what 's that mean ?
the seminars are only for participants .
hey , don 't worry .
attention !
b@@ ree .
i just came by to talk to ly@@ net@@ te .
she asked me to water the plants and collect the mail .
i never told a soul about your role that night ,
i understand .
we have so much catching up to do .
uh , wh@@ -@@ where are you staying ?
we 're going to be neighbors :
old friend ? you look like you 've seen a ghost .
your hand ! let me call you an ambulance .
martha ? y-@@ yeah .
there 's no doubt in my mind .
oh , please . i can get a face full of steam
i know , and i asked , and they said no .
tom , i 'm not a child .
i 'll decide what i want to do .
when i 've been five or six times ,
let 's go , mrs. sc@@ av@@ o .
this is why you keep us drunk , huh ?
this hits the spot .
i was talking about him .
well , maybe the dream is telling you to follow that impulse .
it 's natural to be concerned about him
it 's your call ,
paul 's very charming when he wants to be , and beth ...
well , didn 't you try to warn her ?
when he was released , when he had def@@ iled her ,
s-@@ so she killed herself ...
bast@@ ard .
beth would hate for all her friends
sol can watch him !
but i won 't let him destroy another woman
no , no , tell him he has a choice .
yes .
i guess that rule only applies to plus ones .
i wanna grab a soak before the keynote speech . bye .
huh ? oh , hi .
me@@ g butler . me@@ g .
uh .. great .
paul , you have to let me talk to you .
because you 're a mess , and someone has to do something .
dreams ? what kind of dreams ?
sure . no problem .
oh , no ! got it all over me .
in fact ..
so last time you and i had a meal together .
that was a long time ago .
susan ...
why do you care ?
hey . this is not about a cake . this is about trust .
do you have any idea how offensive that is ?
ah@@ h . there .
if only trust were so easy to make .
and they ... the@@ y-@@ they don 't wear underwear .
uh , do .. do you love this girl ?
but she knows how important star wars is to me .
how important she is to you .
shel@@ don , you-@@ you can see this movie whenever you want .
be with her .
great .
the two of them away together ,
well , if you think i 'm afraid of birds ,
you guys think the same way and we all come home .
this location 's been abandoned for 34 hours .
expect a violent reaction .
and let 's not forget , these are not hostile enemies .
they have the same goal we do ...
just like ebola .
what 's our eta ?
good .
someone is on the premises .
why didn 't he radio us directly ?
checking with ase ops now .
it 's been stalled too long already .
not stir up any public panic .
i am in command of this mission .
okay .
dr. mud@@ fly .
my lord .
there is great concern for her majesty 's health .
she 'll be lucky to last the week .
you got a dying queen ? not for long .
oh , uh , wait . wait for me !
shut up , blair !
ta-@@ ra .
you must let nothing pass her lips that hasn 't been made and served by you .
that 's us to the carriage .
very important .
stand back , everyone , while i secure the perimeter .
i do so admire how you don 't give up .
good luck .
no ! no .
oh , i can 't look .
do it again ! do it again ! do it again ! do it again !
so , while i remain here
you got me on the ropes , you have , che@@ ech .
jab , jab , cross .
i really don 't want to fight you .
it 's a therapeutic session .
stop worrying , john .
i 'll be back before you even miss me .
i think i 'm beginning to understand a little bit of what the animals are saying .
sir , i 'm afraid your obsession with dol@@ it@@ tle is .
i 'm not obsessed with dol@@ it@@ tle .
you 're the one obs@@ essing about my obsession with do@@ l ...
but luckily , i think i know where he 's going .
she had such a sure hand .
what did they offer you , mud@@ fly , to murder the queen of england ?
chair of the royal college .
blood rushing to my head . everything turning red .
thank you .
teamwork makes the dream work .
to put it simply ,
what un@@ ites such a group of creatures ?
.. we just belong together .
lily would have loved it , john .
i just got the chil@@ ls , and i 'm not even cold .
we know , o lord , that there is no word impossible to thee ;
i 'm sorry we couldn 't save you , your majesty .
in that case , i would use 1-@@ 0 nylon retention su@@ tures
because i would make sure the area
finished . yes , i know . i 'm sorry .
it 's very distr@@ acting .
if you get distracted this easily .
certainly calls it into question .
it 's just , no one can seem to make up their own mind today .
they just need a little help getting there .
okay , if someone comes to me with a problem ...
a metaphor ?
now the next time someone comes to you with a problem ,
see ? that 's the beauty of it .
you didn 't forget snack today did you ?
damn . and if they 're here ...
uh , lack of use ?
that 's right . it 's too late for this muscle .
they 've even gone into his heart .
at this point ,
dr. grey ?
what about an ab@@ sc@@ ess ?
well , apparently , you have ruled it out .
if you say so .
precisely my question , dr. yang .
and i a thousand times .
that 's ... fine , too .
m@@ m-@@ hmm .
you can take the exam again next year .
that was a trick question .
yeah , but my answer was wrong .
w-@@ what is he pointing at ?
the dra@@ pes ? yeah , she 's sterile .
infection spread to the ex-@@ fix .
get in here .
uh , her injuries were severe ,
i don 't want it .
it 's never an easy ride
am i clear ?

and i give the video camera to a homeless guy
he decides to be a dance instructor rather than a lawyer .
no , my son .
but what can you do ?
and when i came to , i jumped off the brooklyn bridge .
she jumps in the east river .

you were up with tom ?
no surprise after the way things went
oh , i don 't want to get in the middle .
why ? you catch him , uh , gr@@ ating cheese on his abs ?
must 've been pretty bad for you
i guess i was hoping ...
that one day i might out@@ grow all this .
i just can 't have him around . he 's too distr@@ acting .
and how would that happen ?
all i know is that not living your life isn 't the answer .
well , then get good , because take my word for it ,
cool .
uh , he and rene@@ e went out to dinner .
yeah . they went to that french restaurant dad likes .
oh , i want .
nah , i 've got plans tonight .
cool .
there ya go .
you know , you 're get@@ tin ' good as this .
i 'm also getting good at lying to my husband .
how 'd you find me ?
no . your answering service said i might find you here .
but he bought a mas@@ er@@ ati .
very temper@@ a@@ mental ,
i 'm no mas@@ er@@ ati , keith .
well , i 'm sorry about that ,
and the truth is , my life 's kind of a mess , too .
my house , not my life .
i really do sound like a mas@@ er@@ ati .
oh , my god .
the good news is ,
do you think you can offer me that ?
good .
but just so we 're clear ,
the way things have been going lately .
you 're welcome .
i think i like having you around .
it 's late , isn 't it ? yeah , our truck already passed .
sounds good to me .
good to meet you too .

it sent me into a bit of a rough patch .
yeah , no , i revised the plan to include the open staircase .

no . no
it 's going to come up looking real nice . it 's already great .
i should go and check on that .
oh , i don 't want to ...
like in , you know , information protection .
don 't know how to use it .
kind of widening out .
i want you to start rebuilding the business .
i just don 't want you to be stressed , honey ,
okay .
why do you get a name like we@@ ir@@ do ?
maybe .
breaking in to give us something ? it 's not very bright .
i hope his next gift is a su@@ shi knife for those fish .
ha@@ -@@ ha
the fish are beautiful . really beautiful . thank you .
you know , most people think that sam@@ my davis j@@ r. or nina sim@@ one
yeah .
my dad named him , actually .
i love you for it , but you know .
but he would offer an alternative , you know ?
so basically , eventually , you two need to have a conversation .
ye@@ p .
come on . i really don 't think that is the reason why .
why all the drop in 's and the stop by 's
i think you 're slightly exagger@@ ating .
i think he wants to nail you .
please know that i would never do anything to upset you both ,
you won 't hear from me again ,
turn it over . there 's more
but he seems okay , right ? other than that ?
so whatever this was , let 's put it behind us .
you know , what do you say ?
simon ?
i 'm glad you said that , ' cause
i thought we left all this back in chicago .
you got yourself a doctor too already ?
simon , i .
he made peace with us . i think that we have to make peace with him .
" cause i 'm not feeling good right now .
why would he
you 're probably paran@@ oid from the pills .
i didn 't take any .
no , i didn 't take any . no , i wasn 't .
this has nothing to do with pills
will you please just listen to me ?
rob@@ yn , it 's over .
and j@@ angles .
you asked me if there 's something i want to tell you .
is there something that you wanna tell me ?

oh , my god .
well , rob@@ yn , don 't
yeah .
i 'm going to take that too .
i don 't mean to interrupt .
goodbye . have fun , you guys .
bye . don 't let mom drink too much .
" put your mind at ease . this guy is a nobody . "
rob@@ yn , why don 't you just ask him ?
what are you going to do ?
simon 's sister said he was involved somehow
greg pier@@ son .
" simon , just after all these years , "
look , i think he wants to hurt us
if you were helping him ,
god , this is crazy .
she told me that he was found in a car with a
long time . i saw you up there . wanted to say hello .
i wanted to apologize .

well , i can type , and sco@@ field can 't see who 's sending him the messages .
but .. i 'm in school again .
i mean , it 's not the same
i guess i 'm just saying that ..
i just want to stay in one place ,
i , uh ..
okay .
i love you , too , son .
go down the hall , down the stairs to the basement .
the one on the left .
the judge comes to us .
do you see my clothes ?
my inhal@@ er is in my jacket pocket ,
i 've got a spare in my glove box ,
my mother was an asth@@ matic .
what the hell difference does it make ?
you 're a real piece of work , you know that ?
just one .
you just remember him .
i don 't know where they went .
yeah .
then find them .
the brothers come back to a city that 's 15 miles
maybe it 's because the president is
bur@@ rows is innocent .
as advertised .
you of all people should know that .
she 's the only one i spoke to .
we got to get as much of that in
everything 's going to be perfect .
excuse me .
as a way to keep ticket prices low ,
they tell you to meet them at the statue .
then they send you to the building
dan ?
and , yes , even shed a tear or two ..
i don 't know . , maybe he didn 't like the fact
okay , look , i know what a good person you are ,
i 'm , like , the sweet@@ est person i know .
yes , but once in a while ,
you one of those people ?
i-i think the coo@@ kie thing .
welcome back .
he puts the reading in your rainbow ,
to be honest , his research never amounted to anything .
how did your research turn out ?
hey , this is the apartment you get when you win a nobel .
i mean , maybe i come off a little strong ,
but there 's a difference between being tough
where ? to babies r us ?
okay , sorry . can we just go ?
oh , come on , they don 't hate you , all right ?
and if you touched the ground , burn you .
take that , glass ceiling .
one crazy ride .
i 'd like to share with you all one last use for a white flag .
good night .
shel@@ don ...
if you didn 't press record ..
well , that 's it .
and we still don 't know who framed him .
i guess the sad truth is ,
that 's a nice way of looking at it .
mom .. i want to meet him .
you were y@@ elling in your sleep .
i 'm .. i 'm doing a painting job .
shades of yellow that go in the kitchen .
now if you don 't mind , i 'm gonna go back to sleep ,
it 's so great visiting a retirement village ...
what do i got to do to get you to hurry it over , build a fence ?
i 'm sure you can find one somewhere .
oh , go ahead . i got time to kill while i 'm waiting
i love her . what do you think ?
frank ... is very to the point .
oh . what else you need to know ?
i never noticed that before .
that doll .
hec@@ k , i 've had her since forever .
i couldn 't bear to toss her , so there she is .
see you at the wedding , lor@@ ra@@ ine .
well , he 's quite a ...
for my son who dis@@ owned me .
i 'm tired of h@@ ating people .
what a thing to say .
you 're a decent man .
what is that again ?
okay .
you just need to identify what 's negative in your life ..
that sounds like a plan .
actually , i wanna talk to you about ga@@ by .
well , you know , we went through kind of a rough patch ,
girls , dinner 's ready ! i made your favorite ...
yeah , well , i don 't carry it around with me
ga@@ by , i want you to be happy ,
this is clearly about grace .
we 're not supposed to talk about her !
i 'm going to get ready for dinner .
i kept her warm for ya .
and obviously it involves keith ,
anyway , i 'm ...
mommy . i can 't find my ball .
how old is charlie ?
i had actually moved out before i realized i was pregnant .
i had actually decided to give up the baby ,
after that , it just never felt right to come back
so charlie is the only reason you came ?
maybe i ... was kind of wondering
you seem really great .
i think i have to .
i 'm still waiting on a few pieces ,
i 've been thinking about this room for 20 years .
i used to imagine the kind of room
i never knew you thought about kids .
it 's never too late . hec@@ k , if we can adopt ..
this is not the color we agreed on for the trim .
i can 't wheel her down the aisle to marry some jack@@ ass
well , you know , how can i put this delic@@ ately ?
someday soon she will die .
that 's a horrible thing to say .
you 're lucky you 're holding the baby .
if you don 't support her ,
yeah ?
and think about the example
now , look , tom and i have a little savings ...
but ..
nobody needs me anymore .
b@@ ree seems to think your wife planted it there ,
so you 've never seen this before ?
yes .
i 'm not comfortable around firearms , that 's all .
detec@@ tives , i know for a fact this is not beth 's gun .
should we take two blankets or three ?
what ? why ?
oh , shoot .
trust me , beth .
they 're so excited about finally becoming fathers .
is that .... . still the case ?
that didn 't sound very convincing .
okay , well , let me re@@ phrase it .
it was quicker than waiting for the gods to answer my prayers .
yes . their generosity knows no bounds .
dresses worthy of a princess . a new one every day .
a golden palace to raise our family .
well , this truly is a big day for the family .
king of all egypt !
gods .
my brother thought the after@@ life was a gift .
from now on , you have to buy your way in with riches earned .
it 's yours now .
i looked up to you .
that would be un@@ wise .
i thought your sight was perfect .
in the year that followed , many gods stood against him .
for mort@@ als , things were worse
those who prayed for him to save egypt were so@@ rely disappointed .
i had found z@@ aya ensla@@ ved to a cruel master .
i 'd like to drop him from a great height .
is theft always the answer ?
even if you could free me , what about my family ? our friends ?
you really believe the gods care ?
i want to show you something
the perfect time for someone to sne@@ ak inside .
they say hor@@ us ' eyes are kept there .
steal from a god ?
the plans should be here .
the source of his power . no fe@@ asts .
the treasure will pass through the front gate .
it 's what comes after .
come on .
he will pass over its peak and marvel
i 'm sorry ?
taller ?
well , that might be difficult , um , now , i mean ...
i suppose because i proved to be the best , my lord .
he shall see it from dawn to dusk .
oh , gold , gold !
a toast !
a toast to my legacy .
enough to make you afraid of your own shadow .
i pride myself in an orderly office , z@@ aya .
oh , and this pathetic little trin@@ ket of yours
it was all my idea .
give me back what you took .
i don 't need any more wor@@ shippers .
unless you brought more wine , get out .
what are you ? some thief ?
i have something set took from you .
go on .
there may be a way .
but the journey through the nine gates
if i kill set and take back the crown
my magnificent bloody ho@@ unds .
you are my children of iron and blood .
the rebel gods have cho@@ ked on our spears .
but you , my legi@@ ons of the desert , will bring them reck@@ oning !
and if you should fall in battle and travel the nine gates ,
oh , in that case ,
stay there . be quiet .
and put the mortal below deck if you want him to live .
you shall never feast on my creation !
things would be different if i could dwell
egypt must never be destroyed by chaos .
that demon isn 't the one who murdered my father .
and the uncertainty of its destiny is my will .
allow me to fill my fl@@ ask with these waters .
you plan to quen@@ ch the desert fire .
grant me the power to fly again .
i let you come here and i grant you passage home .
without both my eyes , i doubt i 'm strong enough to beat set .
have you been so lazy for so long
hey !
not worth the pap@@ y@@ rus it 's written on , hmm ?
i do not approve of how set rules .
lord , the last of the rebel gods have retreated behind her walls .
yes , sir .
she was your wife .
from now on , this will be the way of things .
better get used to it .
since you became king , the need for burial shrou@@ ds has been great .
you should know why i could not .
remember when you rode out of the desert .
and imagined the great deeds we would accomplish together .
some parts were sweet .
i still thought we could have been happy .
nothing can fulfill me .
why ?
maybe next time , keep flying until we 're actually on the ground .
i thought he was helping you .
the whole of the nile cannot quen@@ ch set 's fire .
kill the desert .
ho , 1 .. well , yes .
i 'm not going to risk looking at those tricky eyes of yours .
excuse me ?
i 'm not even half done .
the answer to the rid@@ dle of the sp@@ hin@@ x .
go ask the rid@@ dle and come back and relay it to me .
one ci us would have to die .
i don 't lie .
if i even attempted to explain ,
you tell me what kind of power do i really have ?
and i say we wait .
you 've always been in ha@@ th@@ or 's heart , you know .
room enough for a crowd in there .
she did it for love . you 'd punish her for that ?
i only ever wanted one thing .
but you , my lord , are bigger than most .
of course you are .
my duty was to help dead souls make their way to the after@@ life .
" seduc@@ ed " ?
this keeps them at bay .
but i can 't see you .
but how ?
in return , he 's going to help us .
i know , z@@ aya . i can hardly believe it myself
hor@@ us is a just god , as you said he would be .
well , yes . just a little bit .
you do know which is the door , right ?
no , no , it 's ... it 's that one .
perhaps we can help her .
it would require a very special treasure indeed .
i@@ ke this ?
you should have stayed under the sand .
of course you don 't understand . how could you ?
by the way , ap@@ op@@ his is going to eat the land of the dead .
me just telling you about mine .
the story begins on the fields of jamaica where ..
usually works , yeah .
just one , man , it 's just her .
this is the bul@@ war@@ k police .
ro@@ sal@@ inda , are you in there ?
gotta be aware of this stuff .
i do what i think best when i 'm out there .
there 's a reason i 'm sitting behind this desk running things
that wasn 't my point .
one thing before you go .
you threw a lot more ca@@ st-@@ iron than you needed to .
you weren 't that rough .
it 's not healthy for you
couple more years out there and you 're gonna be
i gotta go .
yeah . i can save it .
his cousins are gonna be there this time .
i don 't like doing things
but they was moved up .
do you think our wages accurately reflect what we did ?
i 'm smarter than you by a yard stick ,
gu@@ iet .
shouldn 't engage them here .
fifty percent .
any yes or no question .
" the bank will reopen in 15 minutes , come back then . "
this qu@@ y 's like a cigarette commercial .
i will .
not unless they 're cro@@ oked ones , looking for the gold .
just stay focused on your work .
it 's the pale sac in there , the one that looks like ...
careful not to pop his liver .
let 's dump him and drive .
this is the only deal you 're gonna get .
leave the bul@@ lion where it is and come on out .
you stay in the van , we 'll kill all of you ,
when you drove by the bank .
what do you want ?
so i can thank you face to face
go rob bank robbers .
i need the strap to stop the bleeding .
you want to get yourself a notebook .
it 's already infected your tongue .
ju@@ ka , what 's that about
they 'll make entry at approximately 2200 hours
why ?
surround the house , take him when he moves ,
i 'd take that as a compliment ...
we win this election and
the kid at the airport ,
come on .
you get the hospital , but that 's all .
ha@@ than , fuck of
do you want me to start on row two ?
yes , boss .
and that 's where it gets complicated .
the next day , they pick up ru@@ an
they 're going to make an example of him ..
because of you .
man can kid@@ nap , kill , rob
and he gets called a legend .
get good marks and all that ?
so you work hard , you do your best .
the only lasting thing about jacob ster@@ n@@ wood
i 'm thinking . you put it out there
okay .
yeah .
90 home , kiss your wife .
i was involved the second they pulled the trigger .
you are . i 'm gonna go track down this security guard ,
i mean , you want it new school or old school ?
that 's the way the gospel 's usually nowadays , cyber@@ -@@ sty@@ ley .
and rob .
i 'll show you fucking old school .
right , wait there .
so what are you saying ?
i 'm saying when i 'm given a new job
this may be nothing ..
they 've all heard that ru@@ an ster@@ n@@ wood is apparently
um , what 's the name of the company ?
alright .
but this is actually one of the largest container yards
this is sarah haw@@ l@@ ks , leave a message .
have you ever heard of someone called bar@@ tn@@ ick ?
the way they fired their guns ,
hey , honey .
this is for your benefit , max .
people in this city won 't be
jane , i 'm paid to catch cro@@ o@@ ks ,
gotta talk to you .
yeah , i can 't understand what you were doing there .
i had information , i acted on it .
maybe he was checking out a lead and needed protection .
but why two officers from separate divisions tw@@ inning it ?
what do you mean two officers ?
of course i didn ' .
ta@@ co@@ b ster@@ n@@ wood was there too
well , that 's not good enough .
i don 't give a fuck what kind of .. it 's fine mate ,
just tell him he 's a fucking mor@@ on .
relaxing at a murder scene ?
how did you know i was here ?
i 've been trying to call you , max . i 'm glad you turned up .
yeah , right .
give us two minutes , could you ?
what the fuck ?
deal with him or i fucking will .
walk away , ju@@ ka .
who killed my son ?
the ones in the club ?
who was she ? was she involved ?
why didn 't you just kill me in that tunnel ?
that 's the guy that focused on me at the club tonight .
i wish you had , nan .
come on , mate .
yeah , why not ?
we know how busy dean 's been keeping himself recently .
how we were the only ones to speak up and voice our disgust .
you were i@@ ke a rock .
yeah , you wouldn 't be involved
how 's your son ?
yeah , unfortunately , ru@@ an passed away recently .
ake him down to the punch for a few drinks .
so how do we do this ?
i get terrible mi@@ gra@@ ines . feels like my head 's gonna explode .
you don 't mind if i stay here and relax , do you , iris ?
maybe they can watch calamity jane .
i want to settle things .
when i close this down ..
told you before , i 'm wise to you ..
and you sit there in denial like some fucking royalty
i have to get this speech right with robert .
i hope this p@@ ans out for you , okay ?
bul@@ t warns can 't be reached .
you broke my fucking arm !
you can 't settle trying to set me up for murder .
right now you 're wanted for the murder of your partner
he was with bar@@ tn@@ ick and crown
and that compromised the deal .
bar@@ tn@@ ick and crown went to the hotel looking for their money .
and you suddenly get worried
this can 't just be about money .
robert wis@@ eman , he got it .
tane bad ham ?
i provided some manpower , turned a blind eye , you know .
because you wouldn 't shut up about it .
hey , guys , i 'm fr@@ ying to cook in here .
no , no , speak up .
z@@ ack 's here !
sorry . i really want to hear how sad you are .
sorry she made you come over here on a holiday .
plus , penny told me we 're married ,
can we just get this over with ?
okay .
why won 't you sign it ?
we don 't have any kids .
you know neither of us thought this was real .
of course it was an im@@ person@@ ator .
you married him instead of me ?
sign the papers .
you have been a jer@@ k about this all day .
and the blade high like this ,
once you 've gotten the hang of it ,
nothing to snee@@ ze at .
here , let me show you something .
little boy , are you okay ?
miss ! miss ! he lost his bathing suit !
i 'm fine !
i love your lim@@ o !
but , you know , w-@@ we can 't bail on my family again .
plus , cam , this will be fun , too .
that 's a bit direct , but , you know , he might be flat@@ tered .
fer@@ gus !
just had the worst fight with hugh .
i took a shot at russell cro@@ we in " les mis . "
he has to know .
let 's see . what do we got in here ?
i saw man@@ ny take sham@@ po@@ os from the hotel .
then some bigger things .
it makes my heart go fast .
a hair dr@@ yer . thanks , buddy .
s@@ onia , what are you doing here ?
we 're sisters . we shouldn 't fight .
you 've been doing it since i was 10 years old
can you be a human being for one second ?
well , that 's just a ref@@ lex .
oh , come on . where is that written ?
and then when cam thought
gl@@ oria , we can 't sit around doing nothing . call s@@ onia .
why would i make an exchange ? we have all the leverage .
what is she gonna do ? raise man@@ ny ?
there 's got to be a better way .
why does she want your sauce business , anyway ?
my late aunt
because papa loved me more ?
oh , my god . i guess so .
when you lose a love like that at such a young age ,
listen , if you want the hot-@@ sauce business ,
i want to give you something that is very precious to me .
it 's something that i should have given you a long time ago
but seeing how happy you make my grandson ,
now , let 's put this some@@ place safe .
do you want to do this ?
you know , it was nice of bern@@ ade@@ tte to offer ,
if you were in charge of her project ,
aren 't you always saving it 's about the work ,
plus , i 'd be working for bern@@ ade@@ tte .
that 's what makes you a good employee .
it 's just such a bum@@ mer .
you sure you don 't want me to call her ?
but , you know , just , u@@ gh , why ?
i remember .
and now , instead of losing our jobs ,
looks like my wife left me a month too soon .
what was his name again ?
shel@@ don , super-@@ asymmetry is your paper ..
mm , actually , the nobel committee has sometimes favored
yeah , that 's not gonna happen .
this discovery belongs to amy and me .
how long has she been like this ?
come to me
what do you know of what a spo@@ ok actually does ?
your answer .
it 's not that simple .
sometimes it 's just ... dust on a witch 's fingers .
your master was in love with a witch once .
close your eyes .
a failed spo@@ ok and a half-@@ witch ..
well , my mother taught me how to steal .
tric@@ ked her .
i thought that prison would hold her for eternity .
now everyone she kills in her wake is my burden .
this is re@@ bec@@ ca
you may do as you wish with the boy , my darling
beyond the forest .. pend@@ le mountain . we have three days .
dependable as death you are .
a bo@@ gg@@ art .
it belongs to my queen . how did you get it ?
don 't get up . i 'm fine . i 'm fine .
what :
what is this thing ? that thing ? the um@@ br@@ an stone .
makes their illu@@ sions seem more real
but it was stolen from her by another witch .
are you telling me that my mother is a witch ?
a witch 's son who is a spo@@ ok 's appren@@ tice .
must account for your visions .
we have a job to do .
you could have the whole place to yourself .
te@@ ddy bear could have his own room .
go , go , go ! race mama !
you can 't find a clearer station than that ?
i don 't know how to make it clearer to you .
you don 't make me anything .
shel@@ ley , let 's just ... .
the recep@@ tionist has gotta be around here somewhere .
hey .
charlie .
ni@@ kil@@ ki , what 's wrong ? where 's charlie ?
what the fuck ?
the recep@@ tionist . his face was ripped to pieces .
the mod now have confirmed fighter jets
they know there was something on board .
something like that fucking thing out there .
you think the government hasn 't known about this for years ?
whatever it is , it 's out there , on the loose ,
what do you think it wants ?
i can 't hear it anymore . think it 's gone ?
the shut@@ ters are locked .
wait . remember ..
all the power systems and wiring are in the basement .
well , there 's no way i 'm going back out there .
have you got weapons ?
but i do know where to find some .
but that still means we have to go out there .
ay . what you need to do is you need to get to the far end .
charlie . look , about shel@@ ley , things like this just happen .
listen ,
charlie .
it 's a dead end . it 's a dead end !
i mean , it might work for the japanese
i feel terrible .
i deliberately tried to sabotage stuart 's date with penny .
you completely scre@@ wed up your karma , dude .
it 's not supersti@@ tion .
oh , no , thanks . i have coffee .
um , i really don 't want to talk about it .
no . they can 't just cancel a show like alp@@ has .
fi@@ ref@@ ly did a movie to wrap things up .
heroes gradually lowered the quality season by season
ah , don 't .
i just .. i want this done .
that man was clearly a cowboy .
why do they keep hanging up on me ?
you know , shel@@ don , sometimes people seek the comfort
okay .
oh , that 's nonsense .
i don 't care how they end .
there 's a whole field of behavioral neuro@@ science
use it to your advantage .
well , that doesn 't seem fair .
no , it 's not .
so take what 's in that blog and use it to get her pants off .
why couldn 't you just say the blog is like
oh , look how cute your little dog@@ gy is .
if i give the right command in german ,
that 's quite an impressive layout , isn 't it ?
" let 's box it up . "
okay , shel@@ don , make a wish and blow out the candles .
now your wish can 't come true .
i didn 't think anybody actually read it .
i spent hours digging around online .
and your diabetic aunt seems
and i ..
ra@@ i , i didn 't say " feminine " was a bad thing .
i do have a-@@ pretty ball@@ s-@@ to-@@ the-@@ wall
you set me up !
i could have been arrested !
you stole some shit , you got away with it .
you really miss me ?
like , how much ? like , on a scale of one to 10 ?
you 're not gonna try and kiss me now , are you ?
o@@ oh !
before state , coach gave us key cards
it 's fine , don 't worry about it .
i don 't make the rules .
i heard that .
i didn 't jump , cal@@ vin .
well , you go first .
it 's not what she wants .
not like she sees them .
well , he@@ . he seems to be helping .
it 's not him that i 'm worried about .
of course if i buy them ,
oh , no . you have to go .
i thought i was a teen@@ y-@@ tiny wil@@ de@@ be@@ est .
wait . what are you talking about ?
she could fer@@ ret out pri@@ ya 's tactics ,
no . once these pupp@@ ies touch the ground
good news : the wil@@ de@@ be@@ est is in the curry .
bern@@ ade@@ tte is with pri@@ ya and leonard .
commence operation " pri@@ ya wouldn 't wanna be-@@ ya . "
what 's the word i 'm looking for ?
she 's also dating an astronaut .
yeah . but leonard 's impressive , too .
i 'm such a basket case , i can 't even talk to a woman
i have a big decision to make , and i 'm scared .
a friend at the school of pharmaco@@ logy
fascinating . what 's in it ?
some sort of beta-@@ bloc@@ ker attached to a molecule
that 's not the point .
i 'm a scientist .
i 'm afraid if i take this , i might lose
good gol@@ ly , penny , your wh@@ im@@ sy is bound@@ less .
i think they 're on to me .
calm down . everything 's going to be okay .
bern@@ ade@@ tte , i 'm putting you on speak@@ er@@ phone .
in the bathroom .
what 's the problem ?
you tex@@ ted me penny 's dating an astronaut .
auto-@@ correct must 've changed it .
all right , look , just forget about the astronaut .
look , just find out what 's up with this trip to india .
don 't you quit on us !
it was an architect !
you 're a good friend .
that 's what i strive to emulate .
can i help you ?

i 'm so relieved to know that i was the only one .
how wonderful you make me feel
i 'm too excited to lock myself away .
b@@ rice is away for the week , in paris .
i 'm sure swimming isn 't your favorite pas@@ time .
just need to buy a bathing suit ,
live dangerously , i say . you only live once .
you are a much better swimmer
to be born , to have committed no crime
yes , wei ling craw@@ ford .
good , splendid .
no ... well , yes , it is a ..
it 's much more than that , much more .
it 's philosophy , it 's religion .
he is pushing me very hard .
i mean , it 'd be logical .
you know , stanley ,
hmm . well , you could 've fool@@ ed me .
and you do have agreeable features ,
i mean , even you just said i have agreeable features .
provided the light hits you just so .
just in case i ever need to look my best for a job interview ?
of course i am .
do you have a date ?
i 'm going with the most charming woman in the south of france .
i like her .
maybe you and i can even have a dance together .
ah , your mental vibr@@ ations told you my feet are killing me
aunt van@@ essa ?
i 'm overwhelmed , sophie .
that 's more like it .
tell me , um , stanley .
have you not , in the .
well , i 've already told you ,
t mean as a woman .
what an odd question .
well , i was always certain you were not of my sex ,
i mean , comparatively .
you do understand , i 'm seriously considering
you don 't see it as
far beyond what you could hope , given your trivial resume
and most of your time will be spent with your ..
so the time that we 've spent together ,
you imagined that you and i ...
i mean , you 've conquered my mind .
i just thought , in the time that we had spent together
don 't mis@@ understand me . i .. i .
can you believe the little medium has grown fond of me ?
no , no , i mean .. i mean , she 's emotionally taken with me .
but you 're both spoken for .
well , it seems you 've given the matter some thought .
yes , to be sure .
come , i 've got to drive back to proven@@ ce ,
i came to un@@ mask her , as i have done countless others ,
know all the tricks .
what are her plans for the future ?
how does it feel to be wrong
so , it is fair to say that you feel
but it would appear that perhaps ,
it 's gonna be a world-class foundation .
i came at once , but she stum@@ ped me ,
and dam@@ ned if he isn 't her biggest fan .
i have some seriously di@@ stressing news .
your aunt 's been in a serious automobile accident .
she 's in critical condition at the hospital .
jacques .
this is stanley .
so , how 's she doing ? what 's happening ?
oh , she 's in the operating room now .
so what do you think ?
at this moment , it 's tou@@ ch-@@ and-@@ go .
you ... you can wait there , if you want .
is that right ?
oh , stanley !
you can imagine how anxious we were about your aunt van@@ essa .
me ? i didn 't even know .
if i had known ,
and , " all 's well that ends well . "
but now , after years of tra@@ iling in his wake ,
tho@@ w did
it 's a trick , sophie .
my reputation will suffer ,
've .
and you enjoyed life for once .
and we had some laughs together ,
sitting in your room and shu@@ ff@@ ling cards in front of a mirror ?
well , i started reading that book
think about it , stanley ,
and you won 't forgive me ?
only god can forgive you .
precisely my point .
" what doesn 't kill me makes me stronger . "
nevertheless , i think he was wrong .
i 've had another idea for our honeymoon .
i 've always wanted to visit bor@@ a bor@@ a .
some things need to be smooth@@ ed over .
yes , of course . yes .
i bet you 'll be glad to get back to london
you 're a great admi@@ rer of darwin 's .
and of course , you must miss oli@@ via .
such elegance and style .
we 're ideally suited .
and she 's quite attractive , to boot .
a very handsome couple indeed .
as you would say .
of course i love her .
me ? i never mentioned sophie .
sophie baker ?
exactly . that wret@@ ch .
well , you might .
the very idea of you and that speci@@ ous american tele@@ path@@ ic .
you , a creature of reason . a man of intellect .
certainly not trivial .
and she 's hardly in the same class as oli@@ via .
oli@@ via is a person of accomplishment and charm .
i regretted what i was doing
and i accept your forgiveness .
well , then just say it and go ,
that 's only because i fool@@ ed you
and as far as what i can offer you ,
i saw your arm . looks really cool .
i am not supposed to be in here , but i s@@ nuc@@ k in here like a nin@@ ja .
she ate some bad fish yesterday , so@@ . yeah
oh , sorry , got to take this . they are wondering if i can get some more info .
who ? what ?
they are experts on zom@@ bies . they live in america .
so they can come here ? just tell them to come right now to get the zom@@ bies .
come on . you can do it .
can i have my chocolate now ? there is no chocolate , kid
i got to get out .
it 's not what it looks like .
hello ?
bobby , u@@ h@@ h ..
is bobby there ?
and we will be heading your way shortly .
well , umm ...
do you mean our parents ? yes , our parents , but ..
got it
it 's time to go hunting .
not shoot mr. ol@@ sen . you shoot the dog !
boring .
what are you looking for ?
nice , huh ? do not touch the exhibit .
i hit it right in the eye . oh my god , oh my god .
first zom@@ bie scu@@ ad kill .
cheese ..
oh , we spoke on the phone . i am daniel . this is bl@@ ake and monica .
we tracked your iphone , of course .
what did you find out ? what do the creatures want ?
this is insane !
the force is strong with this one .
that sounds basically impossible .
yes , we need someone to attract their attention .
who knows these sw@@ am@@ ps and can move through them without getting stuck .
we 're getting close .
i don 't think that would help .
then i could get us out of here .
the rest in the garage with some ice cu@@ bes .
brief the guys . send photos to all the cops here in tal@@ vi@@ k .
odor and color .
for once we will shoot at something other that se@@ ag@@ ul@@ ls .
i mean , say we actually manage to wake these russians back to life .
i don 't know what 's gonna happen . but judging based on him ?
hopefully .
i 've seen a thousand zom@@ bie movies , and this is not in any of them .
look , i mean , if we are gonna go up against a battalion of nazi zom@@ bies ,
or what he did . we have to kill hi
her@@ zo@@ g killed sta@@ var@@ in and 50 of his men here .
ie@@ ow do we do this ?
i put my hand on his head .
master !
ie was first seen here
then he appears to be heading south . perhaps there .
a gang dressed as germans going crazy out there ?
and suddenly we have ra@@ gn@@ ar@@ ok on our door@@ step .
there is no one here . we have sent them away .
since you can 't complete your mission ,
don 't you get a bitter feeling when somebody you thought were dead
troops !
je ' s kill them all !
nick took care of it by sky@@ pe this morning .
okay , let 's begin .
here 's a demo .
now close the deal .
it 's the way the kids say " what 's next ? "
i-i have no idea how it happened !
it seems clear this offence was committed ,
climbing the statue of the duke of wellington in the city centre .
he seems to bear a gru@@ dge against public monuments .
get it prepared for painting after wards , all right ?
don 't take the p@@ iss . get the scra@@ pers ,
in the corridor . get started as soon as you can .

brother omar , the answer lies within your question
they had those cargo containers , like a hospital ward ,

he 's dead so what
this money is blood soaked . the blood of inno@@ cents .
im@@ ti@@ az , what have you done ?
sir , the pakistani saw me opening ta@@ w@@ fee@@ q 's bag
you mean ' you ' ?
i have a lot of emotional baggage
nice , really nice .
he@@ y. rose .
she took it so well at the beginning .
civilized is out
now she 's got delayed rage .
she was being big before putting on a brave face .
like 3 men who 'd be married to those ladies in the ball go@@ wns
just like when you had pete you remember ?
but you will love me later when there 's virtually no scar .
three gentlemen in a lim@@ ous@@ ine
oh , no .
which is across town .
we can do that ?
and , uh . if i were you , i would insist .
the good grey ?
and i 'll throw in o '@@ mal@@ ley .
phil ?
the lim@@ o hit a patch of ice .
i can 't feel my legs .
oh , sir , dr. ha@@ hn is working on multiple crash injuries
to check on my other patients .
hello ? vincent ?
every 30 seconds , her memory res@@ ets every 30 seconds
how you doing ?
i know , it 's just .

so we consider him a good teacher right ?
there 's a problem with the insurance .
i know , micha@@ eli called them and the credit card company
i ... i don 't understand .
is there something i can do ?
i ... i don 't .
if you can just tell me .
i 'll talk to billing and see what i can do .
it 's stuck .
you 're a little mean to george un-@@ unnecessarily mean
why are you talking to me ?
you thought that makes us friends ?
he 's not my boyfriend .
you do .
shut up
please .
shut up .
no . why ?
oh the sof@@ ter side of alex .
he 's stable but still critical .

without my consent ? no , i don 't think so .
get out of my patient 's room !
listen you arrogant little
oh gentle gentle , gentle
how 's mr.@@ ken@@ ner ?
i 'm doing my best hold still .

did you mean what you said about me and derek ?
i 'm imp@@ aled a
that is unprecedented in the me@@ red@@ ith chronic@@ les .
fine .
got you .
goes with the story of how i cut my hand .
i-i didn 't say anything .
okay okay
he 's down to 90 degrees .
i think it 's too low
do they recommend li@@ do or ami@@ od@@ ar@@ one ?
all righ@@ t.@@ looks like we have some warming to do .
um it kin@@ da looks like it 's hitting nothing ?
because it 's hitting nothing !
we just couldn 't bring him back .
none of you .
and you walk around this hospital like it 's your go@@ d-@@ given right to be here .
you are here because i allow it .
so what , you don 't make mistakes ?
today i killed a man because i couldn 't do a sti@@ tch .
it 's about something . it 's not about being the best . it 's about saving lives .
and i don 't know everything . nobody does .
and the next time . i don 't make that mistake again .
mistakes are how you learn .
my head@@ . hurts .
betty you and vincent were in a car accident .
no , no , please .
it hurts . what happened ?
it happens . people make mistakes .
and i think you 're off to a good start .
he was ready an hour ago .
fine .
it 's tomorrow .
i 'm sorry about the hand .
not to me they don 't , or they didn 't before you existed for me .
every doctor in this hospital wanted me in their o.@@ r .
and now i 'm the crazy girl out of fatal attraction
you 're never at a loss for words with your patients .
you don 't seem to have any trouble letting me know how you feel ,
when i like somebody . i make sure they know it .
what if he doesn 't like me back ?
what 's ... what am i doing here ?
did something happen ?
oh , right .
you should ditch this place and go for the adventure .
yeah . yeah , it does
uh . dr. yang took good care of me excellent care .
i also heard a story that you constructed an o r. table
you have to be innovative everywhere .
i don 't have anything to compare it with@@ .i ...
so you 're fre@@ aking out , too ?
yeah . i don 't do therapy
well , not much , i expect , unless i can convince you
no , thank you , sir .
more a matter of content . you don 't seem to care much for our profession .
i 've read your books . neither do you .
you got it right in kentucky blood .
but cold denver morning , you got it wrong .
look , that wasn 't my fault . all right ?
now , this town doesn 't need that . it needs to heal . it needs to forget .
well , there 's a missing girl involved here .
then i guess we should just let it go , huh ?
something like this ... you can never explain something like this .
now , we did our job . you 'll see that .
if writing true crime has taught me one thing ,
well , i 'm gonna go out on a limb
oh , and ... i find this to be in extremely bad taste .
he wanted an auto@@ graph , but he left his copy at home .
yeah .
no , not yet .
no , i thought i 'd set up my office first and get started .
just an hour or two .
oh , god , i don 't know . it could be a long one .
it should be in my back@@ pack .
oh , fuck .
tre@@ vor , don 't walk away from me . ashley , close the door .
i 'll tell you again . i wasn 't thinking .
you wanna be treated like an adult , but you don 't act like one .
you don 't know what you 're talking about .
go to your room !
fine .
i didn 't say you were a .... you know .
i 've taken my fair share of forensic science courses .
look .... .
but if you want me to run interference for you while you get this worked out ,
it 's my home , mr. o@@ sw@@ alt .
all right . come here .
i don 't know . that 's what i 'm hoping to find out .
maybe .
yeah , or his 60s .
i don 't know .
toxico@@ logy reports , some cases the killer dru@@ gged his victims .
well , they couldn 't tell for sure .
here he used a tree branch to do the heavy lifting .
my god , what on earth possessed you to move here ?
this place came on the market . it was a steal .
so what tre@@ vor drew last week , that happened here ?
the previous owners of this home were hung from a tree in our backyard ?
really ?
and play dates for her kids ..
it was fun !
well , they look fine to me .
same time next week ?
the loved ones who traveled alongside us ..
and those waiting for us on the road ahead
let me see . oh .
oh , come on . tro@@ t her on out .
actually , l think i 'm starting to feel pretty zen
i can 't even blame him for h@@ ating me
i 'm with you . carry on .
somewhere down the line ,
i 'm fine .
oh . well , i mean , when two people split up ,
i 'm sorry .
look , are you sure this is what you want to do ?
you 're like the first 14 chapters .
i 'm gonna be honest .
it was just awful .
his mother and her friend were there with champagne .
well , there 's something comfortable about george .
oh , and best of all , he loves the opera .
no harm , no foul .
we 're two old friends who suddenly find themselves single .
a little less lonely .
i 'll be back on friday to pick your guys up .
yeah , um , before that happens ...
she 's getting so big
pleas@@ e. tell me the kids didn 't see it .
right before you took off your bra .
oh , nor@@ ma . it 's okay .
you 're just having fun@@ .@@ lf 's nothing to be ashamed of .
at one point we actually talked
thank you for being so open-@@ minded .
guess i owe you an apology .
i 'm still gonna need some proof .
what happens in nine months ?
now just so you know , stan ,
well , don 't wanna wait too long .
well , for starters , he knows the last thing
but you should know that .
dr. gold@@ fine has other concerns about us being together ,
i 'll agree with dr . gold@@ fine on one thing .
really ?
i 'll talk to dr . gold@@ fine about it tomorrow .
not good .
okay . we can 't pan@@ ic@@ .@@ cal@@ eb is scared .
which yards haven 't you checked yet ?
oh , dear . what 's wrong ?
well , that was a waste of time .
did you hear the big news ?
karl and i are back together
there 's some stuff that i have to say ,
whatever it was that you said to him really helped .
ga@@ by , if i make it any tighter ,
i can 't have these girls thinking i 'm pregnant .
trust me . they 're mer@@ cil@@ ess .
when i decided to marry carlos ,
tell gabri@@ elle i 'm sorry i backed out of the show .
helen ! helen , you 're here .
there 's a special place in hell for people like you .
you 're an adult . take some responsibility !
she is wearing a dignified classic ,
edi@@ e brit@@ t , everyone !
yes . if you like .
you seem angry at my good fortune and i thought we were friends .
well , i was actually just te@@ asing . i thought you 'd see that .
well , it will , if i build it using the finest cl@@ al@@ t@@ smen in the land .
prime minister , we need to discuss who will go to the french with the peace treaty proposal .
so they will give in to us .
i upheld my party together , as we the country
the french were ch@@ ast@@ ened but not defeated , har@@ ley .
make them sue for peace with broken hearts and begging backs .
sweet and right .
we must take it to the queen .
i liked your father .
then i guess he did .
when i was fifteen , my father lost me in a card game .
this one here .
lady mar@@ l@@ borough .
yes , lady mar@@ l@@ borough .
must the duck be here ?
hor@@ atio is a prize worth stealing , it is not leaving my side .
and how are we going to pay for this ?
this is madness .
she relies on you and your love of england to holds the tories together .
the love of your country ?
look , the dead pile up , as do the resent@@ ments .
i gri@@ eve them all .
in my heart , a scar for each ,
there is always a price to pay .
throw .
when it crosses your eye , pull the trigger .
perfect !
are you following ?
you seemed to be following me , sir .
that was you i saw on the horse that morning ?
where would i get a horse ?
perhaps it was you .
it 's like a monster attacking me .
i don 't think so , your majesty .
the queen and lady mar@@ l@@ borough are to race lob@@ sters . and then eat them .
queen is going to announce for the doubling of the land holders tax to parliament .
i don 't think she 's certain of it though .
and the fields would have run with blood , as the
ag@@ ian to our queen ,
you have become close to ab@@ ig@@ ail .
it is such a shame but ' ve had to dismiss her for theft .
she 's my servant , she 's not dismissed .
did you not hear what i said ?
yes .
you will dismiss her .
i like it when she puts her tongue inside me .
it 's good for you .
what if i should fall asleep and slip under ?
oh , then i shall die happy .
do not scratch at her .
mr mor@@ ley .
how handsome you are , mr fre@@ eman .
perhaps i was not making a point .
perhaps some mal@@ formation of my heart .
i must take control of my circumstance .
so kind .
anne .
oh , we should ask people .
this is not how matters of state are dealt with .
would you leave mar@@ l@@ borough exposed ?
do not shout at me . i am the queen .
is the queen not riding today ?
i have thought on the terms of our friendship .
i will get you an audience with the queen if you ask her a favour for me .
har@@ ley you did not need me as an enemy .
true .
the war with the french will ble@@ ed us dry even if we win .
the people hate the war , you realize
no , she has not .
of course .
i must talk to you of your maid also .
i believe that is her name .
she 's just a maid .
we need
this cannot wait .
is it a bit like going late to your party ?
but if it 's going badly , you cannot save it ,
i am sorry prime minister , passing thought .
i have told you before .
she probably went back to south ham@@ pton .
to plan what ?
i am as hard as a rock and it is our wedding night .
in his newspaper , the next day ,
and for you .
you 'd do that ?
do you not wish to know what i 've decided ?
the queen requested the return of your key .
where is she ?
you must stop it go@@ dolphin .
indeed , but he would have launched us into a bloody
a new era of peace and prosperity , a new day , a door to a new future ,
thank you all .
i shall leave a gap in the conversation for you to remedy that .
this cannot be all of it .
don 't lean on me .
perhaps it was lost , or eaten mice in the long journey .
yeah , they 're helping me get pregnant .
ye@@ p , he 's po@@ ked more famous people than john ma@@ yer .
tell you what , i 'm gonna do what i used to do
max , do you think ran@@ dy invited me to dinner

um , no .
what 's that ?
oh , it 's a snow@@ fla@@ ke from the north pole .
oh , god , that is so romantic .
but he just gets on my nerves .

apparently , when i put someone down for a nap ,
i 'll get it .
i 'm bad at a lot of things .
um , i changed my mind .
how much time is left ?
oh really ? he 's not reacting at all .
oh , he 's smiling . i 'm doing it .

they 're going to have to secure four pins into your skull
i want to hear this , lin@@ c .
uh , another ct scan .
and once you have that ?
they 'll fit you with a helmet ,
all right .
so ..
cause these are the latest in he@@ at-@@ sensing technology .
it 's amazing .
the company doesn 't want any record of what 's going on down there .
no , it 's right in the middle
it 's fortified with steel fibers , just like you said .
we have to generate an electromagnetic field ...
i almost wish there was a ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y desk in here .
take off this jacket .
i didn 't bring it with me .
that is what you 're looking for , right ?
i 'm the one that taught you how to lie .
why did you feel you needed to steal my card ?
who are you selling it to ?
wouldn 't take off her jacket for a thousand dollars .
it 's a complication .
relax .
i was guaranteed 50 grand .
i have a job .
people call me sir .

am i the only one hearing alarm bells ?
how out a champagne fountain ? oh , i know !
well , the do@@ ves are not going to release themselves .

you would think that , but no .
this is something that we have both looked forward to for so long .
oh , i guess .

again , not liking those odds .
i 'm trying to talk to your aunt lucy !

i 'm entitled to walk in the countryside ...
.. without having to encounter
bullying my girlfriend .

it should be for people that at least respect the countryside .
people like you ...
you know , 300 years ago
hmm , i hadn 't thought of it like that . thanks .
ginger
yeah . with me .
i 'm not a bloody writer , am i ?
that 's what you are .
it 's not my style ! just ... all this .
you did this to me . god !
i need justification .
oh , honestly , i 'm so happy i bum@@ ped into you guys .
so , you know , and , uh , i really bonded with little ban@@ jo over here .
that 's his name , isn 't it ? it 's just that chris said it was ..
so did i get that wrong ?
uh , no . no .
r@@ ine .
yeah , i imagine , yeah , yeah .
really ? right . i ...
haven 't you got lovely eyel@@ ashes ?
m@@ mm .
martin , did you hear me ?
stand by .
sir , we may have another attack .
i need an update on delta .
you just get them in there . i mean ..
because there is no helicopter .
we just need them to be on standby ...
i understand , but it 's too dangerous .
arms out to the side ! come forward !
down on your knees !
arms up ! cu@@ ff him !
down over there !
we have a young male with multiple gun@@ shot wounds .
blood pressure 's dropping . sixty-@@ thirty .
can you tell me what 's on it ?
i sent it out so people will understand what i 've done .
we need to know if there are more attacks planned .
so , i needed to do emergency surgery on him .
there are several bullet fragments close to his brain stem .
that means if he survives ,
my parents divorced am@@ icably when i was very young .
i maintain a close relationship with my mother .
i was too focused on my career ,
my mother had nothing to do with this . she 's not relevant .
how many children do you have , mr. lip@@ pe@@ stad ?
yes , of course .
so , he buys 900 kil@@ os of fertilizer and aluminium nitrate ,
when he attacked them , he attacked us all .
hello .
i 'm going to make sure you and your family rot in hell .
this will be led by one of oslo 's leading lawyers , mrs. alexan@@ dra ger@@ ig .
this inquiry is of vital importance .
if we fail to do so , the terrorist will surely win .
it was from the office .
yes ?
two or three years .
that could be fatal .
do you have any questions for me , vil@@ jar ?
i 've allowed the families to take control .
i have to prove that these attacks meant something .
i have to finish what i 've started , and standing up in that court ..
that 's the whole point .
he wants to change his defense .
has he given any reason ? i mean , why ?
and he knows the consequences .
the psychiatric assessment was clear .
how do we get around that ?
just tell me what i need to do .
i want to begin to explore to what extent government was aware
the security services told me they had no warnings ,
we have discovered that mr. bre@@ ivi@@ k 's purchase of chemicals
that was not what i was told , madam chair .
you can turn to tab three .
were you aware of these discussions ?
mr. bre@@ ivi@@ k , you told the police that this organization
i don 't know . i get a good idea , like why don 't i write about my dad ?
who wants to read about , " he was disappointed in me ...
he needs to go outside a lot , breaks up my day . that 's why i 'm not writing
can i have bobby now ?
cal@@ vin ...
that he would help me meet people .
that he would be awesome and we 'd take hi@@ kes and stuff
does that embarr@@ ass you ?
i can 't write . okay .
of the new york times best seller list , uh , for several months .
and , uh , how can i go back in time and be him ? "
since then , of course , we 've all enjoyed his short stories ..
now available in a beautiful 10th anniversary edition ...
we are lucky to have him around .
phenomen@@ al , man . just brilliant . thank you . thanks .
cal@@ vin . hi .
she 's a person .
you 've written a girl . all right , whatever .
i might not even finish it .
listen . i 'm not saving you can 't write .
.. you don 't know jack shit about women .
this thing is dri@@ pping everywhere
you 're so not my type .
i was young . you must have things you regret .
everything 's been perfect so far . oh .
ruby . jump !
i thought you were the most beautiful girl i ever saw .
how can you ask that ?
when she touched me , i could feel it .
that 's great .
i cannot deal with your shit right now .
the nic@@ ht you met me ?
never mind . ha , ha . never mind .
i can 't really talk about it . right , of course .
right , but if i am ?
do you wanna go some@@ place ?
do you wanna go to my place ?
i 'm sorry . what 's going on ?
do you wanna get out of here ?
do you know this girl ? yeah . hi , i 'm ruby , cal@@ vin 's girlfriend .
i 'm having trouble processing it all , okay ?
don 't go on a date with another girl .
what is going on with you ? i don 't know . i 'm sorry .
.. wrapping my head around the reality of this situation .
look , i know it 's a lot to take in , but you have to believe me .
i don 't know how or why ...
and i like it .
are you fucking serious ?
i 'm not seeing things .
i told him when she was a character . he won 't understand .
harry , don 't laugh at me .
some girl wanted to get close to you , somehow got her hands on what you wrote .
if it does , then you 're right and this is a fucking miracle .
.. maybe we go to the police .
you act normal . i 'm not gonna say ..
were you guys getting st@@ oned out there ?
it has to be something we notice right away , okay ?
what she 's wearing ? yes . yes .
what was she wearing ?
i got it .
write that she speaks fluent french .
i can 't really take credit .

and let 's just say , hypothe@@ tically ,
a sort of " sorry for fucking you over " money . huh ?
robin .
maybe ' cause you just knocked over a nine-@@ year-old little chinese girl .
you never prey upon the virtuous or the poor .
and you never , ever betra@@ y your family !
there 's always an angle with you , man .
you think this is about money , crunch ?
think again .
just because he says he 's sorry doesn 't make him a changed man .
wow ! she 's good .
no . crunch needs this .
oh . well , what i understand is that ,
take care .
what did ya have in mind ?
that 's where the motorcycle k@@ icks in
in and out in 4.@@ 25 minutes .

no , no , no . let 's stick with ten . let 's not get greedy here .
today . now .
i just need money .
oh , no , no , no , no , no .

and if you want these to pass the carbon dating and the professional scrutiny ,
with our buyers , most certainly .

if we pull this off , you can buy ten of ' em .
listen , i gotta think about it . i wanna run it by l@@ ola .
don 't talk to me about lost time , nick@@ y .

ok . great , we 're all here .
during that time period paddy will have made the sales ,
in a month 's time , we 'll contact amsterdam ,
all right .
they 'll pass carbon dating , expert analysis , everything .
they 'll just need to look convincing
why .. why bother working that lot at all ?
this way , you and i can split it two ways

yeah , but then he delivers his books
i won 't be around .

ol@@ ga something
have you ... have you seen paddy ?

nick@@ y boy ,
all i did was drop off a sculpture .
i just needed to plant the idea and let his imagination do the rest .
i 'm not a cop . but these guys are .
look who we have here .
" model , re@@ ar-@@ view , " 1887 .
uncle paddy could come up with ten buyers easily .

we know what you were doing .
oh , you were breathing , all right .
i don 't know what you 're talking about .

and you didn 't tell us ?
i thought we were friends .
no , we wouldn 't ! i told you when i was

we must all of us , on this train of life ..
of course you wouldn 't wear a shoe on your head .
a shoe belongs on your foot
i belong on the head , you belong on the foot .

education ?
i 'll miss our late night phone ch@@ ats .
all with only one arm .
what 's the matter ?
you see those cables ?
die !
i think it is easier for someone to survive on this train ..
if they have some level of insan@@ ity .
we need to maintain the proper balance of anxiety and fear ..
if we don 't have that , we need to invent it .
sit down !
now , i got two bodies back at the trailer .
who knew about the buy ?
if i tell you , he 's gonna kill me .
alright guys , i want a fair and clean fight . alright ?

look , the affid@@ avi@@ t is on file at the clerk 's office .
but as for me
guards ! get me out of here .
that you truly understand the meaning of death .
but you know what those mis@@ fits did , the first chance they got ?
this country is built on the barrel of a gun ,
we are the poor with guns .
death before dis@@ honor .
or just simply fre@@ akin ' stup@@ idity ?
get him on his feet .
we 've got cops .
you want me to say i killed ' em ?
to turn a blind eye from some of his business affairs .
a very selfish thing to do .
well for your grandson 's sake , you better hope they do .
it 's best served cold
no , i was thinking about that other one .
an eye for an eye .
you go back and get him !
ge out of the car ! get out of the car !
hey , man . r@@ uck ! i 've got to go to the hospital , man .
don 't shoot . don 't shoot
so bring frank in and let him clear his name .

if you have any explaining , you can do it at the station .
raise your hands , detective .

you played your hardest . that 's what matters .
okay , listen .
i 'll get the generator going

a lot of this country is still free and up for a fight .
we 're only 50 , 60 miles from the border .
and other places , too , sw@@ inging back our way .
tex@@ as-@@ mexican border has been burning for weeks .

looks like we 're in business .
maybe , but we should talk about
but you can 't just give up . breeding season 's soon , right ?
i 'm just .. i 'm not ruling anything out .
if bradley 's projects in town go well ,

this might be my und@@ o@@ ing as a mayor ,
when i point out how exposed the entire whale development is
i didn 't become mayor for nothing .

it 's 30 days behind .
my house has been paid for for over four years .
what are you talking about ?
did you find a body ?
so you assumed that this was blood loss .
well , can your dna test determine when that blood was left there ?
so it 's a possibility that the blood

the weather , the plants and pests . especially pests .
hello my love .

dangerous . and sadly , our last craf@@ tsman ...

he was always quite shy .

little by little , and then all at once
dear jesus , mee@@ k and mild , watch over this small child .
god bless mommy . god bless dad .

they live so for 20 years ?
you will probably crazy in this house ?
i know you bra@@ hms can not leave , but i will not tell
professional courtesy because we work for the same people .

my sister took me to the hospital .

i 'm sorry i 'm such an exceptional surgeon
okay , well , yeah , come on up .
my company designs the men@@ us for the chees@@ ec@@ ake factory .
well , my dad . but me and my sister are v@@ ps .
i know it sounds easy , but there 's a lot of science that goes into designing them .
it 's a time of day i invented .
i 'm fairly certain it will catch on as it fills a desperate need .
i would snor@@ t in deri@@ sion and throw my arms in the air ,
but we@@ -@@ we put all your vital information into this dating site ,
even assuming you could answer any question the way i would ,
capable of devastating a major city .
they were identified as low level chechen separatist .
by enabling acts of terror
normally , you and your team would be tasked
and now we know who you are .
pursue us , you 'll be caught . resist us , you 'll be killed .
good luck , mr. hunt .
mr. chairman , the t@@ m@@ f 's
in fact , until this panel appoints a new secretary ,
mr. chairman , the so call impossible missions force
from where i sit ,
" what are you doing here ? "
want to see what is done .
there are men who can be broken in different ways .
he 'll die , before you turn him .
you should go , before it gets ugly .
you should go .
do you , jan@@ ik .
follow me
i 'm going to find him , bran@@ dt . and when i do ,
set your watch , bran@@ dt .
all right , everybody . heads up .
alpha team pre@@ p . standing by .
lang@@ ley bri@@ m@@ stone , go .
lang@@ ley , there 's nobody here .
another one van@@ ishes here is flight 606 ?
is it that time already . okay .
i know and i 'm gonna answer truth@@ fully .
i 'm actually third in line to the throne .
why would he contact me ?
tell me what you make of them .
look at the photographs , dun@@ n .
all of them were government agents .
these are highly classified
i wonder how ?
that thought had cross my mind .
you seem to thinks i have some kind of obligation to him .
e@@ than hunt is still out there in the field , and i 'm stuck here answering for it
that 'll be all , dun@@ n .
e@@ than , where are you ? where the hell have you been ?
everything is going to be fine . just keep walking
for your sake , we shouldn 't be seen together .
but isn 't this taking the role a little too far .
oh . we haven 't formerly introduced .
tl@@ sa fa@@ ust . you 're e@@ than run@@ t .
new identity , passport , cash , road map .
everything you need to make it to dc un@@ detected
it 'll go easier if you tell them what they want to hear .
him .
missing , presumed dead
former mo@@ ss@@ ad .
tonight , i made it official .
the same day a car accident killed the visiting f@@ president of malawi .
hours before a passenger plane vanished over the pacific
right before a fired petrochemical plant g@@ assed a village of 2,000 people .
that missing plane was carrying the secretary of the world bank .
i can 't protect you .
it 's not your decision to make , e@@ than .
all i know about you is that you chose to work for hun@@ ley .
you don 't have to worry about e@@ than .
this is the cia , this is hun@@ ley we 're talking about .
they 're going to kill e@@ than . they 're going to kill ben@@ ji .
you need to understand something .
i believe you
not much .
his name is solomon lane . he created the syndic@@ ate .
he 's former british intelligence .
syndic@@ ate was created by one of their own .
so that the other one can access the computer without being caught .
can i get in through there
in the pipeline . and before you ask .
no oxygen tanks .
well . then , you just have to hold your breath for 2 minutes .
so , i have to hold my breath for 3 minutes ?
the more you exert yourself , the faster you consume oxygen .
all he has to do is install the fake profile before i get to the ga@@ it analysis .
that doesn 't sound impossible .
so , how are we suppose to find e@@ than and ben@@ ji before they do ?
so where are we going ?
the syndic@@ ate 's entire infrastructure .
it 's everything you want to know .
why would lane want it so badly if it wasn 't authentic ?
did you never stop to consider he may want me to have it ?
even after you gave him the disk ?
that 's a le
they don 't care if you live or die .
i hope you would .
i 'm listening .
now say the words , please .
i will help you capture him .. alive . that is the deal .
stay with him .
last time we spoke , you were hunting rogue agents in morocco .
i 'm listening
sold ! to our generous chair@@ woman .
he says it 's urgent .
it 's a matter of national security , sir .
yes sir .
who is this man ? why is he after me ?
agency which is since been dissolved .
but new intelligence suggest that he 's been
and if you don 't mind i asking ,
he came forward with first hand knowledge of the plot against you .
he believes it is the key to bring down the syndic@@ ate
and it was , prime minister . i can assure you .
i don 't understand . prime minister , your life is in danger .
sir . does the name , solomon lane , ring a bell ?
so , there actually is a syndic@@ ate ?
recruit former agents from other nation@@ s. supply them with a new identity
i rejected the proposal unequivocally .
prime minister , there is no any syndic@@ ate .
there is no secret he cannot extract no security he cannot breach .
he has mostly likely anticipated this very conversation
prime minister .
sir , please step away from the prime minister .
att@@ lee shot me
desperate times , desperate measures , sir .
do you know who i am ?
but lane went rogue and turn it against you , didn 't he ?
that 's why you er@@ ased the disk which she brought it to you .
now , director hun@@ ley has some questions for you regarding i@@ isa fa@@ ust .
no one is arguing that , but you are asking us
you will confess .
if you vo@@ w to support the church ,
s@@ cone may be dangerous .
for the people , it must be s@@ cone .
s@@ cone it is .
and now the real test begins .
your majesty .
that murderer is no king of mine .
the prince and his envoy are on their way ,
but today is a sunday .
tomorrow then .
the man 's a bloody beast .
i can handle myself .
shouldn 't you wait for the prince ?

he was dead i swear .
there was a blue bag here with my shoes in it
and my tas@@ er .
in fact there was a whole cache of guns ! what the hell ?

and nobody believed , but he was like that .
we went to this place in wales to make a competition .
yes .
and sharing it with all my friends and with my father .
my father , he says , " listen .
and i say , " okay , if you say so , i will do that . "
so , how did you get your first part in an opera ?
and my debut was the 29th of april , 1961 ,
it 's love . it 's passion . it 's very beautiful . it 's casual .
and desperate , because there is@@ . that is there .
i sang there in 1963 with great success .
if you want to become luci@@ ano pav@@ aro@@ tti ,
you can have a beautiful , nice life of the ten@@ or ,
everything .. everything was easy .
it was super clear , like a photograph .
a ten@@ or singing a high c makes your ears vibr@@ ate .
we all dreamed to be the most important in the oper@@ atic world .
so i was the first boy after six years
everybody was looking for me .
i think luci@@ ano loved women . and he also trusted them .
suddenly , in between my relationship
that was certainly an important point
everything became more geared towards mass appeal .
yeah .
there 's so much repertoire .
one of us suggested , " why don 't you do this one and i do that ? "
so , to pick , you know , between the sadd@@ est and so and so .
you know what kind of determination , you know what kind of fears
it was okay , like , " anything you do , i can do better . "
" boy , what a phrase you did . now let me do this one . "
it 's kind of hard to over@@ state what an impact that had .
the three ten@@ ors transformed three guys
at the age of 60 , he shouldn 't do such things .
divorce at that time was un@@ thin@@ kable .
in italy , this story played out for years .
men have four or five wives .
so , at the beginning , i spent ,
and while mrs. pav@@ aro@@ tti is in seclu@@ sion ,
but my wife suffered more .
he caught it-@@ in the neck for-@@ pav@@ aro@@ tti the pop star .
and now@@ -@@ falling in love ... ... he@@ -@@ cau@@ ght-@@ it in the neck again .
o@@ oh . guy must 've been a hunter .
did i hear you say that you thought that she looked like amber ?
like , just under six feet , blonde hair , kin@@ da top-@@ heavy .
yeah , and you think that shel@@ ly looks like her ?
yeah .
short with dark hair ,
uh , shel@@ ly .
we 're both seeing completely different versions of you .
the guy 's got white hair .
okay , i 'll tell you what ... if we can get you in touch with mar@@ coni
we got a direct line . here .
you dream@@ t you were being chased through the forest by your mother .
that 's right , ar@@ nie . everything you know is wrong
a lot worse .
we were just a year or two out of high school ,
i once knew a man
emergency room , john .
yeah . i don 't know what else to do . i 'm not gonna play this game with you .
he pulls out this sauce and goes ,
i mean that didn 't happen .
did anyone else take the sauce ?
i think they got fre@@ aked out when they saw a needle come out .
are you kidding me ? how could i not ?
okay , all right .
uh , hi . i need a priest .
what can i do for you ?
have any experience with , like .
no no no . no no . i 'm not crazy .
why don 't you come talk to me ?
well , they never know they 're ill , do they ?
i suppose you just feel regular
oh fuck !

look , i appreciate your time , but .
son , i 'm going to be honest with you .

congratulations . now who the fuck are you
it is said out of genuine concern for your safety .
kor@@ ro@@ k is a powerful adversary .
fascinating . what ?
do the bees know that they make the honey for you
do you ever wonder why sometimes you 'll see
black stu@@ ff@@ . this soy sauce .
oh , i 'll get to that .
it lets you read minds and all that .
i don 't know . it 's like .... . when you 're on it , it 's like overload .
and you 've still got some of this stuff ?
you 're on it right now .
yeah , i took some today .
it is physically impossible to avoid it .
ah ! shit
wait a minute .
what the fuck is that thing ?
it 's pretty fre@@ ak@@ y though , right ?
you made me see something
no , it 's really there .
most people only see it that fast if they 're st@@ oned or drunk .
i need to . i need to get it out .
the truth . okay .
okay .
anyway , so the cop comes in ,
he went into convul@@ sions or something . his pulse stopped .
we 've got vin@@ nie doing cpr on him .
now you listen to me , boy .
he can 't hurt me , right ?
dave , it 's me . where are you right now ?
the sauce .. i@@ u was alive
listen ,
i had a full 1.@@ 78 seconds before the detective would step through the door .
to that machine , one second is an eternity .
meaning ?
high school kid ?
i remember now . he 's that kid .. kin@@ da talks like a junior gang@@ ster .
well , he 's the guy@@ . who called in the ..
i thought he was stabbed in the gut or something
yeah , i guess .
ghost door .. you see it ?
all i see is a wall
now the tri@@ pper may not kill kor@@ ro@@ k ,
well , i like the concept , doctor .
just decide that you want to and you will .

the very day mr. ro@@ oney passed , it became senti@@ ent
for some , this process was easy .

i 'm only recently married .

oh , bern@@ ade@@ tte , you sound so old right now .
oh . i 'm sure he didn 't mean that .
oh , please , you 're just the right amount of bearing .

yeah , i do .
i hope we get to spend lots of time together .
bail@@ ey , you 're my mentor
okay , you have ...
we do it because when you say you want the truth ...
shepherd says his wife 's still unconscious , too .
so even if i cared , i wouldn 't trade .
i don 't know what that is .
what could either be pizza sauce or blood .
i was hoping it was blood , and you were dying
these interns are sl@@ oppy .
and i trained you ,
swa@@ g bags for the syrians .
dr. murphy is gonna run some labs
okay .
it doesn 't mean you 're gonna get it .
it 's entirely possible it means nothing at all .
i want you to call the lawyer .
even if you get the disease , it 's decades away .
we have a child
that 's not going to work .
okay . you 're right . i will contact the guy .
okay , we 're gonna try as closely as we can
uh , we , um , before had all of these things ,
please . we 're here to make this work for you .
this is more right .
now we go .

ross , you should be learning something else
also , i brought you a lat@@ te .
sorry . i 'm here . i had to get a piece of gum .
well , she will love him whatever his name is .
i know what she 'll say .
my talk was a viral sensation .
because of me .
a carti@@ lage regeneration lab
uh , me . i can do fracture repairs .
i got a blade i can use for skin gra@@ fting .
oh , check with ross .
wait . i thought brooks was on your service today .
he likes to follow through .
her flight got canceled ,
but this is pretty standard , right ?
it 's an unusually aggressive infection ,
you don 't want to cut too deep .
that 's good . but no deeper .
okay , so you want to place the screws
m@@ m-@@ hmm . now advance the screw by hand . yeah .
don 't be afraid to push too hard .
not when you don 't have anesthesia .
let 's go at this another way .
it 's okay .
and meanwhile , you 're sitting here .
my mom 's not coming here
i had a low-@@ grade fever .
so i came in .
okay .
i just can 't be a mom .
they already have a mom .
you 're not dying right now . you know that right ?
can you check out bed three ?
uh , no , not yet .
why didn 't you talk to me first ?
but you knew that i was concerned about this case .
it shouldn 't be news to you
sh@@ ane , you have to stop .
yeah , but she anno@@ ys you , doesn 't she ?
brooks has an instinct for this that you don 't have .
well , if i 'm making up for it , who cares how ?
you should find a specialty where you shine .
doesn 't that count for anything ?
and that means , to me , i have to teach her , not you .
go figure out where .
where are we going , sen@@ sei ?
just use peripheral vascular instruments
and then thread both ends
yes , but not for long , please .
oh , he 'll be fine with social services .
this kid doesn 't have to .
yeah , but we 're human for a reason .
and maybe he believes it 's true , but i think ,
bank has a house
you pay the bank , don 't pay your taxes ,
well , congratulations .
talk about what you want to .
not this one . another one .

my ability to do things , to be things .

here 's some information about hiv and ads you may find informative .
mr. vo@@ od@@ roof
based on your health .
to put your affairs in order .
i 'm sorry .
you should try it .
shit , i 'd take disability any day .
hell , like i got the aids .
shit you know , i went to them doctors one time
you tell ' em you got fucking headache , they tell you you got brain cancer
we believe those problems were dosage based .
actually the fda has given us permission to go straight to human trials
dallas mercy is one of the proposed sites .
during which the hospital and physicians will be compensated for efforts
a chance to be on the forefront in finding a cure .
what do they know about patients ? they 're a big re@@ ps , not doctors
people are desperate . you know , people are dying
need to see dr. se@@ v@@ ard
you wanna know the list of my problems ?
well .. how can i help you ?
no . i 'm a fucking doctor
i know the av@@ ine@@ x industries ,
that isn 't how it works .

i can go a month
but , when it 's proven to work and ...
so , you 're telling me i 'm as good as a horse

yeah .

i still live here , you hear me ?

yeah ? you won 't find that shit here
this place is a sh@@ it-@@ hole , doc .
they revoked my license to practice three years ago ,
breaking down your immune system
no , i 'm saying , cocaine made you more susceptible .
i thought az@@ t 's supposed to help me .
it kills every cell it comes in contact with .
as well as the mineral zinc to build your immune system .
sounds fun ?
where were you ?
bless your little heart .
i promise you , that i will try my very best .
okay .
swear to god
well

ye@@ p .
you don 't deserve our money
god@@ damn it .
10@@ j 's of customers here , dar@@ lin@@ '

i know , i know . it 's been too long
in the entire universe . oh , my god !

tf i can 't trust you , it is my business .
ah@@ h , mr. wood@@ roof
so , we need to know where you acquired the drugs .
i say what goes in my body , not you .
you think i 'm one of your god@@ damn guinea pigs , se@@ v@@ ard ?
mr. wood@@ roof
well , hear this .
why are my fucking walls painted red ?
people can live with this thing for longer than they 're saying
if you 're abusing it , like you did
why is boy george 's mu@@ g all over my fuc@@ kin ' room ?
get out , both of you .
oh , come on . i 'm not finished yet .
we need you to fill up this form .
we need your address , phone number , your complete medical history .
den@@ ise !
she got full blown aids .
here i 'm gonna need your complete medical history .
no , off the candy
who do you think is gonna do that when i 'm not here ?
god sure was dressing the wrong doll
look , it 's one thing for me not to like you
you don 't believe that i would actually ...
that snake you work for . that 's my prime candidate .
as a matter fact , if you hear of anything in his office
and , what is going on ?
non toxic drug , that i got proof it works .
says it 's completely safe .
we have to pay for them .
god .
the pain persisted , so he took another ...
unfortunately , when mike 's pain began to sub@@ side ,
but mike never shared this with those who cared about him ,
i 'm out . i need to meet you tomorrow .
it 's not like he 's trying to put a ring on my finger .
aw , he 's so beautiful when he slee@@ ps .
he 's fine , but i 've been doing so reading ,
isn 't it designed to facilitate breast-@@ feeding ? :
you 're not lac@@ t@@ ating .
well , that doesn 't make caring for an infant any less ti@@ ring .
i suppose .
she 's broke and old and rude .
stell@@ a is very resource@@ ful .
okay , this is no time for nam@@ e-@@ calling .
well , don 't worry , ma 'am .
we 'll find out exactly what happened to your husband .
mom , want to mall with derek back later j
all right . how was it ?
i doubt if the crown i put in will last her a year .
that 's not the point .
if we did , he mi@@ ght@@ n 't have turned out so ...
lazy ?
i was going to say angry ,
of course , that 's off the menu these days .
and if you 're as tired as you say you are ,
you 're leaving our bed ?
i 'll have a better shot at both if i 'm alone .
i don 't think so .
you should have told the truth about us .
adam , let me in .
oh , my god .
oh , well , good . at least she 's not living like a ho@@ bo .
know it 's a little dic@@ ey , but you 'd really be doing me a big favor .
i haven 't seen her since i delivered dani@@ elle 's baby .
hey , andrew .
is this about the other morning ?
i am . in fact , i already gave the landlord a check .
yeah , he said that you owed him money for some ..
yeah .
he 's coming back tomorrow .
well , it 's about the mayor .
i think he 's dead .
carlos please .
now they know someone else was with him on the boat .
it 's just a matter of time .
you okay with te@@ qu@@ ila ?
oh , i think you 'll find this has a real kick .
i thought i told you to stay away from my house .
and , hey@@ you married into a cute famil@@ y.@@ ku@@ dos .
now get out .
i 'm taking julie on a tour of my campus .
you son of a bit@@ ch@@ .you set me up .
now where do you think you 're going ?
i failed as a woman .
i don 't think that 's how it works .
so ashamed .
uh , sor@@ ry@@ .i didn 't mean to e@@ av@@ es@@ drop , but , um ...
you know , he 's always talked like that .
i 'm sor@@ ry@@ .you want this around ?
and for the next few years , she would be known as
a mysterious cas@@ sette tape had ben discovered by my friend bre .
oh , no , she 's not .
you better get over there . she 's wearing cotton .
what 's that ?
i held onto it in case of an emergency .
but if you want to give it a shot , be my guest .
oh , which one goes and which one stays ?
you want to talk about good neighbor etiquette ?
i am on a fixed income .
run by germans , hm ?
you 're going to the hospital , mrs. mc@@ cl@@ us@@ key .
i don 't wanna go alone . come with me .
and i 've got a roast in the ... free@@ zer .
all that time i was looking for her .
i 'm so sorry .
i wanna tell you what my doctor said .
see , i had this skin tag ,
please , i can 't sleep in the den anymore .
you might wanna try a mo@@ tel ,
obviously a few more .
i admit , i was way out of line .
you know what to do .
well , then have fun at the mo@@ tel .
what ?
what am i supposed to do for money ?
i 'm unhappy . with carlos and my marriage ..
every time something went south in my life ,
oh , um ... now 's not a good time .
that 's great , because my car 's on the frit@@ z
i know you 're trying to get over mor@@ ty
you know how blue i 've been . why can 't you be supportive ?
you haven 't . you really haven 't .
if he 's not gone in five minutes ,
del@@ fin@@ o .
your mother tells me
no . i 'm gonna need every drop .
aren 't they gorgeous ?
sorry .
sh@@ h ! talk later , you 're watching the game .
you have no money , what 's the story :
i also forgot i have options . a whole bunch of ' em .
i don 't need your credit cards . carlos .
but if our marriage is going to work ,
open these , would you , and put out the pills ?
god knows what your kids pick up .
she said she doesn 't think i 'm going to heaven .
i 'm sure she didn 't mean to hurt your feelings .
when she said that to me .
i 've been called worse .
you know what , ky@@ le ?
it won 't be right away
look at you .
everybody who meets me wants to be my friend .
what kin@@ da name is sw@@ in anyway ?
if we go 83 the rest of the way we won 't be late .
if you decide to run off ,
do not bring girls around
why , just think . one day this could all be yours .
vacu@@ um@@ in ' his cor@@ ve@@ tte .
would either of you boys like to call me sir ?
we 're gonna go traffic drugs across state lines , sir !
how many of those you got anyway , like , ten ?
sounds like a stri@@ pper recipe to me .
one of ' em 's already named cin@@ nam@@ on .
that 's why you 're so good at this shit . your brain 's managing
in whose car ?
do i look like a drug dealer to ya ?
testament gave me a suit .
i miss him to much .
i am so sorry to hear that , but you know what ?
that shit you sold him was bun@@ k .
it 's boring . you don 't w@@ ann@@ a. you don 't even wanna ..
put it in the dr@@ yer with the rest .
probably already counted it as just lost .
uh , maybe only that something 's not right .
it 's impossible to tell right now and that 's the truth .
he won 't even tell me where his family lives .
okay .
how bad is it
i didn 't
like wholesale .
and park ran@@ ger bright , he was our boss .
we didn 't know what to do or who to tell , so
as soon as we found the bodies .
these trailers are pieces of shit .
we need to go shopping this weekend .
we need to get a stro@@ ller , cri@@ b , that kin@@ da thing
you ain 't gonna say hi
hey , barry . is your daddy still dead ?
barry , i think it 'd be best if we made you
why would i bother myself tr@@ yin ' to figure all this out anyway , you know ?
every time i come over here ...
how about you ? you know where mr. bright is ?
look at me , look at me , look at me , look at me .
you 're okay . you 're okay . you 're okay .
you 're one of us now
go on . all right , ready ?
we 're full in our rights to use it .
and then some .
our aunt don 't really care what we do all day .
how do you like being mechanics ?
well , it happens , i 'm in the black market game .
so what do you say ?
what 's the title ?
senior distribution executive
you may never refuse an order and you may never quit .
i will hunt ya down and i 'll kill ya , no matter how much i 've grown to like ya .
tim , you 'll no longer wear that ear@@ ring .
well , gang ban@@ gers are taking more streets day by day .
but what do you think , frog ?
it 's your business now . you do what you want with it .
maybe you took too many hits to the head .
i don 't want it to be like that with us .
you boys are ready .
i 'll open up a little cu@@ rio shop .
we wanna have as much good debt as possible
i intend to kill you by strang@@ ulation .
why not just shoot me ?
what , do you roll the ball around in a circle 500 times
it was gonna be a star and a moon ,
excuse me .
my feet are like sa@@ usages .
but you are going to get a crash course education
the only thing that matters is the evidence .
what is he talking about ?
and the evidence in this case will focus on
we will establish that dr. torres made a series
implant 's in place . everything looks good .
all right , let 's start closing . irrigation , please .
we 're missing one sponge .
we can 't close until we find it .
all right , you know , it 's gotta be on someone 's shoe
no , that 'll take too long . he could go into shock .
oh , cra@@ p , cra@@ p , cra@@ p , cra@@ p , cra@@ p , cra@@ p .
no , there 's no time .
you can 't do that !
we still haven 't
i had to force him to come in .
i 've seen worse .
yeah .
a small one . tra@@ vis ,
oh , wow ? what does " oh , wow " mean ?
the wound looks a little infected .
yeah . okay .
we can 't afford any delays .
all right , if she 's not available in the next five minutes ,
no , there 's no way to salvage the joint .
and just .. leave him with no hip ?
it 's the only way to get this completely cleaned out .
oh , yeah . it 's the best .
and the pe@@ eing .
oh , and then the .. the no boo@@ ze .
it 's never nothing .
my lawyer 's on speed dial , for crying out loud .
you really didn 't have to come all this way .
my baby 's in trouble .
oh , all right . well , i don 't understand .
we split up . she cheated on me . it 's been bad .
when did this happen ?
why didn 't you tell me ?
i-i fought so hard just to get you to accept us .
cris@@ tina
will you tell cal@@ lie to back off and let me do my job ?
he can 't live without a functioning heart .
he 'll be more stable , and the heart surgery will be less risky .
let me try to save his leg .
oh , he was fe@@ br@@ ile overnight but his white count 's stable .
tra@@ vis ?
what 's wrong ?
are we losing this case ?
we haven 't presented our side .
richard ! well , you shouldn 't be here .
it 's a miracle i made it here at all .
i even spoke with the team who invented it .
and the surgery ? it went smoothly ?
what wasn 't perfect ?
and that 's when you left the sponge .
and i would do it again .
i-i believe that the sponge wouldn 't compromise the joint .
it was the right call .
not a mistake .
you wanted to work on tra@@ vis 's leg .
why ?
which is an indication that the limb is starting to die .
once a limb turns black , there 's nothing we can do .
and she knew that the heart would keep throwing out clo@@ ts
okay , let 's say you 're cooking ,
what do you do ?
or do you extingu@@ ish the curtains ?
i cannot believe you 're picking this fight right now !
i am trying to tell you how i feel .
okay ? it wasn 't just your kid .
wanna do it ? i bet they 'll let us tem@@ p together .
oh , god . last week ,

i , uh , bet you wouldn 't mind if i broke my neck on that sco@@ o@@ ter now .
aunt lily just took a pill , so she 's down for the afternoon .
this is what i wanted .
i pretended to so she 'd leave us alone .
then why did he always avoid you ?
because of you !
again , karen , we are so sorry .
you can let me go , all right ? i 'm okay .
i didn 't break in . i ...
went in the wrong house .
i just ... i just had a little too much fun last night .
thanks to me , you have a genetic pre@@ disposition to alcoholism .
i can be pretty resource@@ ful .
hey . i saw the party rental truck . what 's going on ?
w@@ h ... our spring fling ? we 're .. still fl@@ inging ?
oh , i don 't know . unless the theme is
well , we can 't ignore the fact
they told me there was no chance ...
beth is alive , and i intend to keep her that way
beth was not in her right mind when she signed those forms .
and who 's the client ?
coffee ? dou@@ gh@@ nuts ?
this is an a.@@ a. meeting .
lying to your son .. which step is that ?
my chief financial officer took a job in london ,
glen@@ n , where 'd this come from ?
so i started asking around . come to find out everybody loves you .
i 'm prepared to give you a very generous salary ,
but no .
what ?
look , tom , i don 't want to buy a man out of his loyalty ...
ly@@ net@@ te ... glen@@ n@@ you have made my day , but i gotta pass .
i 'm not gonna screw over carlos .
nothing .
ly@@ net@@ te , as much as i appreciate you trying to run my life ,
anyone else want to share ?
when i hear you guys talk
you know , i ... i think her greatest regret in life
i mean ...
nothing i ever did was good enough for her .
you 're not exactly a born leader . "
well , maybe she was busy
uh , b@@ ree ?
well , there is a difference between sharing and wh@@ ining .
god ...
so i just want to remind you about the pan@@ ty rene@@ e and i are throwing tomorrow night .
so .. rene@@ e and i are still having our party ...
beth young .
making me the compassionate one .
yeah , he was exhausted .
and now she 's gone .
maybe she can recover .
i 'm not praying for her .
we did this to her , paul .
and we have to let her rest .
sure .
look , the deal was one meeting , mom . i went and i 'm done .
n@@ ope . el@@ vis has left the building .
i hope you know that " i don 't have a problem "
i ... i have no job .
doing a little better here .
you are a valuable part of this company .
oh , that 's great .
and you are walking away from real money and real power
told ya . well , i 'm pretty close to capacity ,
wait . is that the guy from animal control
uh , these are mostly people i 've met through the years
is it okay if i clean your pool
u@@ gh ! don 't give me that look .
honey , the only mix i see
you have a cool house .
well , i 'm not sad , and i 'm not gonna pretend to be .
and whose fault is that ?
i can 't tell if we are gonna drive ...
what time does this have to be back ?
i 'm gu@@ essing we could be a little late .
hello , susan .
as you know , our decision to for@@ go direct as@@ cent
well , even considering von bra@@ un 's initial criticism ,
dave scott is gonna be your pilot .
don 't worry about elli@@ ot .
o@@ ams propellant , 13 % .
gemin@@ i 8 , coming back into range in three , two , one .
how do you read ?
we have serious problems .
we 're dis@@ engaged from the ag@@ ena .
what seems to be the problem ?
yeah .
we did everything , as far as i know .
we saw f@@ lawless ren@@ de@@ z@@ v@@ ous and doc@@ king .
how near were you to being unconscious ?
we did .
as i said , we initially assumed
i 'm done .
jimmy asked what you 're gonna say
uh ... a lot of things have to go right
um .... well , we launch in ten days ,
we 'll be in isolation .
and i know how much you love single mal@@ t sco@@ tch .
oh , god , no , i bought it for you .
i 'm trying to finish this book i started a long time ago .
about he@@ ide@@ gger and fascism .
another book about he@@ ide@@ gger and fascism .
'm blocked . i can 't write
i can 't write ' cause i can 't breathe .
i , you know .. the will to breathe .
inspiration , you know ?
i 'm sorry about this afternoon .
and you took the ci@@ alis ?
can i confess something ?
i deliver them to him , they don 't want to go .
he sticks ' em in a corner of the garage he works at .
i mean , they should be outside , in the fresh air .
on what grounds ? :
switching custody would be a disaster .
i brought in the kids ' teachers , i brought in the kids ' doctors .
and you 're sure he can 't be rec@@ used ?
it 'm due in court in six weeks .
i can 't get a decent night 's sleep .
i mean , i actually thought of taking them out of the country .
you 'd be a fugitive .
he won 't get cancer .
if you want him dead , you have to make it happen .
on the other hand , i could kill him for you , lady ,
i could perform this blessing for that poor woman
what , you 're shaking
an anxiety attack or something .
okay .
everything about killing judge sp@@ ang@@ ler turned me on .
i was intri@@ gued by the creative challenge of bringing off a perfect murder .
no one can stop him .
it 's not that ambiguous , even though it 's ugly to say it .
the di@@ zz@@ iness and anxiety had disappeared ,
my mind was racing with ideas , plans to kill judge sp@@ ang@@ ler .
i knew you 'd love that lighthouse .
oh , it 's so beautiful here .
not to have to rely on single mal@@ t sco@@ tch .
what you are is in love with the romantic concept
is that really what you think ?
and even your poet laureate .
my god , what have you been eating for breakfast ?
what happened to the philosophy professor ?
for the first time in so long , i felt free .
run away with me .
my z@@ est for life had returned
one day a week , he played bridge with his c@@ ron@@ ies at the pavilion club .
saturday mor@@ nings , he jo@@ gged at li@@ pp@@ it@@ t park .
why continental philosophy ?
where 's roy tonight ?
and now that we 're here , i 'm determined to win you a prize .
his spirits seemed up ,
i want to go with my first instinct . there 's my first hun@@ ch , 17 .
no , it 's a bad idea . it 's a bad idea .
you have a terrific boyfriend
come on , let 's have fun .
but maybe it was just that he wasn 't in love with me
all i was sure of was that as much as i cared for roy ,
i was right in thinking the killing would be an act of creativity .
weighing all the options , i came to the conclusion
cyan@@ ide would be quick and pain@@ less .
every stage of the way was a risk and i must admit , ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating
yeah .
well , that 's cool .
yes , i know .
sure , sure , but can we talk as we walk ?
i don 't understand . you 've been in such a tou@@ chy mood .
yeah , but the only reason i got the tickets
roy and i aren 't exclusive , i told you that .
roy would say different .
well , god , i 'm sure , but we were celebrating .
well , who do you think it was ? do you think it was the woman ?
or , one of her friends or something ?
i feel like an authentic human being .
that life has the meaning you choose to give it .
it was as if whatever had been sti@@ fling his deepest feelings became un@@ blocked .
at a press conference ,
you 're wearing a new perfume .
what ?
today for one very funny moment ,
don 't know , i con 't know .
it 's got to be hard to kill somebody .
especially to poison a stranger .
i mean , cyan@@ ide 's a whole other deal .
i always assume anyone poisoned , is poisoned by cyan@@ ide .
i mean , someone would have to be close enough to him
i enjoyed the whole conversation .
oh , that 's a good point .
someone appears out of the blue , and drops something in his drink ?
or someone could have gone to pas@@ cal 's and gotten a juice ,
right .
and he was right . i wasn 't . but i didn 't know what to do anymore .
oh , yes , are you gonna tell me that she had an affair with him ?
no , she has this hil@@ arious theory about abe lucas .
she thinks he would be a good suspect in that case of the murdered judge .
oh , please .
once i was inside abe 's house , i felt i was betra@@ ying him .
i couldn 't imagine what i expected to find .
oh , are you kidding ?
not fl@@ ab@@ ber@@ ga@@ sted .
i played out my last few weeks at bra@@ yl@@ in
i knew j@@ ill would never betra@@ y me .
well , there goes my theory . i guess i ' never work for the t@@ bi
i don 't know
look , it 's none of my business ,
and it 's not like he 's some great cycl@@ ist or something .
how much is it worth ?
and that ticket is as good as cash .
maybe i take a little finder 's fee , let 's just say a third .
what ? ls mr lin in charge ?
let me tell ya something , boys . i am a cop !
hey . come on , it wasn 't that bad .

i 'm gonna go get my morphine . i 'll be right back .
i 'll take care of myself .
what 's going on ?
n@@ ima .

it 's hard enough out there .
i gave it back to the front desk .
who told them to change the address ?
you get your envelope back ?
but it 's going to the wrong place .
what do you care ?
it 's like a receipt for a great deal of money .
a man or a woman ? that would be a dude .
i gave it to man@@ ny .

we could reverse his pain me@@ ds ,
chief , i 'm getting all sorts of conflicting reports
i don 't know if there 's a second shooter ,
they 're intact .
abdominal bleeding is under control for now .
well , i can put in a traction pin to stabilize the fem@@ ur .

are you much acquainted with him ?
ie 's been here for less than a month
i have been connected with his family from infancy .
darcy and i grew up together .
i had my heart set on joining the church .
what could have induced him to behave so cruel@@ ly ?
i loved his father de@@ arly , so , i can never expose darcy
we must plan our trip to the north country .
well , perhaps i shall see you at mr. bing@@ ley 's ball ?
i feared that mr. darcy 's presence would keep you away .
i have found you , miss ben@@ net !
wick@@ ham .
i do hope you haven 't forgotten our dance ?
oh , allow me .
lady catherine herself has praised me on my ligh@@ tness of foot .
well , rich .
and j@@ hen .
would 've ruined the ball for anyone who witnessed it .
did you happen to see four gentlemen pass this way ?
you saw them ?
the crown 's funds have been drained
these new zom@@ bies can be reasoned with .
oh , yeah .
the common h@@ ord@@ es look to them for leadership .
the un@@ dead are like loc@@ u@@ sts .
they go forth and destroy . they have no use for leaders .
oh , well , um , according to the book of revelation , actually ,
this is your opinion of me ?
you could not have made the offer of your hand
you 've said quite enough , madam .
" as to your other accusation , of having injured mr. wick@@ ham ,
" wick@@ ham squ@@ an@@ dered it .
" thereafter he severed all ties with me .
" for i have suffered a mortal wound .
" i cannot fix the hour or the spot
" what a proud fool i was .
" i write to you from the siege of london .
" i sense a dark hand is at work here ,

i don 't do switches .
fine . i can accept that .
you get to be with me on breast cancer .
she 's pregnant .
the guy 's films are clear .

where 'd you grow up ?
where d you spend your summer vac@@ ations ?
oh , don 't you tell me to ligh@@ ten up .
don 't we have treatment options ?
with this stage of invasive carcinoma ,
the pregnancy hormones will likely speed the growth of the cancer .
none of these treatments will allow the baby to survive .
they are not .
dr. small and angry was a hot appe@@ tiz@@ er ,

so i think , at this point , chairman , you know ,
i 'm gonna have to kill a senator .
he ...
he didn 't tell us he was gonna do that .
they 'll never be allowed in the plant again .
all of our workers are members of the workers union .

something 's wrong with that .
that could 've been me . what if i got sick ?
the man i was working with ,
dayton taxpayers and the state of ohio have committed
working people and the labor movement built america .

these two things can exist together .

that 's why i 've decided to spare you .
a chance that lucia and my mother never had .
good .
d@@ asha ?
she 's just sleeping .
why is she ..
to make a difference for you ...
i offered to pay the board millions ,

why hasn 't stephen haw@@ king played a word ?
maybe you weren 't challenging enough for him .
i was humiliating the man
you can 't beat haw@@ king like that .
everyone knows the guy 's a big baby .
really ?
i told him he was wrong , but he kept insisting .
well , the next day , he had a pizza party ,
terrible .
co@@ op and rolling thunder are together again .
so , now all you have to do is let him win .

he is in charge of the guard unit . this is captain her@@ old .
we 're forever waiting for the stand court . he 's not from the stand court .
all i heard was special ops , and i thought it was time to get serious .

yes . thats why i told captain her@@ old about our storage problem .
yes , you know .. with all the escaped prisoners
we 're struggling with the same problems .
well , how do we know each other , oh so .

i 've got a pretty good instinct for that .
what do you think , ger@@ da , huh ?
hm .. maybe a murderer ?
i am not a murderer at all . what are you then ?
sadly , yes .
it 's for one of her colleagues who is of asian descent ,
what can i say ?
amy .
i 'm not allowed to wear my silver sur@@ fer neck tie ,

for as many dol@@ ls as we want .
at any point , did it dawn on you to talk to me
i don 't believe you !
what are you talking about ?
you make pean@@ uts !
that means , when you get sick ,
you 're gonna return the machine .
oh , my god ! are you actually thinking about it ?
why didn 't you just tell kri@@ p@@ ke the truth ?
anyway , if kri@@ p@@ ke asks ,
why ?
he can protect me like my friends .
he protects me from the creatures that crawl in the night .

i thought that , too .
you know ,
oh , sorry . am i interrup@@ ting ?

it 's just such a fascinating story .
it 's like mis@@ reading a treasure map
and in chemistry , no less .
because you 're a physicist .
everyone laugh at the circus fre@@ ak .
people love trained monkeys .
you 're tall , thin and famous .
look , you 're gonna be doing this stuff for a while .
but none of you know what this is like .

and you swear that you 're not in love with anyone named mike ?
okay . come here . i believe you .
my wallet had been stolen . i was lying in a pool of my own vom@@ it .
nobody 's buying a baby here . that 's illegal .
lib@@ by , you 'll make a list of your expenses , and the sol@@ ises here will pay .
i knew this one girl who gave up her baby , and she got a har@@ ley .
okay . whatever .
till i get rid of this kid , they got me sl@@ inging drinks .
sorry . so what kind of name is that ?
both our families come from guadal@@ aj@@ ara .
n@@ ope . latin@@ o . proud of it .
yeah . my little girl 's gonna inherit some wonderful genes .
yes , it 's all natural , from her straight teeth to her " c " cup .
no , the athletic gene , not the pole dancing gene .
oh , i got your call , uh .. i thought i 'd stop by .
um , we 'll just be a second .
be right back . just be a second .
let 's just move on to the next one .
i want that woman 's baby .
penny ...
girls , you remember miss ham ? grand@@ daddy 's secretary ?
oh , my , you two have grown .
hol@@ lis said you found her .
i don 't have an exclusive deal here .
so if you arranged a deal
someone who knows enough law to know she 's right .
i have a contract , and i 'll sue you .
where does bull han@@ cock eat lunch ?
but it 's gentlemen only .
i 'm sorry , mr. han@@ cock .
it 's all right , bren@@ da . it 's all right .
well , how 's it going ?
do tell .
the farm 's in bad shape , as is daddy .
well , horse farm needs a strong hand on the re@@ ins ,
i need a good trainer just to get things stabilized .
what do you mean , " trying " ?
excuse me . i 'm penny ch@@ ener@@ y , chris ch@@ ener@@ y 's daughter .
yeah , bull called me , but i tell you ,
well , i 'm in a bit of a tight spot .
we have plenty of good horses .
well , that 's why i 've come to see you , mr. la@@ ur@@ in .
you 're going to have to go back to bull and see if he has any other ideas .
fore ! hey !
watch where you 're hitting !
penny ? penny ! do you know what that means ?
what is this ? come on . we need you here , penny .
right after the coin toss .
hol@@ lis . what are you doing here ?
how do you expect we can fetch a good price on the farm
this coin toss is big . the fo@@ al could be worth a great deal .
they think he wants hasty mati@@ l@@ da 's fo@@ al .
no , hol@@ lis , i think that 's wrong .
world . you know more than they do ?
please don 't take offense , miss ch@@ ener@@ y ,
all right . we 're all here now .
the winner has the choice of the offspring of mr. ch@@ ener@@ y 's ma@@ res .
are we all in agreement here ? all right . here we go .
but i got what i wanted .
can i give you a lift home ?
phi@@ p@@ ps . he went with hasty mati@@ l@@ da .
call me when she 's ready to drop her fo@@ al .
we 've been putting on this protest page@@ ant for a year .
what do you mean you can 't ?
when the teacher saw what we were doing .. dad , can we , like , sue them ?
what ?
she sca@@ res me .
secretariat leaning against the back of@@ the gate .
it wasn 't exactly what i had in mind .
he was ready to race . he just wasn 't ready to play bum@@ per cars .
so do i. what were you doing ?
go on home . just go on .
excuse me ? what are you saying ?
are you sure that it was paul 's fault , then ?
no . it was my fault .
well , i know this .
you want a j@@ ockey who won 't back off , then you want ron@@ nie tur@@ co@@ tte .
know a lot more about it than i do .
every bit of this is my business ! do you understand ?
i called to check on your flight .
you 'd be able to ride in our next race .
i spoke with some of the owners you ride for .
you 're great with young horses .
use bad judgment . put a horse into too much traffic where he can 't run .
i hear you have the heart of a champion . i know my horse does .
i 'm sorry ?
what did luci@@ en say ?
i want to win , just like they do .
but it 's who they are . and it 's who i am .
i don 't want somebody else .
his name is secretariat .
you don 't know which horses we own .
big red one .
y@@ up .
close them up !
conditions are perfect . the track is rated very fast .
the field is spreading out . rus@@ s mir@@ on out quickly .
he 's got nowhere to move . i thought you said tur@@ co@@ tte was aggressive .
secretariat . secretariat making a bold move .
i 'm not selling him .
but if he were to lose just one of the triple crown races
him and og@@ den phi@@ p@@ ps knew all that
and he 's got a horse named missed opportunity .
and they 're going to insist on a performance clause .
that 's a mil@@ e-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half distance
this is a big deal . i have never done anything like this before .
you mind if i ask why you called me ?
your father , he really helped me and ...
i 'm in .
ladies and gentlemen , start your engines !
no , sir , he 's not for sale .
it 's a select opportunity . we have 32 shares ...
i will head that way . i 'll see you in a bit . all right , b@@ ye@@ -@@ bye .
nobody has .
we will call him back later . thank you .
no dis@@ respect , sir , but if he gets any better ,
you could have her give me a call me later this afternoon .
or@@ son ! not on the du@@ vet ! oh , it 's okay .
mistress ' teeth in it ! let 's just take them to the police .
we can 't prove these came from alma 's .
and don 't forget , i 'm the one they suspect .
i agree , but not until we put the back in her house .
that 's how he could tell when people were lying through them .
in the moment it takes a gun@@ man 's bullet to enter his victim 's leg ..
in the instant it takes a father to meet his son for the very first time ..
yes , and she hasn 't responded to any of the me@@ ds that we 've tried .
uh , not just yet .
it worked for her before .
this is your new lawyer , alan marcus .
hey , mike .
i was wrapping up an armed robbery trial .
so should we get started ?
i 've got a strategy to ensure your case never goes to trial .
what 's the strategy ?
he 'd only be ple@@ ading to man@@ slaughter .
well which is better than life , and that 's what mike 's risking if he goes to trial .
with a better lawyer , he could be out in zero .
well , the evidence against him is very compelling .
my " feelings for him " ?
je@@ ez .
a little bit of both .
your father 's taught you well .
what 'd you do with mon@@ ique 's teeth ?
maybe i hid them here .
oh , l don 't think you 'll bring the police into this .
we 're done .
you shouldn 't treat me this way .
tears might 've worked when we were married , after you lost the baby .
we should have kept trying .
oh ! cra@@ p , that 's ed .
ly@@ net@@ te , please ?
my boss is waiting for me outside in his car .
it 's time to get creative .
anything we can do ?
dirty ! see ya next week ! thanks for understanding !
never mind .
what 's eating you ?
what ?
he has been begging ga@@ by to go on a date with him .
z@@ ach young ?
how does he afford diamonds ?
yeah , thought it was in a trust , and he couldn 't touch it .
it 's corn@@ meal . that 's the secret .
uh , hi , ed .
i know ! you 're such a good dancer !
i 've been taking lessons ' cause i knew it was your favorite .
" cosm@@ o , " ' 98 .
you researched me ? that 's sweet !
but gossip was the foundation of our relationship , so ..
ian was traveling a lot on business ,
so i guess they worked it out , right ?
but if you 're asking , did he ever really trust her again ? i don 't think so .
you play that pretty well .
i had a good time tonight , but ..
yeah , me too .
forget about it .
it 's not just them . i ...
you think just ' cause we 're two girls
you do that ? do you have a card ?
you ? she changed the menu again .
so what are we gonna do now ?
max , we can 't go .
we also need a shower curtain that doesn 't give us r@@ ashes .
we also really need a toilet
and we owe uncle sam $ 1,500 .
so what are we gonna do ?
well , it could have been alo@@ t worse
nick@@ y. can you hear me ?
it 's temporary . so is the nausea .
i think i pop@@ ped a couple stit@@ ches .
what ?
peri@@ plan@@ eta americ@@ ana .
yeah , they were all over the van ...
i think they were attracted
and if he 'd stayed in prison where he belongs
on the ground and in the air .
catch up with you later .
you 've already been a hero today .
i can 't hear you .
not so fast .
you know that was my best suit .
investigators are comb@@ ing through the debris ,
bomb was designed to maximize chaos .... injuries .
that looks like brain matter .
i haven 't seen one of these since iraq .
not usually .
which means , there 's possibly three deton@@ ators .
g@@ c@@ ms identified residue
you can buy it at any gun store .
low explosive . why ?
the van bomb 's a different story .
that sounds like nate has@@ k@@ ell .
yeah , he gets off on the intimacy
are you saying it wasn 't nate has@@ k@@ ell ?
then who the hell is it ?
it 's crime driving without a license .
he 's a decent man .
and now the government took him away from us .
because ralph dared to live as a new american .
oh , a cell phone from their center detonated the bomb ,
well , i don 't know ... c@@ si 's working on it .
could be a younger brother .
well , the owner of hank 's hobby shop
he 's not gonna talk to you .
we know how well that turned out , right ?
in case you haven 't noticed , it 's already blown .
what are you gonna do , nick ,
i mean , i owe him that much , don 't you think ?
you off work or something ?
truck . cabin . spoon .
uh , what did you do for thanksgiving last year ?
what ? why ? is that wrong ?
no . i was with you and gav@@ in in london .
that was three years ago , mom ,
he broke up with me . we 're not getting back together .
okay , starting at 100 , count backwards by 7 .
dr. bail@@ ey said she was prepared to roll the dice ,
and if she can do that , she can do anything .
rob@@ bins has her baby shower , so i 'm free .
dude
we 're gonna have to run some tests to find out .
hey , it 's not like i went out for a chees@@ e@@ burger .
look , i still don 't have approval from the fda , bail@@ ey .
if we could just make them first on the list
a@@ very , just because a patient called you a stupid kid
grey ?
i 've been bon@@ ing up .
oh , bite me , mark .
are you guys fighting again ?
oh , yeah . of course . it 's not a real shower
no , you can 't . because if you quit and move here ,
please stop calling . good-@@ bye .
damn it . he 's got a mass . it 's close to his heart .
you ?
let alone allow you to operate on him .
it 's an extremely delicate surgery .
it 's win-win .
she 's a traditional girl , catholic .
that 's why i figured , the bigger shower , the better .
excuse me ?
every woman who 's ever had a pregnant friend hates them .
the bri@@ des@@ ma@@ ids always want to str@@ angle the bride .
the only one who 's not normal here is you for acting like
uh , i 'm fine . i 'm fine over here . thanks .
come on . it 'll be fun .
i 'm going .
mr. green , there 's no time to wait .
yeah , of course . you do whatever you need to do .
and then what ?
look , i just did a surgery that i wasn 't approved to do .
the patient would 've died .
you have alzheimer 's , honey .
please take the test , baby .
fine .
thank you .
that way ...
we 're going to grow old together
oh , someone threw out the gift list ,
what 's going on ?
yes , mark . i lost the list .
you 're a better woman than i am .
it 's okay . it 's not a big deal .
she lost the gift list , not me .
so .. there is one more gift left to open .
you got me a shower .
thank you , dr. kare@@ v . now go away .
i didn 't mean to call you that .
no , no , no . it was completely un@@ professional .
no organ damage . it 's working , chief .
well , good , ' cause i just talked to the fda .
i just heard the waiver came through .
yeah .
be at my place in 15 .
you hungry ? i got , uh , crab cakes ,
besides me , who 's in charge here ?
this is nick sto@@ kes .
you 're sam 's little girl , right ?
just like your old man .
you should discuss this some@@ place else .
mr. boo@@ z@@ ell ,
i wouldn 't even let the sheriff past that tape ,
sam 's little girl .
the " boo@@ ze " ?
let me guess .
yeah , so , uh , what now ?
i like murder better .
nick , help me out here .
i 'm not the one that got you in this mess .
a young woman was killed .
to a shark ?
she 's going to ble@@ ed out into the pool , period .
which could only mean she was dead
what happens ?
why ? because the artery 's like a pipe :
our victim did not die of a shark attack .
not on the front .
all ready .
oh , injection mark .
it would be impossible to inject yourself
catherine said coral .
according to shark week
that means the shark is only guilty of biting a dead woman .
dr. ray , it 's good to have you back .
i can 't help that she comes to me
seriously , you 're gonna blame me ?
henry .
and then you can 't take her home , ' cause you live at home .
that 's it !
what are you doing ?
i found the murder weapon .
you ever known shark skin to be smooth ?
it 's almost as if it was san@@ ded down .
gal@@ e@@ oc@@ er@@ do cu@@ vier .. gc .
are genus and species .
one zero means 2010 .
and there are only a handful
and i think i know who i 'm going to talk to first .
at least , it was your shark until it took a dip
" if there 's a shark missing from my property ,
i got rid of it .

you really understand my dilemma .
my mother is pushing for my brother ,
how are we gonna make these decisions
then we aren 't really making the decision ;
that decision only seems subjective .
if i may use a super@@ hero analogy ..
okay , i 'll use real people .
if a best man with fake testi@@ cles hanging
so we break down each of the roles
if i had known getting married was going to involve so much science ,
oh , oh , i 'm starting a book .
he means he 's writing a book .
yeah . it 's about a brilliant physicist
it 's not about you .
they gave us plain rice instead of fried rice .
the woman must contain all the attributes of fertility .
certain car@@ nal spots should be prominent ,
you chose intimate mode .
against my better judgments , activated nim@@ ani .
her behavior is not natural .
she does everything you want , but you don 't have to fight for it .
l don 't think you can have a relationship without any refusal , any struggle .
in one dimension , the cats alive .
the only way to find out ..
you never told me what she did to you .
it 's ..
this series of women without any soul .
bad outcome doesn 't mean that person was wrong .
come on , cut the cra@@ p .
this is perfectly customized advice just for you .
not as a part of sexual fantasy ,
ten , nine , eight , seven ,
i 'm okay . it hasn 't even been a year yet .
how are you getting along with nim@@ ani ?
it could be easier without her .
you said " we . "
operators fueled by personal frustration have proven to be solid employees
copy that .
are we still in the communication window ?
how come nim@@ ani 's supervising me ?
it runs on the latest ti@@ fa operating system .
wait a minute , you 're losing me here .
ls there any way to delete this cache memory of me ?
nd i can 't be an advanced user
some people feel nostal@@ gic for nasa 's free@@ z@@ e-@@ dried space foods .

i love you so much , and look at what you do to me .
computing initiated .
if you un@@ install the ti@@ fa software ,
l can just take this tablet , press the button ,

the ship is back on course .
why the fuck don 't you obey me , then ?
why the fuck do you care if i touch you ?
you are punishing me .
no . rape is a standard fantasy ..
you promised me she won 't hurt me .
but that 's impossible . she obe@@ ys all the asi@@ mo@@ v 's laws .
hat ?
just don 't play with my feelings .
it 's all pre@@ programmed .
she 's a person .
should seek professional help .
your engineers have data on everything .
but you 're not able to create life .
we all failed .
what do you want from me ?
why not ?
you 're a robot .
there isn 't a person in the world who knows you more intimately than i do .
i didn 't meant to hurt you .
you projected them all inside me
you risked your life to make me .
if i 'm so men@@ ac@@ ing , why don 't you shut me down ?
com@@ fir@@ med .
slipping into hi@@ ber@@ nation mode may ease the trauma ,

it 's bad , huh ?
the fact that we 're talking right now , leon ,
if these bars hadn 't caught me ,

kare@@ v , what the hell happened ?
make sure he doesn 't die .
this one 's sitting right next to the caro@@ tid ,
and according to the ultrasound ,
these bars are rough metal . when we take them out ,
doctors , he 's starting to lose his air@@ way .
that 'll take forever .
all right . just give me the grin@@ der , and you can go .
this is dangerous work , people . so everybody out .
and you 'll need me to irri@@ gate the metal .
that 's very good thinking .
no , grey , not you . you go .
she has a kid .
um , death , that 's pretty solid .
brooks .

now you 're supposed to be less stupid .
i don 't know . um , i need your help .
i found that on paul daw@@ son 's scan .

i 'm bored , but i mean , that 's only part of it .

it is scary .
yeah , i already read the brochure .
uh , no .
we 'll use the renal vein .
someone page dr. bail@@ ey , please .
why aren 't you doing a te@@ var ?
a te@@ var is safer . it 's far less invasive .
i already ordered the graft .
i might have nic@@ ked the caro@@ tid .
did you get the whole tumor ?
i 'm not asking for myself .
you don 't publish , you don 't teach ,
what do they call me ?
trust me , you two don 't want to be the next shepher@@ ds .
you had no business sho@@ ving in there .
i wasn 't about to let that guy die

she made a complete fool of me .
it 's all right . i 'm a doctor .
clear .
you know where i can find dr. shepherd ?
me@@ red@@ ith .
don 't come and clean up after her again .
and it 's beneath you , and it 's poin@@ tless .
i want my brain in an android body .
i 'm with you .
i promised my mother .
well , there 's always the possibility that a trash can
they want us to present our paper
okay , if i may drill down to the bedrock of my question
which , if i were there , it would be .
leonard , please don 't take this the wrong way ,
hey , leonard , your mama 's research methodology is so flawed ..
shel@@ don , we have to do this .
we have to take in nourishment , expel waste ,
okay , let me put it this way , i 'm doing it .
come on , the only reason you 're the lead author
not to put too fine a point on it ,
excuse me , i designed the experiment that proved the hypothesis .
so the entire scientific community
you forbid it ?
so you admit that it 's our work ? no .
and once again you are welcome .
are you guys still not talking to each other ?
you know , like in the classic sci@@ -fi movie scan@@ ners .
how about this one ?
wow , i didn 't know they still made cor@@ du@@ roy suits .
okay , well , let 's just see
and this , and this , and these ..
no , this is stuff i want you to throw out .
you won 't be helping anyone .
anyway . i was talking to leonard this morning ,
i don 't understand the question .
oh , i hadn 't thought about it like that .
wait@@ . what ?
just talk to him .
it 's certainly preferable to my plan .
a powerful lax@@ ative .
look , i know leonard values you as a friend ,
yeah , i mean , he tried to explain it to me .
it 's not science .
was the apple falling on newton 's head ,
no , no , that 's true .
you could not possibly be that arrogant .
look , if you weren 't happy with my presentation ,
i didn 't screw it up
i 've had enough of your con@@ descen@@ sion .
maybe i got my doctorate at 24 instead of 16 ,
we 'll take shifts . it won 't be hard .
b@@ ree 's got her trial .
what the hell is this ?
you said the trial was going well .
hey , lee ! sports talk .
i can 't do this anymore , ga@@ by . i have got to step up .
how do you not feel guilty about this ?
we just have to hold on a little longer .
to prove a point about what an honorable guy you are ?
okay@@ .but if things get any worse i 'll have no choice .
stop !
oh ! no . i still wanna sell .
the dead guy was her step@@ father .
absolutely not@@ .i 'm the client . you 're the lawyer .
it 's your call .
do you wanna come inside ?
ben and i are getting married next week ,
jane wasn 't the problem . it 's me .
i guess we can both agree ...
look ... i 'm sorry i missed the cake tasting , sweetheart .
leaves in her hair@@ .@@ she was ..
yes .
a sho@@ vel .
rene@@ e , what did you just do ?
what you said in there could really hurt b@@ ree .
friends aren 't supposed to turn on each other .
what is that supposed to mean ?
hey just so we 're clear , i didn 't want to testify against b@@ ree .
i made a promise to my friends .
do you understand that ? you are going to go to prison .
good . you should be scared .
i don 't understand .
i 'm also somebody who ... really ..
it was carlos .
or anyone else .
it was self-@@ defen@@ se@@ .@@ ale@@ jan@@ dro broke into her house ,
and don 't worry , they 're taking the furniture .
well , l 'll tell them exactly what happened that night .
honey , it 's 2 : 00 in the morning . are you okay ?
really ?
you know , five years ago ,
why would i put you on the stand ?
i can testify that rene@@ e was so stin@@ king drunk ,
i think i can , uh ... fit you in next monday .
do i look like i 'm gonna make it to monday ?
what the hell ? why don 't you take a seat ?
let 's not talk about that right no@@ w.@@ i don 't want them seeing this on the news .
when you 're in a family like me and the girls ,
so when , uh , ga@@ by 's step@@ father came back .
your honor , had no idea .
i thought she was gonna dis@@ credit rene@@ e perry .
given the testimony of the last witness , l have to .
ms. stone ?
ms. stone , is there anyone else
all right , in that case .
that 's all .
greg@@ g told me that you broke up with him
and just like that ,
we 'll just have a long chat once you 've settled in . okay ?
and this was the beginning .. of the end .
that , and i decided i just wasn 't into women anymore .
the women don 't shave , and the men carry pur@@ ses .
i don 't know@@ .it 's so big . it 's a whole department .
ga@@ by , don 't you know how smart and talented you are ?
yeah@@ .you know what ? you 're right .
i don 't even know how to talk to employees .
oh , please . that sad sack was a mor@@ on .
i 've been cra@@ ving chocolate constantly .
mm , thank you .
is that your lawyer friend ?
i thought you liked him .
yeah , l didn 't want to bra@@ g in front of the girls , but it 's worth a few bucks .
well just look at our last financial statement .
oh ! have a seat .
she 's sleep@@ ing@@ .i don 't think it 'll be long now .
no.@@ this is our time together we 'll be fine .

let 's go inside and get started on our wed@@ ded bl@@ iss , eh ?
well , can you give me till the end of the day ?
look , b@@ ree ... all those ugly details you 're talking about , i ...
i don 't want to love an ide@@ al@@ .i w@@ ann@@ a-@@ i wanna love a real person .
all those years ago , when ...
that is the most shameful thing in my life .
fair enough .
i 'm sorry .
it was a tough time for both of us .
our roles are reversed now , but we can 't start drifting away from each other .
we should start there .
i 'd prefer to start in front ,
how intertwined they are .
i should really go with these spinal canals .
if i don 't relieve the pressure on her lungs ,
do you think she really wants to live ?
she doesn 't seem stupid . doesn 't even seem all that scared .
people do things every day
what are her chances of surviving the surgery ?
so is it worth it ? hey , come on .
she 's 43@@ . it 's worth a try .
ok , but i think it 's worth talking to him again , pushing him
ok ..
it 's best you 'd not scru@@ b in
you know , they call you the nazi .
dr. conser@@ va , 37@@ 42 . dr. conser@@ va , 37@@ 42 , stat .
the surgery is going to be long and difficult ,
there 's always that risk , but if we don 't do the surgery ...
i guess i 'll have the surgery .
on one condition . i don 't want him there .
if he 's in the surgery , i 'm not having it .
ok , miss conn@@ ors .
what the hell did you do ?
man@@ . the mike must have been on .
the micro shouldn 't have been on .
now you won 't realize your chance to scru@@ b in .
i got the history on the tumor .
a year and a half it 's the first time she 's even had it looked at .
why doesn 't she get banned ?
you can 't ask me to scru@@ b in , when i haven 't earned it .
you can 't treat me like cra@@ p when i haven 't earned that .
i got myself into this mess , and i ...
i don 't ... know that yet .
you did great work here today .

well , he 's always saying
you know , i do work at a pharmaceutical company .

he knows where the soup kitchen is .
i don 't think i like the way you 're treating my friend .
you want the book or not ?
friendship .
the mineral and rock show ?
so what am i supposed to do now ?
this isn 't funny .
i 've heard those words so many times .
too bad .

wall street loves to use confusing terms
so here 's mar@@ got rob@@ bie in a bubble bath to explain .
they made billions and billions on their 2 fee
after all , there are only so many homes
thank you , ben@@ ter .
by the way , these risky mortgages are called sub@@ prime .
so now he 's going to " short " the bonds .
good .
how do you know the bonds are worthless ?
look , i don 't think that they even know what they 've made .
it 's a time bomb , and i want to short it .
there are no insurance contracts or options for mortgage bonds .
lawrence .
and then
hey ! excuse me !
fine . okay , goldman . you 're right .
when he was a kid he ex@@ cel@@ led at studying
paul is a fine boy , and mark is an excellent student
he 's looking for inconsistencies in the word of god !
later , bau@@ m started his own fund on wall street
but then a tragedy happened to mark ,
the therapist called . you did it again .
i worry about you , mark .
you 're running around like you have to right every wrong in the world .

it 's not what i mean .
what about the cat , wal@@ sh ?

removing her hippo@@ campus could compromise her memory , her speech .
on cancer patients ?
if you do the surgery , i could lose my memory ?
and if you don 't do the surgery ?
why take the chance ?
putting her brain to sleep
it 's unnecessary .
she 's having hall@@ uc@@ inations .

he walked out . you shouldn 't have told him .
oh . nothing was decided , and besides ,
no , warning owen is the least we can do .
cris@@ tina , we should probably keep
i have a hear@@ t-@@ lung transplant coming in .
two trans@@ plants in one day ?
look , you have to take them no matter what , all right ?
you can 't miss a dose .

you know it .
surgery . remember that ?

take the patient back to holding ,
well , you heard the man .
it 's about time .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm sorry you have to think of us as your bosses now .
or pretend it never happened ..
but there are those times when apologi@@ zing ...
is the biggest mistake of all .
andrew , stop . you really need to think about this .
i had no idea the place came furnished .
this is my house ! now get out !
you bought a lot of houses on this street ,
" one ... "
i like the naked p@@ ant .

with 90 grand .
i 'm out .
i 'm all in .
i don 't need to .
did you come to play ?
three kings .
yes , you should , and then you should " eat it . "
but i still had to twist the knife .
and beth 's ashes , of course ,
no . i don 't think either of us should keep them .
when beth was a girl , it was her favorite place .
you could just do this on your own .
because beth loved you .
and i don 't have a car yet .
10 : 00 will be fine .
if it 's all the same to you , fel@@ icia ,
oh , good .

no , no , no . no , i mean it 's really gonna screw me up .
i need every second to pre@@ p for this meeting .
i just wanted you to have half an hour of fun .
just wondering what beth would think if she could see us now ,
our hate was what killed her .
so maybe she 's thinking , " oh , great . now they get along . "
did she suffer at the end , in her last conscious moments ?
$ 1,000 ? y-@@ you bet $ 6,000 ? what are you , nuts ? !
hands off the table , sir .
my friend ...
he died yesterday .
he said i was on a lucky streak .
but ...
why do i keep winning while other people lose ?
it doesn 't make any sense .
yeah .
that it is .. random .
you 're on a lucky streak .
but what happens when my luck runs out ?
u@@ gh . i know you don 't trust me , paul .
what ?
okay . so what ? you show up at my house and say ,
what ?
prison 's not a very nice place to live .
i just brought that for self-defense .

finally ! next time you drop your girls off for a few hours ,
could have been worse . could have been at my dinner party
my guests were another gay couple who were thinking of adopting a child .
lee , cut me some slack . my husband is missing .
he did ?
let me guess . was she fre@@ aked out ?
she thinks i have it , th-@@ that i could pass it .
i hope you know she 's gonna tell everyone .
look , i told her to stay inside , and to keep the kids home from school .
and set off al@@ arms all over this place ?
i want to keep my family alive .
you 're probably right .
you want to get the base shut down ?
she 's not gonna say anything .
i have no road map .

there 's only one reason people do anything in this world .
i 've been in your shoes .

isn 't it funny ? i mean , how we 've lived
my roommate ? you mean linda ?
oh , god , they seemed so happy together . what was his name ?
what was his name again ?
here we go .
it 's the worst timing for me , ever !
truth is , it 's nice to have some company for a change .
why don 't you tell us your life story ?
yeah ?
so they run a bunch of tests
then i go home , turn on the tv , and they say three weeks .
that 's when you find yourself renting a gun and buying a bullet .
isn 't that right , do@@ dge ?
no , i guess not .
you wanna join me ?
okay , what a fucking we@@ ir@@ do .
who drives around with sho@@ vels ? i don 't trust him .

well , what 's it gonna be , then ? knife ? piano wire ?
don 't tell me they sent a girl to do a man 's job .
unless you 're some sort of team ! is that how this works ?
well , that 's a relief .
you know , do@@ dge , when a man ..

my mother passed away ,
it only took ar@@ mag@@ ed@@ don to give her the courage .
your roommate was your wife .
should have listened to my mother .
you would have liked her .
and she knows her best chance of survival
sure .
there 's no room for you , dude .
i 'll go check the bedro@@ oms .
i mean , we wouldn 't steal anything .
then this one time , ben@@ ny ,
oh , wow . how long was i out ?
yeah .
you picked the tomatoes , you made the sauce .
yes , i harvested the wheat .
i don 't know . it was the best i could do ,
how could anyone abandon this face ?
what 'd you do ? before .
how did you i@@ earn to cook like this ?
my dad had the real talent ,
i think that 's the reason i can never settle
you really have to take care of vinyl .
you really have to love it .

of course . you know how she loves children .
what are we doing ? :
i figure 12 more l@@ aps , and she 'll be asleep .
you know what ?
sleep train ?
yeah , i know what it is .
the point is she learns to put herself to sleep .
before long , everyone 's happy .
i met a woman today a-@@ at the store .
she said you killed martha hu@@ ber .
she said you had a motive .
thank you for letting me off the hook .
well , you found out your son was dating
it wasn 't just that .
oh . is , uh , everything okay ?
well , there 's always a period of adjustment .
he was always thousands of miles away .
well , have you discussed this with him ?
he 's the one thing we agree on .
hmm . hey , why don 't you join us ?
i kin@@ da forgot to pick ' em up .

she stared screaming at me ..
when he showed up and knocked on the door ,
finally , it stopped .
i didn 't notice it so much when i was a child .
why 's that ?
hey , guys .
wh@@ oa . hold on . isn 't that a little extreme ?
i cannot stand by and listen to that baby cry .
even for one minute . if 's more than i can handle .
i cry myself to sleep because my kid is crying .
god ..
i haven 't even gotten to speak to mike .
well .. it 's either talking to your husband

cam , hurry !

lily 's gone for one more night .
and break our two-@@ ni@@ ght-@@ in-@@ a-@@ row rule ?

unless you 're admitting it too soon .
" oh , yeah . live . "
listen , i , uh , got to be discre@@ et .
but , uh , if i 'm not mistaken ,
i 'm trying to get something started here .
are you actually suggesting ...
our way of life is under attack .
i have to go .
that 's all . just think about it .
worth a shot , huh ?
no , that 's not what i meant .
that 's dr. sti@@ eg@@ lit@@ z .
he 's brilliant and scary and impossible to impress .
okay . i 've made an appearance .
come on , now , alex .
dad , i@@ just ..
i had to cheer for the debate team once .
" damn . might as well ask sch@@ rod@@ inger 's cat . "
you 'd think animal planet , but it was mostly cinem@@ ax .
alex , get in here .
yes , quite , quite .
it was so embarrassing .
he doesn 't fall for people who pretend to understand him
but seriously , i-i have a science question
had it .
i had three model rockets as a kid ,
yeah . my dad bought it before he , you know ,
could never bring myself to open it without him .
no , it 's not silly .
ah , yes , disappointing fathers .
i remember for my 16th birthday , my dad bought me a mercedes .
he had barely handed me the keys
anyway ..
well , that 's perfect .
well , if you want to see it again , i got it on video .
thank you for your support .
i was being sar@@ cas@@ tic .
shel@@ don , what am i gonna do ?
what do you know about raising a girl ?
well , i don 't know if that was sar@@ cas@@ m or not .
i was worried you might not check your e-mail .
that one was not me .
my mother 's tex@@ ting you ?
why ?
she 's been reaching out .
you think you 're getting close to her ,

i do ! i do ! come out !
gl@@ oria , tag out . let me give it a shot .
nice game of chicken , claire . she 's gone !
almost ? !
you were wrong about the i@@ pod being a failure .
i don 't even want to talk about your favorite " planet " pluto !
you were going to let me go with him ? !
are you worried ?
not even a little bit .
he 's right , the nobel prize is about the work ,
now , the university is gonna host
uh , yeah . who needs to be lik@@ able
that 's what 's great about you ,
n@@ ope . i 've been trying to get them down for hours .
why doesn 't he like the ni@@ ght-@@ light ?
we can also find out what 's so damn funny about birds .
i don 't know why she 's suddenly so afraid of everything .
hey , swee@@ tie ,
your daddy , when he was in space .
hey , good news .
oh , great , like who ?
look how tiny and scared you look .
that is so cool .
why ?
maybe you should 've called it the bit@@ chy little astronaut .
the fact is , i feel really bad for amy .
well , she didn 't do anything wrong ,
but more than the person , the nobel is about the work .
yes , because of your work on gravitational waves .
i do . but i '@@ m-@@ i 'm really ho@@ gging this conversation .
just give them a chance .
look at , uh , newton , who was a jer@@ k to le@@ ib@@ ni@@ z ,
conducted illicit affairs ,
so , what did everybody think ?
i thought the character of madame bo@@ vary was very inspir@@ ational .
the south side are miscellaneous items .
that 's smart . you 'll probably have to sleep in it for a while .
no ? that 's mr. con@@ lin , the lock@@ smith . he 's been very helpful today .
ok , fine . you win . i won 't go to new york .
that sounds fascinating
oh ! and you gotta try the c@@ incin@@ nat@@ i chil@@ i .
they make it here with cin@@ nam@@ on and chocolate
i 'll try to , yeah . thanks .

anyway , there 's a lot to see in the city .
you know , i 'm sorry . i 'm not getting that .
i 'm just here for a day .
you don 't need more than a day for the zoo .
welcome , mr. stone .
smoking , king-@@ sized bed .
one night . yes .
i 'd like a quiet room , if you have one .

i i@@ ke that word .
i feel like an anomaly .
now i kind of like it . sometimes .
it makes me special , sort of .
no . now here 's what i 'm thinking .
i want to be with you .
i need to be with you . i want to leave my wife .
michael , that 's a big decision . i don 't
i mean , i don 't want to be responsible
it 's been years since i 've felt anything like this .
yeah , that sounds right .
you 're clicking your fork against your teeth .
oh , sorry .
what do i say ? do i smile while i 'm on the phone ?
did you know that ?
try it , go ahead .
have no one to talk to . i have no one to talk to .
i just don 't know what else to do because .
be friendly to the customer .
i want to cry , but i can 't .
is it the z@@ olo@@ ft ?
i sweat onto my pillow every night .
be friendly .
look for what is special about each individual .
our time is limited . we forget that .
soon it 's as if we never existed
someone to love .
1@@ em@@ ember to ..
it 's an antique , slu@@ gger . that 's part of its charm .
what are these words here ?
i don 't .. who are all these people ?
yeah . oh , thanks .
what 's it doing now , daddy ?
oh , swee@@ tie , guests don 't normally
i never went to my prom .
would you like to dance ?
you 're not exactly winning any trop@@ hies
why shouldn 't they be ?
in some cultures , we 'd stand outside of their bedroom
oh , come on , honey .
you can 't see anything .
ha ! the eagle has landed !
want to come in , have a cup of tea ?
'@@ kay . well , good night .
ames , hi . how was the wedding ?
come in , let 's talk .
wine is one of the reasons i 'm in this fix .
okay , forget giant ants .
big or small , i don 't like rabbits .
rabbits do have a respiratory system that would support great size .
maybe that 's what they want to talk about .
really ?
what do you want from me ? i just don 't give a rat 's ass .
for the record , giant rats are possible .
maybe something vagu@@ ely related to life as we know it on this planet ?
it tells me that i am living rent-@@ free right here .
oh , i 'm ready .
when she 's upset , she says , " ack ! " and eats ice cream .
if you were a cat , i would have brought you a las@@ ag@@ na .
no , we haven 't spoken since your abrupt departure last night
yeah , i 'm sorry about that .
oh , honey , i don 't know .
you want me to remove him from the team ?
no , no , that 's okay .
oh , i think we both know the answer to that question .
wh@@ a ... . ? no , it 's okay .
everything 's good .
so , you didn 't get all s@@ nar@@ ky
i 'm glad you pat@@ ched things up with your boyfriend .
it 's always tough when the " l " bomb gets dropped
i dated this one girl ,
now i 'm ready .
these all used to be homes .
mm . kingston man@@ or .
bad people .
i remember a lot of good families
al@@ icia , listen .
that car won 't run , and my leg is mess@@ ed up , okay ?
i don 't want to slow you down .
it 's my hood .
no , i don 't think i 'm better than you ,
m@@ m-@@ mm .
you haven 't lived my life .
of course i do .
i begged you to come with me .
yeah ? well , you should 've stayed gone .
he just seems kind of broken .
really ? over a theory ?
the more you care about something ,
yeah . what can we do to help him ?
every culture has its own rituals and traditions
look , i get that you 're scared , but we just have to push past that .
it 's over-@@ the-@@ top
you seemed like you were so happy ,
i just wanted you to have your dream ,
but if i 'm gonna go through with this ,
stop trying to make this your victory !
i 'm just looking to see

i 've been leaning really hard on the coffee .
ladies night . y@@ ay !
i told her last week that , uh , we 'd do a ladies night .

like a just a night out for te@@ ddy .
or is it just two lesbian m@@ oms and a widow
really , that 's your go to ?
um , uh , we did , uh ,
an ec@@ topic ure@@ ter , or it could be .
you don 't even need to know advanced uro@@ logy for the boards .
total cra@@ p .
i hope you 're happy when you 're alone in the o.@@ r .
she 's gonna get cre@@ amed .
you can 't just pass the boards on raw talent , okay ?
what is the point ?
that 's a great idea , bail@@ ey .
i think we owe it to my guy
dr. slo@@ an , are you arguing surgical protocol
call un@@ os .

cn three . three !
yeah , but wouldn 't it still have been funny if you quit after 10 years ?
pretty bird .

that 's all water under the fridge now , har .

they 're going to know he was coerced .
you 're going to save me ?
i imagine you don 't want to find out ,
if you don 't call the general , you 're as good as dead .
you better have more than that to threaten me with .

hey , guys , guys . i just heard something about a heroin shipment . sh@@ h .

let 's get out of here .
in the legs just as much as the next guy .
playing hot potato with a grenade isn 't much of a strategy .
not gonna make it more than a week .
get in the car .
someone hit the shipment .
who hit the shipment ?
it 's not good right now .
come on , everybody . get over here .
sar@@ ge , come here .
for bringing us all home safe .
no , look , this victory belongs to all of us .
cheers .
nothing .
they 're cops .
we never had that kind of trouble before .
i 've bought myself enough cops . i know what i 'm talking about .
they 're hard cases , not interested in money .
there 's no medicine for it , you just gotta ..
it 's a matter of time before he gets to me .
gr@@ aci@@ e , look , for whatever it 's worth .... ..
don 't run . just stay .
we 'll get to you in a minute .
hey , we got a message from mr. cohen .
what lady ? she 's just one of mickey 's pro skirts , there , pal .
maintain surveillance until he reaches the target location .
we get this shipment , it 's over . no more business .
let 's make sure that doesn 't happen . come on .
if i leave , ke@@ el@@ er died for nothing .
connie !
and , god knows , it was worth it .
i don 't know how to live .
might as well be mickey cohen .
you might even be a fucking angel .
you lose everything and you win the war ...
you lose everything and you lose the war ...
this is sergeant john o '@@ mara of the los angeles police department .
come out quietly with your hands up and you will not be harmed .
i like having only one fork .
fucking had it .
it 's 6 : 55 .
it 's one hour
keep walking , bull , keep walking .
yo , i got a late start .
block the gate . i got to finish this off .
said a prayer for us all
just a half cup , m@@ ack
it doesn 't mean anything . it 's a rub@@ ber-@@ chicken dinner .
you don 't do that to your candidate ,
how can you not understand this is so beyond me .
listen to me
be presidential ,
i 'm fig@@ uring i 'll need a two-@@ inch lift ,
what do you think ?
i ain 't a hero for $ 14 an hour .
i don 't know , sir .
you think he knows i 've been bar@@ king up one of his trees .
this is richard sul@@ lins .
which means
well , let 's be clear ,
now , i 'm sorry
that i was supposed to put around my neck .
18 months ?
is that so ?
forensics is prepared to submit a report detailing
and the escaped con who says that i told him to kill himself .
you can erase me , too .
you know ...
what ?
that 's some real fine work , wheel@@ er .
if i do that , i 'll be cutting .
you know the golden rule of line etiquette :
boy , makes me feel better about my life .
and now i feel worse again .
he 's batt@@ led intimacy issues his whole life .
didn 't even make it out of the parking lot .
let 's talk about you .
dear , i 'm a psychiatrist .
well , i 'd actually like for us to be close ,
penny , it 's only natural to want your mother@@ -in-law to like you ,
uh , for starters ,
you were happy to do this when i hired you .
oh , i 'm not upset with you , but amy 's pretty bent out of shape ,
oh , thanks ! you 're a peach !
bern@@ ade@@ tte , it was a pleasure as always ,
since the airport , dear .
really ?
do i think he 'd be interested ?
wonderful !
um , you should probably talk to penny , too .
okay , you know what ?
i 've been trying to make a connection with you all day ,
what i was seeking was some sort of friendship .
my intention was never to insult you .
but as we get older , making amends ..
you really think i should lie ?
but , you know , what@@ ever@@ . take care now .
i got you a present .
even if you are a fancy plastic surgeon
it 's not money
it 's better than money . wait .
it either means , " you 're dying , and i can 't help "
or it means . " this is really gonna hurt . "
in a few weeks , i 'm gonna be up a tree in utah .
sons of bit@@ ches !
uh , you were bull@@ do@@ zed out of something ?
she was the tree that i was living in for the past six weeks .
k@@ ail@@ i is hawaiian , for " divine beauty and wisdom . "
they 're all gone .
those corporate bast@@ ards !
how does one exactly live in a tree ?
he 's , um , asking where your poo goes ,
excuse me , doctor .
can i help you ?
oh , go@@ sh . i 'm gonna pretend that you didn 't just call me ma am , "
well , i am looking for a doctor .
um , iso@@ bel stevens
after you .
my god ! who 's getting married ? !
what are you doing here ?
but there 's a trauma coming in .
please .
the chief specifically asked me to cover mer in the pit .
finish his cathe@@ ter .
what can we in@@ fer from these injuries ?
let 's make sure we get an accurate count while we have him positioned .
does it hurt when i do this ?
can you tell me how you got this big cut on your face ?
she 's scared she did a bad thing and you 're gonna take her away from me
her daddy shoots targets in the backyard .
it was stupid . it was really stupid .
okay you 'll tell the police that and it 'll be okay .
i 'm so deeply sorry
thank you
and then you remember jade from 114 ? well ..
you used to do all those little exercises like this
nothing 's stopping . he 's still bleeding out .
i need some more suction in there
because i have to deal with him
he doesn 't respect it
okay
so im begging you , please . he 's not invited , okay ?
thank you m@@ m-@@ hmm
you are not a defen@@ seless , tre@@ e-@@ living creature karen .
mom ...
i have stage iv melan@@ oma
that doesn 't make a whole lot of sense .
no . no .
just breathe , okay ? it 's okay .
now ive got a good feeling about this .
really ? you think that
take easy . l-@@ listen , if it 's not , it 's not the end of the world .
yeah . a bucket on a pul@@ ley .
oh , that 's friendship .
you know , they teach us in med school
we do a thousand different things to care a little less .
nice work , yang .
open it and pour it into a sterile basin
uh , uh , we used it in the field all the time .
oh@@ . look at that it 's locking up the entire wo@@ und@@ . it
magical
mets ? like baseball ?
okay , uh , good news great news .
it looks like your psych@@ ic was right , mrs. stevens .
oh , thank you , god ! thank you .
oh , thank you ! oh .
you told her about the ring .
that 's not running a hospital .
you have history with her .
but the way you act you consider her family .
what happened ?
the guy shouldn 't be alive . 17 bullets .
dr. grey me@@ red@@ ith
i know i was out of line , and i know
reminds me of a guy in germany
what happened at cru@@ ising altitude ?
bro@@ dy , let 's order some , uh , bilateral leg films .
but the ice pack is made of blood and muscle tissue ,
e@@ w . gross .
me@@ red@@ ith 's kind of lucky , when you think about it .
well , i mean , yeah , obviously ,
i love a good dare .
thank you .
good to be back ?
but i love being a mom , too .
how amazing and important and just perfect it is ?
i will pass it along .
all right .
the heart 's not stopping .
well , it looks like the blunt injury
how can i help ?
uh , no . a great time , in fact .
there 'll be cake any minute .
it was never meant to be published .
from " hospital hell " ?
and i would never say that .
then have them change it . have them take it down .
i can write a re@@ traction , an explanation .
only a girl would be afraid to come down the ladder .
i 'm not looking at a little gir@@ li@@ e-@@ girl , am i ?
come on .
aside from the adultery , yes .
i would find a way to forgive them .
and you deserve such a special woman .
i don 't know . it happens a little bit at a time .
it 's not complicated . it 's completely irresponsible .
so you 're the victim ?
we 're not done .
i can 't believe you 're just upro@@ oting us like this .
here . you wanna get it about like this .
just fl@@ ashes from when i was little .
what kind of things ?
and d@@ ana .
don 't fall for it .
exactly . a very beautiful , class@@ y lady .
obviously , i 'm not leaving my husband and marrying john .
i 'll talk to john tomorrow and give back the ring .
hey , bob , i get why she 's so angry with me .
you 're right . you 're right . i guess i just got so upset because ..
it 's over . i 'm sorry . good night .
i know . of course . you 're not your father .
because if you ever betra@@ y me . i will leave you .
how am i supposed to patch it out here ?
i 'm not always gonna be here to help you .
why did you and mom name me after something that 's bad ?
what it means is whatever can happen will happen .
get in .
what about the flat tire ?
this way :
nicely done .
delhi mission control went down , same as ours
why did it come down so low ?
maybe the sun cooked its brain or it was looking for something
come on . you 're a well-@@ educated man , co@@ op .
and an engineer .
we didn 't run out of television screens and planes . we ran out of food .
the soviets bank@@ rupted themselves pouring resources
one of those useless machines they used to make was called an mri .
then she 'd have been the one listening to this instead of me ...
but six billion people ... just try to imagine that .
his world isn 't so bad
and your kids know it . especially mur@@ ph .
at our place in the stars .
cooper , you were good at something ..
i 'm sorry .
to turn on you like that and destroy you .
this happened about 1 : 30 when that thing ... came off the top of that canyon .
kind of an accident . we sort of stum@@ bled upon it . we were on a salvage run ..
nobody stum@@ bles in here . nobody stum@@ bles out .
what sort of anomaly ?
you 're going to have to be specific , mr. cooper . right now
now , i 'm real happy that you 're excited about gravity , bud
like , that we 're getting out of here . and i don 't mean in the trunk of some car .
no , professor , i don 't .
we 're nasa .
for refusing to drop bombs from the strat@@ osphere onto starving people .
in secret .
because public opinion wouldn 't allow spending on space exploration .
bl@@ ight .
now there 's just corn .
but like the potatoes in ireland and the wheat in the dust bowl
earth 's atmosphere is 80 percent nitrogen . we don 't even breathe nitrogen .
the last people to star@@ ve will be the first to suff@@ oc@@ ate .
will be the ast to survive on earth .
yeah . thank you .
we 're not meant to save the world . we 're meant to leave it
our final expedition .
get out there and save them .
we started detecting gravitational anomalies almost 50 years ago .
t@@ n fact , i believe you encountered one yourself
exactly .
and it leads where ?
a wor@@ m@@ hole 's not a naturally occurring phenomenon .
" they " ?
that wor@@ m@@ hole lets us travel to other stars . it came along right as we needed it .
twelve , in fact , from our initial probes .
we sent people into it . ten years ago .
twelve possible worlds , twelve ran@@ ger launches carrying .
each person 's landing pod had enough life support for two years .
then they could send out a signal , bed down for the long nap , wait to be rescued
some clue as to which worlds have potential .
one . that 's a bit of a long shot , isn 't it ?
no long shot .
this entire facility 's a centrifu@@ ge .
both . fl@@ an a. " how do you get it off the ground ?
so i started working on a theory and we started building this station .
that 's why there 's plan b .
plan b : a population bomb .
how would you raise them ?
within 30 years , we could have a colony of hundreds .
this takes care of that .
you give up on them ? my kids ?
i give you my word .
mur@@ ph .
this world was never enough for you , was it , co@@ op ?
and it exc@@ ites me ? he@@ h .
it might . don 't trust the right thing done for the wrong reason .
tom will be all right , but you got to make things right with mur@@ ph .
you have to talk to me , mur@@ ph .
then i 'll keep it broken so you have to stay .
she said , " now .
once you 're a parent , you 're the ghost of your children 's future .
that 's right , mur@@ ph .
i can 't be your ghost right now .
mur@@ ph , they chose me . you saw . you 're the one who led me to them .
i figured out the message .
mur@@ ph .
we have each other . dr. i@@ ann had it worse
no , it 's not like looking for a new con@@ do .
adri@@ ft
they all knew the odds against ever seeing another human being again .
how about tan@@ n ?
why are you in my dad 's truck ?
he sent you a message .
if you record any messages , i can get them to transmit it to cooper .
maybe i should fan the flame .
so maybe she should come and make a fool out of you .
heading for mars .
administration wants me to repeat plant pathology . which suc@@ ks .
all right , i got to go , dad . hope you 're safe up there .
i asked mur@@ ph to say hi , but she 's as stubborn as her old man .
you all right , rom ?
of course it is . what , you .... . ? you thought it would just be a hole ?
in the illustrations , they 're trying to show you how it works .
but it 's too far , right ?
we 're .
so the lost communications came through .
the relay on this side c@@ ached them .
miller 's site has kept p@@ inging thum@@ bs up , as has dr. mann 's .
transmitter failure ?
but miller 's still looks good though , right ?
it 's what we 're calling the black hole .
and miller 's is on the horizon ?
landing there takes us dangerously close .
the gravity on that planet will slow our clock compared to earth 's drastically .
every hour we spend on that planet will be .
jesus .
well , we can 't just drop down there without ..
yeah , do@@ yle , we have a mission , and our mission plan a is ..
i am thinking about my family and millions of other families , okay ?
no . it doesn 't . that 's why there 's a plan b .
all right , look .
and ed@@ m@@ unds ' , it 's even further .
you don 't find that every day . no , you don 't .
that would be spent trying to get back here .
just back from the cus@@ p .
right .
here 's gar@@ gan@@ tu@@ a . here 's miller 's planet .
which would conserve fuel , but we would lose a lot of time
if we could just see the collapsed star inside ...
and we can 't get anything from it ?
not even light .
then let 's succeed
with respect , professor , we 've tried that hundreds of times .
every ri@@ vet that they strike could have been a bullet .
finish it with one arm .. no , with both arms tied behind your back .
i 'm an old man , mur@@ ph .
i want to talk to my daughter .
murphy 's law . whatever can happen will happen .
but when you 're orbiting a black hole not enough can happen .
we need to go further a@@ field .
and yet ... yet here he is .
granted , but ed@@ m@@ unds ' data is more promising .
well , if we vote , there 's something you should know .
that has nothing to do with it .
you 're a scientist , brand
observable , powerful .
love has meaning yes . social utility , social bonding , child rearing
yet understand .
arti@@ fact of a higher dimension that we can 't consciously perceive .
love is the one thing we 're capable of percei@@ ving ..
maybe we should trust that , even if we can 't understand it yet .
yes .
that doesn 't mean i 'm wrong .
it might .
i need to vet back .
i need to .
we might have something for that . hey , co@@ op .
lo@@ is , i have a friend who ..
no , this wasn 't a personal decision .
your fuel calculations are based on a return journey .
starting a colony could save us from extinction .
and the future of the human race
we were trying to reach you .
i 'm here , professor .
no , you got us so far . real close .
pray you never learn ...
i hadn 't a lot of hope to begin with , but
the last time i went to sleep , i didn 't even set a waking date .
yeah ?
yeah , what 's that ? have one last crack at the black hole .
yeah , i know . this isn 't going to cost you any time .
talk to me .
what happens after it crosses ?
so , what 's to say there isn 't some way that the probe ..
if he 's equipped to transmit every form of energy that can pulse .
tas is the obvious candidate
how long have you had that cough ?
mom lets me play in here .
just take this gently .
dad 's not coming back . he never was coming back . it 's up to me .
dad didn 't even try ! dad just abandoned us !
you gonna wait for your next kid to die ?
neither of us has time to worry .
i 'm sorry , cooper .
apparently .
roger . i have it .
t can do this . i can do this .
not just any child .
mur@@ ph , the fire 's out ! come on !
i get that , ta rs .
cooper .
say that again .
no , they didn 't bring us here at all .
nice and easy , mr. cooper .
take it slow , sir
currently orbiting saturn .
nice of you to name it after me .
the station isn 't named after you , sir . it 's ... named after your daughter .
i was delighted to hear that she thought it was perfect .
of course , i didn 't speak to her personally .
glasses or cups , whatever it was , up@@ side-@@ down .
there just wasn 't enough food .
i don 't care who describes it , there is no way for it to be exaggerated .
oh , she did , did she ?
home sweet home . everything replaced and put back where it .
oh , yeah .
i do , yeah , so many things ...
jesus .
eddie can@@ tor , only not totally jewish looking .
if you knew su@@ sie like i know su@@ sie ...
it would be easy if i was , san@@ cho .
but i am bound to honor the code of kni@@ ght-@@ er@@ rant .
i 'm very sorry .
oh never was there a knight
you can 't blind me with your mirrors .
keep away !
shit . what did i do ?
javier , come back !
well , he 's my ride .
you and your film destroyed good people !
that 's what they want you to do .
it is our story , san@@ cho , not some pretend ...
great fortune smiles on us .
my fair lady has forgiven me .
tell her that don qui@@ x@@ o@@ te de la man@@ cha ,
have you learned nothing at my side , hmm ?
it 's 100 % colombian , it 's right there on the table .
i just don 't think i want you seeing me like this .
you know , i kept calling out for you in emergency .
they thought that you were the one who ..
i don 't know .
so i had a date last night .
there were three guys inside .
he spoke real strong , like a fighter .
this is a house@@ keeper you 're talking to , remember ?
glad you don 't .
he 's from a fine old italian family back east .
how big are they ?
you did me something once .
but now , i need you to do me something .
don 't mind the noise .
it 's just a short drive down the block .
this isn 't as nice as some of those other places .
how did you get into this line of work ?
trained to run around all comman@@ do .
" s " for shut your mouth .
i can take care of things . that 's all you need to know .
are you always so tou@@ chy ?
can i get a fiji water , please ?
nick@@ y ? vod@@ ka double
i want my revenge , nick@@ y .

you 're not supposed to like vegas .
sweet dreams .
i 'm gonna sail the mediterranean before i die .
that 's very kind of you , duke .
i don 't get you .
five years would only be fine at first .
not today .
i lied about my friend recommending you .
i knew everything about you , i 've researched you .
and the double vod@@ ka .
i need something from you and i 've come too far for a no answer .
i got so fucking mad
and so i 've come to you .
you want to sail the mediterranean ,
i earned 70 million dollars by the time i was 19
it was nothing
you 've got to help me .

he could kill you with this
it 's the perfect cover .

you 're not buying this cra@@ p , are you , baby ?
you know what ? i 'm not stripping
nicholas is risking his life
you and i will go in the other room ,

he 's a very mach@@ o little s@@ lime .
you know he 'll come for you .
really needed this now .
maybe it 's not so terrible .
okay , duke . i admit it .
'm a trapped compul@@ sive
no , but you might have taken
doubtful for two reasons , the first being the lack of funding .
now i 'm going to have to hire an emergency crew to come
are you insane ? max , i can 't .
come on .
isn 't this one of those " windows of opportunity " ?
i had to stay on scene .
why did you call 9@@ 11 in the first place ?
wait , wait ! open ! open !

that 's my sister@@ -in-law 's . jane , good news .
hi , jane . i 'm dr. a@@ very .
it 's bad , honey .
this is all gigan@@ tor 's fault .
i didn 't mean to pull so hard .
he didn 't suggest to play tu@@ g-@@ of-@@ war with a clo@@ thes@@ line .
okay , k@@ ell@@ ers , i 'm back
we can 't eat , al .
the condition is fatal .
we 'll let you hold him when he 's stable ,
and if you don 't make it in time , he could die ?
it 'll give us more time .
can you do that ?
there are about a thousand reasons why not .
nobody cares . kare@@ v ? all right .
it was the height of idi@@ oc@@ y ,
i cover the sop@@ hom@@ ore beat for my school paper .
and now my hand is ruined and my career is over .
your hand is going to be just fine .
okay ? and ...
okay ?
all right . so do you have any questions before we start ?
can i get that back ?
but what if it 's not ?
no ! stop .
not right now .
and you all know that when he comes out ,
your baby 's life depends on it ,
we 're all doing our best to save your baby 's life .
okay . one more time . one more time .
right .
just confirm what i have so far .
you don 't even have to say anything .
let it go , wood@@ ward .
it 's not the hospital . it 's one doctor .
she 's been isolated ,
the o.@@ r. has been tested . it 's clean .
do what you have to .
you cleared to scru@@ b in ?
okay , pre@@ p him .
of course not .
baby 's looking good .
dr. miranda bail@@ ey .
but the real cul@@ pri@@ t here is the gloves .
we switched
microscopic tears in the gloves , which facilitated
mr. clea@@ ver went on to demand an immediate ...
what ?
i thought the move would be
my mother gave us that rug .
it 's just a comic , jack .
it 's not just a comic .
yeah .
working on your sun@@ tan , huh ?
well , you 're in luck , soldier .
we know this because we are everywhere they are .
ha@@ kim abdullah jam@@ al .
i 'll get the sheets and blankets for the couch .
no , i can 't authorize that .
the ham@@ mur@@ ab@@ ic code is " an eye for an eye , "
and a living will and durable power of attorney .
as your friend , let 's hope it doesn 't come to that .
did you sign this ?
you get to pull the plug on him , too .
congratulations and welcome temporarily aboard .
what 's wrong with me , penny ?
you know , if we weren 't friends ,
okay , okay . mom , i gotta eat something before school .
i still have to go to the grocery store .

you 're kidding . i went to college with him .
yeah .
yeah . thanks .
when he came into a room , people noticed .
what ? why ?
but he was just bold .
yeah . wow . i 've never heard any of this about him before .
well , you 've come to the right ta@@ vern . table 12 .
that 's a children 's menu .
now ...
i 'm sorry , but you are not getting this map .
okay , i can handle this .
i followed my gut .
but the expressway is faster .
i know you want this to be
yeah , you 're right .
your boys are in grave danger ! but i can help !
i know where they 're going ! we can still save them !
i don 't .
i mean , okay , well ...
i mean , i 'm late for work .
i mean tired . sick and tired . gotta go !
old gore can 't be tied down .
can you put me through to officer col@@ t bron@@ co ?
the magic said it for you .
magic doesn 't get it wrong !
right ?
all i know is that everything we 've done tonight has gone wrong .
are you kidding ?
but you didn 't do it my way .
great ! then i think we should take the path of peril .
see ?
all that matters today is dad ,
what is he doing ?
he is terrible .
no . here he comes .
i 'm good . stop .
no , no , no !
just imagine what the top half of this dance looks like .
great !
hello , old friend . we shall never part again .
so , let 's call it 10,000 .
col@@ t , i can 't talk . the boys need me .
d@@ ang those kids .
well , good morning to thee , dear light@@ foot men .
it 's not much of a path .
so , heads up , we could run into anything .
look around for a lever .
but it 's on the other side .
alo@@ ft elev@@ ar .
so , what other spells do you know ?
i know all there is to know of magic .
we just have to get to them before they unle@@ ash the curse .
a what dragon ?
i just know we have to get to the boys fast .
well , i almost had ' em , but ian , he just drove off .
what ?
thinks something 's gonna come at him out of the ...
are you okay ? where did you come from ?
are you all right ?
no . our transport !
come on , pix@@ ie du@@ sters , let 's take to the skies .
how do you feel about exercising those wings ?
careful how much boat you 're eating there , man ,
i can 't believe i 'm this close to actually talking to dad .
if he ever gave himself a wizard name .
well , ' cause he was into magic .
al@@ ora the maj@@ estic .
anyway , it 'll just be nice to have more than four memories of him .
the phoenix gem is just on the other side .
this place is , like , 1,000 years old .
oh , no .
the pen@@ thouse .
why i even knocked on the door is beyond me .
.. nobody knows what that means . it 's safer for everybody involved .
we 're just the middle men .
right .
that 's ... that 's limit@@ less .
it could have no downside . i mean , except for your russian partners .
ok , so how do you think hag@@ ger@@ ty fits in ?
hag@@ ger@@ ty 's gonna be indicted any minute now , ok ?
that 's the truth .
yeah , well , i just think this business is questionable as it is ,
i don 't know , not right about it . you know ? the guy 's saving our life .
it wouldn 't be hag@@ ger@@ ty . it would be me . i 'd be the one at risk .
we wouldn 't provide a frame of content .
and then i did the right thing . i took care of hag@@ ger@@ ty
yeah . these guys are lun@@ atics .
wait a minute . just hold it .
nice . i 'll ... i 'll take the money .
i 'll take it , yeah .
they said they owed $ 400,000 ,
i figured with the potential of the business ,
within an hour , some big russian named ivan was at my door .
can i get you a drink or anything ?
ok , i 'm just trying to be friendly .
your money ? i thought this was nik@@ ita 's money .
what are we gonna do ?
what about the money ?
the guy 's dead . what do you . ?
right , but they don 't know that , so that 's how we need to keep it .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
hey , you ok ?
here you go . will you hold these ?
yeah .
you can 't eat those , honey .
ok , let 's go get something to eat .
wherever you want .
you ok , baby doll ?
it 's so nice to have you home .
some eat plankton , some eat other fish .
look , have one of these .
nik@@ ita , you wanna .. you wanna tell me what 's going on ?
i don 't know what to tell you about that . maybe he 's off part@@ ying ,
four
well , that 's not what he told me .
i 'm not saying anything , all right ?
no offense here , but it 's sounding to me like you might have gotten ripped off .
after a few months , the warehouse owner asked us to move .
in no time at all , we had enough money to buy our own building .
go slow with that one .
every time i came home , it was this wonderful home@@ coming .
hey , sugar .
but i knew it couldn 't last .
dad !
i was throwing houses , gifts and cars
all right , so let me guess .
your wife and kids become total strangers ,
sorry . i didn 't mean to strike a nerve or anything .
i mean , and you 're making what ? close to 100 million ?
that ain 't right . that ain 't right .
" thanks for putting this all together , jerry . "
really ?
yeah , well , see , the problem is i don 't really see it like that , jack .
no . no , you see , we 're not finished .
we can 't be . listen , you killed ivan , right ?
hey , fuck jack . and that little plan of yours
how ab@@ out@@ . how about the three of us ?
yeah , yeah .
fuck jack .
boys ! come on .
better call your husband instead .
don 't fuck around with me .
i got it . all right ? i 'm on my way . just don 't do anything , all right ?
what the hell is this ? this is the boy .
this is boy from house .
nik@@ ita , do you not understand the english that we 're speaking ?
his mother is the house@@ keeper . this is a mexican person .
you think jack 's gonna give a shit about this ?
hey , is it a bag of ham@@ mers or a bag of hair that you have for brains ?
it 's a mexican boy .
we gotta get the fuck out@@ ta here .
no , i got a bad feeling .
you are not going anywhere .
ok , ok , ok ! ok , ok !
i know this man . he will pay .
go on , suz@@ ie ! go get ' em !
let 's put some hands together for the monkeys !
there .
get me harry de@@ ane .
yes , he 's expecting you .
oh , i am sorry , sir .
we 'll try and get it into next month 's . de@@ ane , sit down .
i 've sent the plane to collect this woman .
interesting . oh , i see , the painting .
bloody hell . based on what ?
yes , precisely . but whose carav@@ an , you plan@@ k ?
pu@@ z@@ now@@ ski , de@@ ane .
welcome to london .
mon@@ et 's hay@@ st@@ acks .
" hay@@ st@@ acks , dawn " was traded amongst various private collectors
that is , until the nazi occupation of 1941 .
in 1945 , car@@ in@@ hall is overrun by the first division of patt@@ on 's army ,
your grandfather .
and what is all this to sha@@ ban@@ dar ?
i 'm trying to get ..
those people are barb@@ arians .
how are we going to meet this woman ?
she 's surrounded by a cro@@ -@@ mag@@ non swiss guard .
you boys ok , huh ?
yes , thank you . all present and correct .
nose been broke so many times , he had the carti@@ lage taken out
would you care to wait ?
lion@@ el sha@@ ban@@ dar explains his formula for success
sha@@ ban@@ dar media . creating ..
without wanting to over@@ state things , i would say it may be my favourite ...
do you ride ?
that is , i have ridden .
it was my friend bobby mon@@ ta@@ ign@@ e 's birthday party .
and how well i remember it . made a deep impression , sir .
yes , sir , there is . thank you .
i was struck most particularly by the piece on this p@@ j pu@@ z@@ now@@ ski ,
so , how do you find london ?
you turn right at greenland .
er , well , one of them , erm , big hotels downtown .
what are you doing ?
hello . do you have a single room ?
certainly , sir . i 'll just take a look .
we are rather hem@@ med in at the moment , sir .
we 'll take it .
ho@@ ss , if you 're gonna nick@@ el-@@ and-@@ di@@ me me , we can call this whole thing off .
what would my mom@@ ma have said
i 'm not remotely ashamed .
sir , i already have .
bloody hell . alright , try the .. this is a mistake . try the american express .
you or the major .
there you are . that 's room 344 .
the man is not above mixing the professional with the personal
don 't make me say it . the man is ... well , he 's a cad .
und i 'm now considered as the top man on mon@@ et .
i mean , for someone from the country of germany .
und i 'm internet@@ -@@ sav@@ vy , but you have to be these days , don 't you think ?
ja , ja .
anyway , tell me this remarkable thing .
ye@@ p .
so , harry 's out on his butt , huh ?
he 's a bit of a disappointment , really .
i don 't know .
not that bright .
these are the moments that try men 's souls .
he 's ... no problems ?
no , he was polite enough .
these , madam , are pounds and p@@ ence , not quarters .
i bag the coins and donate the proceeds to charity .
so where do we stand with our little affair , scheme , programme ?
what ? nonsense . everything 's going according to plan .
well , then , i guess it 's just me having second thoughts , then .
don 't young lady me , ho@@ ss .
that is it .
you call the major , tell him about your second thoughts , your silly little ...
yeah , that 's part of it .
i happen to think he 's quite charming .
and look at you , tr@@ ash@@ -@@ tal@@ kin ' my origins !
leaves me vulnerable ? i don 't know how to tell you this , harry .
oh , i 'm fired ?
very am@@ using .
and it is you who are fired ! except you 're not .
wrong , ho@@ ss . wrong , wrong and wrong .
i refer not just to my nose ,
don 't be an ass . i 'm hardly likely to be hit in the face a third time .
this isn 't a maths class .
yes , thank you .
the japanese ran the world in the ' 80s
so it 's kind of like a gru@@ dge match .
oh , that 's where it is . excuse me .
evening , mr de@@ ane .
right , shan 't bother you again
good evening , sir . did you find your glasses ?
not forgetting anything else , are we , sir ?
at least he 's wearing a tie .
good morning .
no , not at all . it 's just that seduc@@ ing sha@@ ban@@ dar ,
you 're not lion@@ el , and why would you wanna be ?
but you gotta quit trying to be something you 're not .
look , i understand how certain unforeseen wrink@@ les in my plans
p@@ j could well have been ma@@ ul@@ ed , and all to no end .
sorry , de@@ ane , it isn 't your job .
i 've got a new man . it was a bloody ch@@ ore hiring him .
and there are certain things that you cannot phon@@ ey up .
i mean , this is , i have to say , really quite bloody marvel@@ l@@ ous .
either way , it 's clear that you 're of no further use to me .
it was hanging on a wall in a trailer in texas .
well , no harm done .
well , de@@ ane , against expectations ,
now , if you 'll excuse me ..
you think not what ?
i 'm afraid i can no longer render services
so did i .
find out what 's going on .
we had a deal .
based on the medi@@ ocr@@ ity of your performance
apparently michael 's a little more head@@ strong than either of us imagined .
we have a lead on him somewhere in central arizona .
if you speak to michael ,
2,500 miles to go .
should we call lincoln ? let him know we 're coming ?
and for what it 's worth , i might 've done the same thing .
actually , it 's not .
i don 't believe that 's true .
you 're saying my mom 's in miami ?
she 's a company agent .
lin@@ c ..
oh , no .
it 's actually a bir@@ d@@ house kit .
i didn 't talk to her for two days after that ,
goodness .
as soon as you see that ..
you 'll never get that open .
can you open the side door ?
sara .
i don 't think we 're going to be able to move this .
christina ?
there are people out looking for us .
just a little while longer , only a few more days .
i understand what you think your role is in all of this ,
oh , look .
jonathan .
it 's good to hear your voice .
mr. bur@@ rows .
you haven 't changed a bit .
i know it wasn 't the most straightforward
i 'm sure you have many questions .
suffice it to say . i couldn 't protect you then ,
once he is dealt with ,
i need two days
.. then i can give you and michael
i 'm going to get started right away .
and for that reason ,
once we pull this box down ,
what is your move ?
there they go , come on .
we 're investigating a cruelty to animal charge .
worse than the place down the street we shut down .
sit down .
but we 're not going to know that until we take a look around .
that is our sanctuary .
i understand your concerns , but i need to go back there .
best i can do is have you accompany us , please .
till they were on their way home
things had gotten so bad ,
you 're un@@ believable ! you 're so cheap .
i 'm not buying you a new car .
it isn 't even a holiday .
you beat cancer , i 'll buy you a car .
what ?
what ? ! no ! you piece of cra@@ p !
and that is how the unhappy marriage ,
by the name of wi@@ ster@@ ia lane .
brought out their candy can@@ es ..
of course ,
that 's funny . did you hear that ?
okay . how about some christmas music ?
do we really want the kid working with electricity ?
you 're clum@@ ping .
i don 't want to get into it .
this is the time we should come together
hey what 's going on ?
oh , my god . i was just there five minutes ago .
well , she was really upset .
but you definitely said your name was tyler .
my name 's danny .
um , can i see my mom ?
i 'm sorry . not while you 're under observation .
but we still need your insurance information , mr . bol@@ en .
like us not being able to see our kid ?
what do you mean ?
i mean ... you never talk about your past .
having no insurance , wanting to pay cash for everything ,
you 're in the witness protection program , aren 't you ?
how 'd you figure it out ?
once i noticed you were italian , i just kin@@ da went from there .
none taken .
i suppose the fact that you did believe me ,
for what it 's worth ,
here 's ka@@ therine 's room .
really ?
it doesn 't make any sense .
well , if you must know
even though i am so angry with him ,
so how did it go ?
i can 't tell if she 's crazy or just devi@@ ous
only a family member
it 'll be okay .
so we 'll run out right before the babies are born .
ah , like food , clothing , sober mother ?
for what ?
you have to drop out of school .
i have really , really scre@@ wed this up .
yeah . won 't that be great ?
maybe it 's your turn .
whatever it is , i can explain .
love , karl . "
i don 't care . you can 't put a price on love .
$ 20 gift certificate to a rib joint .
so the gift was for both of us .
i hope this b@@ ree says yes ..
for what it 's worth , i 'm a divorce lawyer .
jeff , look at the mess in here !
our therapist said we need to do more stuff together .
would it kill you to spend some time with the woman you love ?
as long as she doesn 't defl@@ ate in the plane .
you know why ? because you are awful .
okay ,
and you have every right to go to hell .
i do . i care about my friends .
i 'm in .
we can 't just let some stupid house@@ wife
we gotta try to make this go away .
i just thought i 'd come by
what 's the big deal ?
or@@ son doesn 't know .
if 's not funny . karl .
yeah , about that ..
don 't you dare give me a present
mm , i 'm sticking with " no . "
i just heard it , too .
but i did sell one to kobe bryant .
and i have a very funny story , actually .
that 's hil@@ arious .
okay , um ... oh !
it is in my court .
come on . let me see ' em .
gil pick@@ les .
so much better than my phil@@ -@@ low cases .
one of him in bed is more than enough .
all right . just hit " send . "
give her a round of applause , everybody .
i wanna thank you kids for having me here today .
but i will tell him what you said .
you know , your little meltdown in there got me thinking .
are you offering me a job ?
and for the safety of you and your family ,
that went on for a while .
i can 't be the only one who gets hungry in there !
that 's fantastic .
i think claire 's going through some pretty dark stuff ,
what do you mean ?
let 's go .
you want to go to the park and get ice cream or what ?
you look hungry .
no girls like her at school . she is distant and basically ,
so why did you give me your card ?
i left my home about a year or so ago .
i was drinking my ass off standing on a subway platform
oh , no , it 's real
there are two sets of keys on the table in there .
you 're due at the label later this afternoon
ow sweet is this girl ? i o@@ ve that .
how great are these guys ? i love them .
yeah , thank you so much
il 's the back i like
this is the actual size of my penis . "
want to hear it ?
would you be interested in that ?
it just happened . i .
i just .... i have to see it through .
obviously ...
i don 't remember if you take sugar or ..
hey , you should come and sing on a track .
it 's gonna be simple . you should come play .
uh , it just proves that a guy from nowhere can actually make it
uh , go@@ sh , thank you .
fuck off !
i 'm in the fucking zone .
i 'm gonna write a song .
what is " this " ?
however , um , dr. web@@ ber has offered to take over .
i 'll take bl@@ ake .
i 'm chief of general . it 's the job .
of course . i 'll do it .
oh , no , i 'm not parking . i 'm just stopping for a sec .
yeah , yeah , i got a patient . no worries .
obviously . i ... i sk@@ ipped that .
we 're a level i trauma center .
bl@@ ake , get him ready for transport .
it 's not enough to have her here in the same building .
i am trying to rise above .
no , you should have ended it that night .
it was better when we weren 't talking .
both sides .
all right , he doesn 't have the time
why 'd you even bring him to me ?
you knew this was hopeless .
i don 't know why you are .
dr. grey , dr. bl@@ ake .
thank you , sir . it 's been ...
great . how 's she doing ? not too well .
what did you miss ?
what did i do that you missed ?
you would 've killed the patient , bl@@ ake .
it 's that simple .
what 's wrong ?
i 'm new .
if she cracks under the pressure of an emer@@ gent surgery ,
her references were imp@@ ec@@ cable . i checked them myself .
so you knew where she was from ?
her losses ?
she was an excellent candidate .
and you didn 't find that reason enough ?
that 's good news .
got an e-mail from our bishop .
he is young , so ..
we could wire them with rib gra@@ fts .
that was one reason .
when you were accepted to this program ,
and you walked in ,
here@@ . every day .
i decided to put aside my personal feelings to ...
and i 'm glad i did that .
he would have said the same thing .
not for long , i imagine .
i was , most of the time .
we 'll never let as an empty handed .
look at the broo@@ ch .
this is a special kind of bird .
enough to pay for all our heads ?
jor@@ und ! take your hands away !
a@@ ye@@ -@@ aye ..
we were attacked by vi@@ kings .
no , my king .
they 're at least dozen of them .
but , my king
it was served a lesson to your officers have subjects
we know everything we need to know .
otherwise , they would not climb of the cliff .
you need not look twice to see she is working them
and i will award you , hand@@ som@@ ely .
my father is dead .
so either you continues with this
do not do it again .
you cannot kill me . dead i am not worthless to you .
your family will still pay full prize .
since this is obviously not your land
you might find shelter this way .
you do not have to .
and get the fire start in .
they locked by the au@@ dr@@ in tower .
but we were defeated
but they were in strange .
give me your word ..
why do you care ?
from the fury of the north@@ men , release us .
we shall meet there , my friend
take as many weapons as you can carry .
follow me .
clever .
we have to know who our enemies are .
jor@@ und , are you really that stupid ?
but any his enemies certainly will .
the king dun@@ ch@@ aid still has a forti@@ fications .
not even your great army was able too .
with boats , as in painting .
who is say not led us into a trap ?
i say we have no other option but to accept his help .
he is a christian , you should think again .
if he wanted us dead , we has opportunity enough .
the peaks are useful for climbing and hunting
and it is there that the bas@@ ques are in openings in the cliff .
and the openings will be flooded in to springs .
one moment . what 's in it for you , monk ?
one day , i was ordered to the
but not only was able to win their trust .
without bloodshed .
you mean , men like you ?
after all the defe@@ ats , he fled with us .
just like you .
do not worry , my heart is not broken .
this explains why you locked in the wagon .
take the shirt off , or i 'll cut it off .
that does it for you ? all right .
f '@@ aster . come on .
no , no , no . back down .
you@@ l 're ador@@ able .
dude !
why would you post that ?
val , i didn 't know you were so much fun .
okay , seriously , i 'm friends with my mom on here .
come on !
he 's been listening this whole time .
yeah , me neither .
let 's just hang up .
come over , adam , and we ' go see , uh ..
just play the stupid game .
what the fuck are you doing ?
it 's just three words . free live cam@@ s .
having beautiful women all over the internet
yes ! somewhere horrible ! somewhere corrupt !
unhappy , darling ?
oh , g@@ ome@@ z , you have torn down my walls
so i missed one practice . what 's the big deal ?
the sab@@ re maz@@ ur@@ ka is the most important day
it 's the day your entire family gathers around you
but swords are so old-fashioned .
son , our family hasn 't been all together in 13 years .
i just want it to go perfectly .
that 's my boy .
no ! no !
if i 'd known you were coming ,
you won 't even know i 'm here .
uncle ,
i heard a strange noise in the fog earlier ,
it has notes of oak , cherry , and yoga .
ah ! let me try that .
they have a wonderful gri@@ t !
this is where we all belong , yeah
it 's easy to be happy when you have no choice
well , then , we ought to do the same .
say it again until you believe it
g@@ ome@@ z , we should return home .
true , these people are a little different .
we have to give them a chance . get to know them .
" win them over " ?
marg@@ aux need@@ ler .
my wife , mor@@ ti@@ cia .
our children , wednesday , pu@@ g@@ sley .
you know , we can see right into your windows ?
as your neighbor , i 'd like to offer you
it will be a challenge ,
i should like to see what this plastic woman has to offer .
actually , ms. need@@ ler ..
stop by anytime you 'd like .
i 'll see you at your house , first thing tomorrow .
that woman seems der@@ an@@ ged .
yeah , that 's fine . i mean , no one would know .
okay , right by the printer .
i think this guy paraly@@ zed his own kid
i got this . why don 't you go be with your dad ?
what ? you must have questions .
help me get him to the o.@@ r. ,
he has a lot of internal bleeding ,
oh , my god .
he was moving .
so sit tight .
n@@ ope ! no .
like a train wreck .
um , what are you doing here ?
now is that a farm tradition ?
all right . i totally understand if you 're not .
that is none of your business !
he 's just hoo@@ king up with the best teacher
congratulations .
and you became the thing we laughed at .
i 'm sorry . i
you did your best , and ..
thanks .
we 're not family .
i p@@ aged you to get yang . yang is his doctor .
besides , i treated him .
i know what i 'm doing .
all this blood . where is it ? where is it ?
got it . i got my finger on it .
no . the per@@ f 's widening already .
2-@@ 0 silk .
the issue of ..
you will not be king .
you will not inherit this crown .
that privilege and responsibility
but it is my duty as king ,
when do you fight ?
we fight by week 's end .
these fe@@ u@@ ds need not be yours .
a bird ? a dead one , i should suppose .
un@@ natural mechanics from the edge of chri@@ sten@@ dom .
this belongs to my cousin , cambridge .
indeed i have known you longer than i have my own young sister .
so , i think it only fitting that you should have this magical bird .
from the dau@@ ph@@ in ,
there is no accompanying message from the dau@@ ph@@ in ?
i shall keep this gift .
for the boy i once was .
you must respond .
a new chapter of my life has begun before the last could be properly closed .
but the fact that this here be the first occasion
to steer our present course ,
i need men around me i can trust .
a king has no friends .
i 'm sorry my occasion to visit ...
the second ...
what did you say to me ?
how dare you defy me ?
don 't let it outside this tent .
and where is the fear@@ some old warrior fal@@ staff
i speak only when there 's something to be said .
i 'm not that man .
my li@@ ege .
si@@ res . what can i do for you ?
we are both out@@ numbered and out-@@ positioned .
that should be a tip in your inspir@@ ational book ,
the other really important thing i did today ...
now you can give one to peach
yeah , a connection to her babies ' asses .
plus , peach is interviewing this gay guy
just give her the cards . we have to start somewhere .
that 's pretty cool .
it 's real .
don 't say your real thoughts .
use my spa voice ? okay .
i want you to make sure the twins
all they drink is breast milk .
we 're all so tense about the birthday party .
um , peach , um ...
i don 't need it . like , i 'm fine .
like a ... like a ... favor .
i 'm sorry .
i have to go meet the martha stewart queen
well , that 's exactly how i envisioned that .
a rat with a civil war hat .
i did my part , so you better get this bed done .
i 'm so proud of you . what did she say ?
relax . the bed will be assembled
you called a guy ?
wait . you don 't know any guys .
johnny .
eh , i don 't want to see johnny .
i thought you guys were friends .
he was fake interviewing me with a cel@@ ery stalk ...
yeah , it 's hard for my people , too ,
but they did keep you warm , i bet ,
that 's southern belle .
no , i 'm still thinking about my balls .
that was weird , right ?
intense good or intense bad ?
who@@ o .
no , this is where i go to my al@@ read@@ y-@@ built bed .
whatever that was out there with my boo@@ b ,
go in !
what is happening out here ?
was that of feeling rich .
this should have alerted us .
there were hints all along ,
we were traveling light .
i was younger .
but the actions that we have been forced to take in that area ,
just the simple fact that she 's down there reporting on the conflict
mr. secretary , if i may disagree .
but he , and i , can assure you , as his chief foreign aid officer ,
obviously , we don 't want to compromise decision-making on our part
look , ber@@ qu@@ ist , please assure the senator that we 're working very hard
fine . that 's all .
mr. secretary , uh ...
mike 's paying .
beautiful day for some flag
who doesn 't love cheer@@ leaders and hank williams ?
sorry ?
different animal entirely .
well , when you put it like that ...
not every bull can be a lon@@ gh@@ orn , am i right ?

fine , go ahead .
my apologies . how can i help you today ?
great , trouble with girl@@ friends

a timber camp ?
unfortunately , it burned down and killed her whole family .
she was so covered in ash , they thought she was a ghost .

t ' walt until the office closes
there 's no shame in it . ia 's instinct .

very bad .
you totally stopped taking the pills , didn 't you ?
thanks for your honesty , jerry .
i 'm just gonna go to the bathroom .
okay , i 'll be right back .
i 'll .. i 'll stop them .
they already know . i told them .
i told them that sometimes i can hear
the angels talking to me .
i know you do , jerry .
i told them and they won 't let me alone .
promise .
i 'm really glad you asked me out .
you 're so mysterious , you know .
hmm .
what 's on your mind ?
definitely .
i know . i gotta go home and feed my cat and dog

a lot of the time .
our father , who art in heaven , hal@@ lowed be thy name ,
amen
i can 't reach her , either .
no email , no facebook updates .
i liked all of them and i wish they were all alive .
do you have packing tape ?
because i can 't let you go and i still need a lot of therapy .
back ! back !
let 's discuss this
oh , a lot of people hear voices .
a lot of people ?
it might be a voice telling them
drink that drink , take that drug ,
not exactly the same as you ,
but none of chat 's true .
well , i can 't shut them off entirely ...
but i can argue against them .
hey .
it 's not your fault
put me the fuck down , you god@@ damn psych@@ o .
the suspect 's car is in the parking lot .
i want you two on the right .
all right , keep low , guys .
is this your brilliant escape plan , jerry ?
it 's your favorite door , isn 't it ?
so because of my husband 's disability ,
i can 't believe it 's still available .
this time , use a little elbow grease .
enough for my taste .
oh , it sounds like he 's leaving .
maybe i should go apologize .
ida 's cat got out again .
i hope you find him .
wait . hold on . i have to fix this .
oh , she was calm .
no you 're missing my point .
my kid than there are for yours .
poo@@ girl has been through .
her mom was kind of a psych@@ o .
i am just saving , apple ... tree .
and i 'm just saying , my daughter is fine .
or@@ son , what are you doing here ?
the key is the sleep@@ walking .
i was sleep@@ walking when i drove the car .
i saw you take money from one of ' em .
all right .
i do tat@@ to@@ os .
hers are for grow@@ n-@@ ups and they sell .
what 's this about ?
america with a law degree ,
we have our problems like anyone else .
you guys live one day at a time ?
so fragile right now ,
i get it . you did that once before .
wasn 't it , though ?
i made that play for your cousin .
anyway , i lied about every bit of it .
i know .
this , but , uh ... he 's a good guy .
which cousin ?
where is she ? !
she only uses the place in the winter , so ..
and that 's de@@ b .
uh , no , just medical school .
god , good for her .
sand , sun , chees@@ y matching out@@ fits .
whom you 're interrog@@ ating right now , right ?
lincoln , the point of this action
aren 't you leaving something out ,
let 's talk about thinking too much , okay ?
yesterday he found us on interstate 10 .
and " ms " are your initi@@ als .
he 's been here three days
well , and from what i 've gathered ,
beng@@ ali has 14 different vo@@ wels .
lincoln got away .
i have .
do you have anything ?
i 'm sorry , michael .
so , the guy who was posing as a cop
and if he was following
at least she didn 't want us killed .
har@@ k , what was that ? one more time ?
we need to move now .
self ready to go , t-@@ bag ?
just run your mouth .
look , when we get in , we 'll let you know .
i don 't know about that .
excuse me ?
uh .. could you notify him i 'm here ? thank you .
she lives in kashmir .
that explains a lot , don 't it ? listen ,
naturally ,
this is all very sudden .
i will just say one more thing ...
what do you think your father
and don 't worry about san@@ din@@ sky .
move an inch
you honor your side of the agreement
i need your beijing report for the foreign office .
yeah , on it .
" that means a q@@ rc surge effort to revive / create efforts
are the yan@@ ks really asking us to dig up
" this effort will probably peak in the middle of next week
excuse me . question .
uh , this n@@ sa mem@@ o , our people approved it ?
the americans want us to help
it 's a joint uk / usa operation .
what is the status , in your view , of any second resolution ?
just let me reiterate what i just said .
any attempt to drag the process on for months
no , no , this is important .
come on , there are no credible links
i don 't know , a journalist ,
at least my conscience is clear .
we have a right to intervene in the balkans .
iraq 's a little more complicated .
oh , fuck son@@ ny and cher !
milo@@ se@@ vic bad . saddam bad .
and yet colin powell presented
really ?
whose product is he then ?
so why don 't you tell your journalists
okay , what if i had evidence that the n@@ sa
you tell me .
you know , martin , i believe that all information
but in this case , i don 't have the luxury of time , admiral .
yes , i see .
... not on whether a news report
ed , it 's edi@@ e from the london office .
he said you should call extension 67@@ 27 .
67@@ 27 . good luck .
what am i supposed to do ?
if you say nothing , they can never prove anything .
they 're interrog@@ ating my friends .
that will be over soon .
there will be a question mark
i have to prove it was real .
nobody cares !
if i don 't say it was me , then we 'll go to war
c@@ live pon@@ ting
so since ' 89 , the public interest is
i have to think about it .
i promised anne a weekend away .
but she 's young and principled .
you sure he was following you ?
sometimes men stare ...
what kind of a stare was it ?
i work at g@@ ch@@ q .
you 've never seen war ! you 've never sm@@ elled it !
you should see if they 're looking for extr@@ as .
l can 't have a beer now ?
addy , you want to try it ?
and i sure as hell am not doing it , so .
oh , okay . good .
howard 's gonna stop by , we 're gonna play
i prefer the classics : regular and k@@ ling@@ on .
just f@@ yi ,
you went out in the hall@@ way .
if it 'll make you feel better , we rarely listen .
yeah , sure .
so you 're probably wondering what that was all about .
nah , women do that to me all the time .
what ? why ?
you 're a scientist who went to college
just guys .
why can 't you get back together with leonard ?
really ?
so , leonard , i 'm taking your gal out
right , leonard ?
but i 'm gonna blow that off to spend the evening
what kind of spac@@ eship has a hole in the middle ?
knoc@@ k-@@ knock .
come on in .

he 's hoping to see ep@@ sil@@ on er@@ id@@ ani dim , which would be
i did it with you when we rented the note book .
you 'd better open up that bottle of wine
i can 't be drinking , i 'm about to make
how do you know that ?
maybe i could go in a little late .
your career is far too important .
bern@@ ade@@ tte , please tell your boyfriend
once he finds a joke he likes , he sticks with it .
like his hair@@ cut material .
" no . i got them all cut . "
right . " help , i 'm a prisoner
" howard , come rub my feet !
i bring this up , because , in 140 years ,
he is still afraid ,
i would encourage everyone who is watching ,
i thought i thought this out .
the key is they 're back there ,
yeah , especially since we don 't have a pot to p@@ iss in
you 're not being very transparent , warden .
maybe you should ,
right now . mr. mah@@ one ,
either she fights and lives , or she qu@@ its and dies .
do whatever thing you got to do , man .
you don 't care that someone 's going to be executed for your murder
who did ? your sister , the president ?
i 'm a prisoner to all of this .
you could have come forward .
everything we need .
storage .
he brought the entire thing in ,
i knew the guy was an engineer or whatever ,
uh , he was cool you know .
everything had to be perfect ,
we have your number right ?
i see that you have a mrs. gu@@ d@@ at out there .
fine .
story of my life .

it 's all here isn 't it ?
ripe chance woods .

captain , manager says
oh , je@@ ez ...
come on , kate ! i 'm waiting !
he sho@@ ved me against the wall , into this picture .
i want for the two of you to get along .
te@@ ddy , please put the tree back up .
come on , you guys ! dad would 've had this place looking ...
this does not look like a christmas tree . it looks like ...
wh@@ oa , wh@@ oa ! you want some coo@@ kie with those sprink@@ les ?
dad likes sprink@@ les .
sometimes i forget .
she 's our friend and she 's crazy !
no , no , no , no . te@@ ddy , te@@ ddy , i don 't think this is such a good idea .
oh , come on ! do you wanna save christmas ?
uh , that kin@@ da undermines the whole naughty or nice concept , don 't you think ?
i mean , technically , that 's illegal , too .
and , plus , it 's not just any car .
i mean , we 're not even breaking the law because ..
i mean , i 'm used to something with more pop under the hood ,
i 'm santa claus , te@@ ddy , not yo@@ da .
what he does . i ...
low@@ ell .
let me get this straight . you broke into this boy 's residence
santa !
i know , i know .
now we 're gonna see what you 're made of !
and go !
some things we gotta figure out on our own , te@@ ddy .
all right , here 's the book with all the names and addresses .
ignore him ,
you know , when they told him he won ,
who list@@ ens to the radio anymore ?
they say it could be a potential indicator
isn 't he an indicator of life on other planets ?
now everything is bert , bert , bert !
you want me to read a geology paper ?
you busy ?
who is it ?
i found him in an old box .
i didn 't buy it .
last question .
what 's the big deal ?
no , it 's not . check it out .
hey good loo@@ kin ' .
his eyes also light up in the dark .
no , i went to punch the water fountain ,
if 's not hard . just picture the three sto@@ o@@ ges ,
jealousy is completely il@@ logical .
everyone gets jealous .
what about me and shel@@ don ?
i 've always been jealous of how much money
i 've been envi@@ ous of her looks .
i thought it was brave .
you know , how come nobody 's talking about
and i think you 're cute .
i think i hate all of you ner@@ ds .
oh , i don 't mind .
well , change " plaque " to " mix@@ ed-@@ race couple "
bert . bert . bert !
all right , let 's do this ..
we need to talk .
rock , rock , water fountain .
but i have been envi@@ ous of your recent success .
once i get la@@ si@@ k , i 'll be out of things to wish for .
hey , boss lady ,
yeah , i went there !
well , if he 's handling han 's hose ,
i 'll show you what this puppy can do .
a little help .
damn ! that 's hot .
well , i better go dry off in the men 's room .
i 've got a date with the land o '@@ lakes butter package lady
max ? are you seeing what i 'm seeing ?
we might not be able to get n@@ ash fired ,
he could be the future bul@@ ge of cal@@ vin klein .
why can 't you just accept that we are stuck
not me , ' cause i 'm past that .
i think i just sat another one of those
why do you think i got out of pim@@ ping ?
so , did you get n@@ ash a modeling job yet ?
it 's not like i can just call ty@@ ra banks .
u@@ gh , phone therapy ran long .

it 's her , her , and her .
i have a movie that starts shooting tomorrow
it 's the lead in so@@ rest r@@ ump .
should i come with you ?
i have a couple of questions for the actor .
max , this has gone too far .
also , what does " gay for pay " mean ?
look at him , max .
n@@ ash doesn 't care about modeling .
his biggest concern is playing with the x@@ box .
he cares about you .

i 'm meeting someone here and my phone 's about to die .
do you have an outlet ?
like , right into the water .
i 'll plug you in , honey .

you know how much i love lady tail .
isn 't it amazing ?
you can feel his anger in the walls .
i mean , it 's not only me . nobody can stand her .
okay , well , on that note ...
and then they learn to talk .
oh , you .
i guess that 's a " no " on phy@@ ll@@ is ?
why not ?
they didn 't lose their daughter , mia .
by now she 's probably got three husbands and calls herself " star . "
no . why would t ?
they call themselves " the family . "
the two are believed to be members of a cult
one officer summed up these blood-@@ soaked murders by saying
which is why ...
f you do so delic@@ ately .
yes , sir . thank you .
you 're on bed rest for a while . you 'd go crazy if i didn 't .
you know i can 't stand them .
okay ? we can turn the whole room into your own little swe@@ at@@ shop .
you think the baby 's okay ?
oh , really ? because i heard there 's some new research that , um , you know ..
i love you .
i realize , miss pren@@ tice , but you still have time . mind if i look around ?
i do know how painful this must be for you .
look , i don 't even want to talk about it . i don 't wanna think about it . i ...
what if they 're not dead ? what 'll you do then ?
help me !
excuse me .
may be lea@@ h will like it too , when she 's a little older .
well , feel free to stop by anytime .
hey .
see ! tha ' s us .
so we turned to the church , ta@@ ther .
and it worked for them .
but you two hit more than just a rough patch .
and it made them see and do all sorts of
have you ever heard the expression :
and one more thing . does the cult have a name ?
is there anything i can help you with ?
i just learned something
and if it does , i 'm too tired to show it .
or we just .. i think my family 's being haunted by a ghost .
how do we stop it from coming back ?
but someone at the church might .
what do we do in the meantime ?
jet me take her .
it will weaken the demon enough , it won 't have the strength to return .
of course .
oh , no . no , john . i can 't . not until i know it 's not coming back .
what if i just stayed up with her ?
okay .
john .
he@@ h . you are going to spoil her .
oh , i don 't know if that is true .
oh , e@@ vel@@ yn .
oh , mommy .
put her down here .
what was it that you were hum@@ ming ?
it was the only thing that would settle my ruby down when she was a baby .
if you don 't wanna talk about it , it 's fine .
they live up north .
family will do that to you .
last thing i remember was .
i woke up three weeks later ...
i didn 't get a chance to say goodbye .
i made the mistake .

hang on , ra@@ e .
i 'm just doing my job , alan .

i thought this is what you wanted to do .

i forgot to punch out .
we 're joined by thomas wayne .
he has a personal connection
they 're asking him about those horrible subway murders .
at least grab a ti@@ tty or something !
why can 't i control it ?
to lure its prey , to take its place .
what do these last words mean ?
what does it mean ?
maybe he felt that in order to survive ,
i think it 's a metaphor .
oh , someone help me , i 've been
scary enough for her .
what are you waiting for ?
okay , so call me what you want then
look , dawn 's the only name
dawn , it 's nice to meet you .
how you doing , boy ?

a drink for the lady ?
allow me to introduce myself .

stay focused .
clean up after yourself , will ya ?
i could ask you the same .
you don 't fully understand if you 're not careful .
is this more real than anything else out there ?
sure doesn 't seem that way sometimes .
why can 't you stay here all the time ?
could he be this dumb , or is he really different ?
i 'm only here for this .
what aren 't you telling me ?
i 'm highly capable of being by myself .
so what do you wanna do ?
now that makes everything
can 't be here .
there 's no time
may very well be your daughter .
i fear in a not very pleasant affair .
i can tell you what i know .
now you gotta trust all your senses
now close your eyes .
i see .
all right , close your eyes .
we bring you ab rats and you
like i told your traveling fre@@ ak show before ,
if fear is the catalyst you seek ,
this is about the survival of man kind
they say that her pack travel in swar@@ ms
each fiber of their being using their
the girl , the girl 's here .
there 's something else .
you have so much in you you can 't see .
i don 't know what to do .
why do you people always feel
all you need to understand is that
something you 'll never fully comprehend .
you 're just a silly boy .
just do everybody a favor and leave
this is living .
let 's do it , man .
you know , i know we haven 't talked much ,
man , that 's why i 'm here , dude .
eating fun@@ nel cakes and having

staying in bed all day ?
you have to get back to your desk .

the dean 's party .
it 's the least i can do for you .
we 'll be out before semester break .
i don 't understand . you ... first , you want to go .
i don 't like the way he talks to you
what ?
the way she talks to you , your secret looks .
women like shirley don 't have friends .
yeah . yeah . we 're all big fans of your husband .
maybe try out on the porch .
you don 't have to go , darling
you will
he says you have nothing to worry about .
good job , miles .
please stop . i don 't want to go .
see , this is where everything goes wrong : when we talk .
hey , i went out with this guy t@@ j for eight months ,
he 's got to be doing this on purpose .
you and penny decide to go out and paint the town bei@@ ge ?
i guess it didn 't go well .
not to a certainty .
how about now ?
for all we know , he 's being murdered .
you were in the middle of an erection .
what does she want from me now ?
it 's about a poor immigrant from pakistan
needy baby , greedy baby indeed .
he 's looking for a different parking space .
we were next to a car
me , too .
you have a keen insight into the human heart ,
i just ..
you didn 't know it was me and you were hitting on me ?
i pretty much thought you were , you know , just some blonde .
and you are no blonde .
blon@@ des are either bad@@ ass or fun .
damn .
quit staring . i 'm probably gonna change it back anyway .
you get dumped by your boyfriend ,
i didn 't get dumped . okay ?
it 's valentine 's day , and i wanted to change something .
hey , hold the elevator .
trauma 4 is open .
where are they taking my husband ?
his doctors will let us know more soon .
what do you have , grey ?

i 'm sorry .
looks like a pretty bad break .
i wonder if there 's any chance
of course . forgive me .
i know how it works .
i , um , am not sure i 'm going .
you have to cause you 're his wife .
when did you get in ? does mark know you 're here ?
somebody said that you guys have a free clinic ?
is everything okay ?
after the surgery and everything .
yeah , the clinic closed an hour ago .
i 'll take a pe@@ ek for you .
i 'm not too big on talking to people , and ...
they just , you know , bring me the dishes .
i don 't want to have one arm .
i-i don 't like people staring at me .
please .
it 's a little too intense for a first date , though .
isn 't there a dying child somewhere ?
baby looks perfect .
um , can i , like , get that in writing ?
here is a souvenir .
why do you need an official form ?
if you want your official form , it is , slo@@ an .
it 's for the adoption attorney , okay ?
there 's this great couple in san francisco ,
no . an@@ d. you 're my doctor , right ?
well , i 'm not gonna tell him , and neither are you .
she gets chil@@ led easily .
well , i can see why she comes in every week .
when she first started coming in , before they met ,
she was adventu@@ rous ...
when she 'd gone through the menu ,
she became ... my favorite part of the week .
she felt like this was a safe place for a first date .
the night he proposed to her ..
the slo@@ an nose .
he 's been staring at her from his kitchen for 15 years .
he just did . she was awake the whole time .
and they look like they 're smart .
they expected nothing from me .. ever .
so i had to push myself ...
i didn 't even tell ' em i was taking the m@@ cat 's
okay , you want to be un@@ forget@@ table ?
yes . yes , we can .
o@@ oh , thank god . where 'd you get those ?
he 's not gonna miss ' em .
he 's still asleep ,
e@@ w . these are all half-@@ eaten .
what are we doing ?
this dude 's been in love with her for 15 years .
i mean , is this what marriage turns into ,
yeah .
i 'm a surgeon .
i didn 't do that either .
you should 've .
she 's gonna wake him up .
she can 't breathe . get a crash cart .
what 's happening ?
okay . she 's having trouble breathing .
we saved the arm . we saved it .
it 's gonna have to be an ampu@@ tation .
i 've never done one .
so ? after today , you can 't say that anymore .

grey . a@@ very get ready to scru@@ b in .
okay , that ?
i wanted to get it out of my system ,
i didn 't take one home .
let me see . what else ?
my best friend who i could tell everything to .
yeah , ' cause you said you love me .
and then you chose yang .
i feel like i 'm cheating on her .
so i 'm sorry .
don 't you have something else to do ?
last week , i would 've been p@@ aged in to help .
push another atro@@ pine . damn it .
damn it . come on .
i-i shouldn 't have come back .
listen ..
i almost walked away .
if they don 't hurt you
i don 't get to pick it .
oh . if i had one , it would be " brown dynam@@ ite . "
are you not looking at me ?
you have to take me to the dentist at 4 : 00 .
of course i can . it 's coming back ,
they put you under for a cleaning ?
it 's ridiculous .
you know , i had better things to do yesterday
i don 't care . i 'm done .
i got pretty exciting nasa news today .

open the pod bay doors , hal .
and dr. ho@@ f@@ stad@@ ter .
my apologies .

i 'm right in the middle of my addiction study .
oh , where 'd the magic go ?
absolutely .

uh , dentist .
um , well , who wants to take me wednesday morning
oh . that one had ho@@ ot written all over it .
i 'm sorry , you want me to take you to the dentist ?
shel@@ don , i 'm working .
maybe there 's a way to get them to come up with it .
once i tried carrying around a duncan yo@@ -@@ yo ,
no , they ended up calling me so@@ ck mouth .
okay , uh , what if we make " rocket man " your ring@@ tone ,
that 's actually not a terrible plan .
'@@ su@@ p ?
not necessary . no .
.. the fellow on the phone seemed to have an open mind .
are you suggesting that you 've come to your senses
o@@ oh , so@@ ck mouth 's got him on the ropes .
and now if you 'll excuse me ,
why is that good ?
power failure .
and to not having to watch shel@@ don demonstrate
boy , was she wrong .
i thought because our relationship 's in a beta test ,
do you want to make out slow ?
since when don 't you knock ?
social nic@@ eties have been suspended , leonard .
the world has descended into dark@@ ened turmoil .
funny you should talk about stuff that 's missing .
pictures ?
i know that mike 's been having troubles with his memory .
being a model must be so amazing .
well , l fell in love ,
so you going back to modeling ?
why not ?
you 're going back to modeling ? this is so sudden .
i 'm just gonna fly to new york , meet with my old agent and take it from there .
oh , we are . we 're just gonna miss you , that 's all .
i have this hole in my life that can 't be filled by shopping .
oh , my go@@ sh . ly@@ net@@ te .
i 'm starting my cards early this year .
and with the pack of lies in this family newsletter , she spreads holiday denial .
well said , darling .
wait , if we hated the restaurant , then why are we bringing home food ?
wait , wait , wait , wait ! are you kidding ? !
okay , i thought the restaurant was fantastic ,
yeah . yeah , it 's just that ..
it will . give it time .
hey , the worst is behind you .
edi@@ e brit@@ t , wanna talk to you .
haven 't i suffered enough for one week ?
look , don 't like it either , but the harder we try to keep them apart ,
well , l guess you 're all set then .
i want to be buried in this dress !
the " mom " stuff is at the end .
okay , lu@@ v , let 's get the blood pumping !
okay ? get to work , everybody .
lovely to see you again .
i do .
i mean , it 's a little confusing .
see that guy , and they 're gonna wonder who i am .
people aren 't gonna buy that , so here 's what i was thinking .
and we 're gonna cra@@ m all that on a sub@@ title , are we ?
just make it work .
before we begin , would either of you like some cookies , milk , lem@@ on@@ ade , perhaps ?
ah , cutting to the chase . i like it .
this whole dating drama has been keeping me up at night ,
search warrant ? let me see that .
we couldn 't find o tool@@ box .
sir , l can 't find a thing .
well you 're 30 now .
do you know how many photographers would die to work with me again ?
sorry i 'm late . mr@@ s.@@ pres@@ cott broke a crown and .
a word , darling ?
what gives it that kick ?
you 've barely touched your salmon , dear .
yes .
i want us to be friends .
i should have smo@@ thered you in your cri@@ b when i have the chance .
that 's the mother i remember !
you were due .
you 've always trusted my judgment .
relationships have nothing to do with good judgment .
you can still get hurt .
okay .
gl@@ oria , stop !
not that it 's any of my business , but , is everything okay with you folks ?
oh , what the hell ?
just for a few weeks till we find a place where she 'll be happier .
she 's absolutely miserable in that nursing home .
my mother 's not moving in here till she fits in a jar on the mantle .
you don 't know who she is .
why ?
old man !
it 's time for your tribute .
you asked how long i put myself into something ?
and is that an order you still want to belong to
being a squ@@ ire was hard ,
i won 't be poor anymore .
the heavens weep !
oh , it 's a sign .
of what ?
tell the gate to double the watch .
my father used to mine soil and rocks , and sometimes , he said ...
he said sometimes ,
it is north of the wa
but i bet there 's gold
i wish you good fortune .
i would have passed him this necklace
sh@@ h !
you 'll eat your words when i 'm back with a full purse
save your arrows .
i was an appren@@ tice with the white circle
that sor@@ cere@@ r ?
yes . and they 're very valuable .
but save your strength .
m on no one 's side but my own .
and can you blame me ?
let 's get started .
like a thor@@ ny vine .
i can 't blame you for feeling protective .
come now ,
aye , a man be a man ,
the other side is inside . this is outside .
like animals in a cage .
you like her too .
each day , our bond grows closer .
but now i can feel how your heart races when she 's near you .
of course my heart 's racing .
the fools have forgotten their l@@ add@@ ers .
they 're waiting for the moon !
that old rhy@@ me ?
it 's more than you ever taught me
my blade shall defend the helpless .
the old codes have been bought and sold .
aim for their front line
more like 91 degrees .
doesn 't rule out a natural .
i guess we should get to work .
garden@@ er found the body .
so the cycle takes a back@@ seat ,
actually , there is .
like chess players , they want to review their moves
i 'll look through them , see if i can find a recording
yeah , i don 't need a forensics lesson there . mr. wizard .
i 'm not putting it in the bag , i 'm putting it on the bag .
whatever .
you 're the fel@@ la who crossed swords with nate has@@ k@@ ell .
cool .
now !
i 'm getting sick to my stomach with your cra@@ p .
what was that ?
that explains it .
all signs of bl@@ un@@ t-@@ force trauma .
it was a single g@@ sw to the back of the head .
it 's probably still holding .
thanks ..
so mr. fow@@ ler interrup@@ ts a burgl@@ ary .
the killer pun@@ ches him , ties him up .
what do you think , new girlfriend ?
he 's still wearing his wedding ring .
well , it 's aer@@ on 's legion .
the point is , you 've got all these weapons ,
greg .
one player pulled a radical move
a move like that
unless the point is to give your opponent a seizure .
it 's not just me , man .
yeah , well , for the record , i am not among them .
you might as well just give it to me right now .
yeah , yeah , okay . what 's up with this guy ?
they were friends , before the divorce .
yes , i do .
when was the last time you saw ben ?
i took him back to the house .
i just poured you a glass of wine .
i 'm tired . i don 't want to do this anymore .
ah , shoot !
you know what , next time , just call somebody else .
sounds like he was in a pretty dark place .
he lost his contracting business .
started drinking , gambling .
i filed , he left .
i just wish i could take back what i said .
why didn 't you find the bullet the first time ?
are you questioning my work ?
relax .
a gam@@ er on z@@ ol@@ pi@@ dem ? !
yeah . listen , thanks to you guys ,
so nin@@ ja@@ assass@@ in 's off the hook .
maybe someone spi@@ ked his joy@@ stick .
what about his stomach contents ?
what ?
i didn 't crush any pills .
he had trouble sleeping .
i 'm gonna score and then i 'm gonna score .
parame@@ dic@@ s found her on the stairs .
hey , bank . hope you got my stomach contents there .
i can 't believe i got ro@@ ped into being everybody 's boo@@ kie .
adds in some special sauce .
i buy it .
well , we still have her bottle of z@@ ol@@ pi@@ dem .
i 'll go get it .
if she served him his last meal ,
sorry . i had to .
oh , just our prime suspect .
the man liked to eat .
hey , listen , i love pizza , you know ?
i like it , you know , ili@@ ke new york style pizza .
is it valuable ?
we 'll see what we get .
this case will just not die a natural death .
doc rob@@ bins found rope fibers in the victim 's teeth .
so he wasn 't trying to loo@@ sen his restraints
and when he fired the gun underwater ,
because he wanted to make amends .
he 's divorced , he 'd gotten pulled over for a du@@ i .
that couldn 't have felt good .
and while he 's watching carl and his thu@@ gs
okay .
well , i think we 're good to go .
i kind of want to see how the kid 's mom comes out .
uh ... the cardi@@ o doc .
did you see that woman ?
why do you guys call it that ?
anyway , i 'm not doing a marathon anytime soon ,
yeah , until now .
there are guys at the intersection selling flowers .
i mean , they couldn 't make it any easier .
i mean , tomorrow is our 15th wedding anniversary
you 're doing it extra hard tonight .
no fan necessary . we 'll c@@ rank the ac , ba@@ be .
that is the qu@@ ince dag@@ ger .
a gift to the family from marco polo ,
nick 's grandmother gave us a to@@ aster from se@@ ars .
oh , look . here comes daddy .
captain wong ,
my friends ,
you will find , as you get older ,
who ... you 've failed .
grace , who shines so brightly on the silver screen .
my friend , the colonel , who 's kept me safe these many years .
and my to@@ bias .
my boy .
i have thought long and hard about what each of you is truly worth ,
you 're wonderful . you look extravag@@ ant tonight .
we have to preserve the crime scene .
yes , of course .
suspects ?
wong , when you finish locking up here , you bring me the key .
in the meantime , i 'm gonna check the shrimp out a little closer .
no , wong , because i 'm hungry as shit .
i will now summon you one by one to the grand lounge for questioning .
oh , you broke it . you broke it .
he was the most wonderful ... .
he was the love of my life .
describe to me what happened .
lights went out .
yes . finish line .
i di .. hey !
hey , okay .
i love you .
you wish me to believe you 're innocent .
but i 'm telling you the truth .
excuse me ?
failed his detective 's exam three times .
so i ... tell people i 'm a detective .
what . what is he talking about ?
nick spit@@ z@@ . is many things , but not a detective .
i will repeat this message in spanish .
i didn 't . i didn 't lie .
we are on our way to qu@@ ince 's villa right now .
i 'm sorry , i wasn 't prepared for you to actually answer that .
you meet us at the villa , we will reveal the killer .
which , en fran@@ ca@@ is , roughly translates to le@@ bou@@ til@@ lier .
this is a joke .
fine ! then to@@ bey killed him , but he did it with a little help .
you convinced to@@ bey to kill mal@@ col@@ m so you could split the money with him .
then me and this girl started asking too many questions .
luckily , not for him , but sergei gets in the way .
i don 't care what happens to me anymore , okay ?
i just wanted to take one of them down with me .
he 's also being arra@@ ign@@ ed for the murder of his mother and his step@@ father .
exactly .
right now , his only shot is if we can get him tried as a minor .
i need to sell to the court that he was just a scared kid .
'@@ he 'll listen to me . i need to see him .
he gets tried as an adult , he may as well sit in my lap in the chair .
i can still do my job .
we make that call .
there are actually higher agendas here .
paul k@@ ell@@ er@@ man no longer works for the secret service .
have i made myself clear ?
i need you to focus .
there we go .
yes . it is a path .
so , what 's up , man ?
all your outstanding markers , they 're mine now .
okay , so that 's what this is all about .
well , you know what , man ?
no . we don 't got that .
look , we are gonna have to find another way to get that money , okay ?
a , i 'm not d.@@ b. cooper , and , b , there 's no vis@@ itation today .
i guess that only leaves us with one real option .
gambling ? and that 's your solution ?
when i play cards , it ain 't gambling .
so why are you just bringing this up now ?
go get our money , boy .
oh , hell , no .
look , all you need to know is this ,
but if you 're the one ra@@ king in all the cash ,
where 's your girl ?
filing a petition down at the courts .
see , that was easy .
why don 't you just take a step back ?
you need to keep an eye on ver@@ onica don@@ o@@ van .
that 's how we 'll get out .
but three days after i 'm gone .
you 're just telling me what i want to hear .
i need you to let me get us out of here .
if you try to screw me over again i 'll kill you .
hi . how did it go ?
getting it approved , that 's a whole ' no@@ ther story .
warden .
somehow , your lawyer 's petition went through .
i 've never seen one of these granted before , ever .
i 'll make the travel arrangements ,
i don 't want any problems .
i 'll bet all i got .
i 'm in .
i said i only got $ 82 left .
you never heard of a gentleman 's game ?
you want to borrow some money ? ask your boys .
you want welfare , you 'd better vote democrat .
did he say he 's trying , or that he already got the blan@@ ks filled in ?
okay . now you gotta tell him that i filled in the hole .
i saw sco@@ field 's back .
i don 't know what you 're doing but i have an idea , huh ?
i think we can work something out .
no one 's getting out of here if maintenance goes to replacing sco@@ field 's toilet .
what 'd you say , slim ?
who the hell said we had a problem ?
lincoln and su@@ cre told me everything .
exactly , what did they tell you ?

passing the torch .
yeah , i married his son neil . we had one daughter , me@@ g .
and you remained close to the thro@@ mbe@@ ys .
i feel simultaneously freed by
sorry , the nu@@ g@@ get of .. : ?
did he get " into it " at the party ?
come one , dad !
i didn 't hear what he said , but he must 've really handed him his lunch .
you 're just dumping that bag of weak sauce on it .
all three of them did .
walter .
har@@ lan had turned walter down before regarding film rights .
now , we look at the pattern . har@@ lan was cleaning house .
did he plan to fire walter ?
yeah , please just wait inside , stay close , all right ?
and yes . you are right .
oh my god !

hugh dry@@ sd@@ ale ?
only the help call me hugh .
we just wanna ask a few questions .
we 're officers of the law .
hey ben@@ ny , you wanna ask this guy some questions ?
mr. dry@@ sd@@ ale .
hey fran@@ nie , how about a glass of cold milk ?
and i know that 's what grandfather was trying to protect me from by doing this ,
after i left the party , though , i was driving
like from here on out i was gonna have to f@@ end for myself .
good .
mar@@ ta i know three things . one : i know he didn 't commit suicide .
i don 't think it . i know it .
and he wanted it for you .
what 's going on ? this isn 't you .
because fuck my family .
you 're gonna give me my cut of the inheritance .
yeah .
me@@ g .
mar@@ ta get your ass up , what the hell is happening ? there 's a guy here and a bunch of stuff .
maybe , alice , i don 't know .
we don 't know much about mar@@ ta cab@@ rera or her exact relationship ...
i haven 't checked my email .
that 's it . 1@@ 209 columbus road , 10 am .
if you destroy that copy you are totally in the clear .
mar@@ ta , did you hear me ?
elli@@ ott ! we gotta go ! we gotta go !
oh god ! you regret helping me yet ?
anyway this will tie everything up .
god , you 're not much of a detective , are you ?
you make a pretty l@@ ousy murderer .
you 've always been good to me .
but i thought after what you 've gone through the last few days ,
excuse me !
you have all treated her like shit to steal back a fortune
nose all be@@ ak 's bloody .
ms. cab@@ rera has decided definitively not to renounce the inheritance .
furthermore , it will be my professional recommendation to the local authorities
indulge me .
yes , you did . yes , he did . yes , you are , but . but .
and what you and har@@ lan did that fat@@ eful night seems at first glance
but we must look a little closer .
it is not a don@@ ut hole , but a smaller don@@ ut with its own hole ,
why was i hired ? why would someone hire me ?
i was hired before the sealed will was read .
you can 't be serious !
mar@@ ta , remind me what ransom said his conversation with har@@ lan ended with .
well , vo@@ ila !
so , why did she send it to me ?
and when mr. dry@@ sd@@ ale gets it , what is his reaction ?
and then ...
and everything turns on its head .
the changed will is gonna stand . he has lost .
unless you decide .
it doesn ' count
this is another bird and food tra@@ pping resource .
that 's an application for hum@@ ming@@ bird trap .
two tier explosion .
a second bomb .
second one goes off here .
i don 't think some of them use any rule book when we hijacked fe@@ eta .
she maybe be able to sway some of the loy@@ alists .
this isn 't like the rest of pan@@ em
we need to control the arsenal inside that fortress .
that 's the same fac@@ ile thinking that led you to divert
if the moc@@ kin@@ gi@@ ay was gone ,
i 'm afraid that is not what we were to@@ asting at all .
i mean , it 's everybody 's job to keep you alive .
partly .
the whole tack@@ y romance drama and the defend@@ er-@@ of-the-@@ helpless act .
which makes you even more unbearable .
you should have been the moc@@ king@@ jay nobody has to tell you what to say .
you 're free
the last the rebels saw me i was lying on the ground .
we will shoot more pro@@ pos right here in 13 .
i should be with the troops .
as far as the soldiers know you survived a bullet to the heart .
when we win this war we 'll fly you in for the surrender .
i 'll do whatever you need me to do .
put her in the rotation .
especially with all this going on@@ .it 's going to set him off .
why would coin do this ?
they promised a free election .
nobody would think that i 'd be a leader .
if your immediate answer isn 't yes then you are dangerous .
only one thing you could do now to add more fire to this rebellion .
we 've been here before , you know ?
that look
i never wanted to kill you .
i saw with my own eyes .
after that , i saw you ...
hey , we better move .
those surveillance cameras caught us .
this is a bad spot . we need to move , now .
i can 't get a signal .
bo@@ g@@ 2@@ s gave it to me .
he did .
i saw him .
i 'm on special orders from coin .
let 's not lose our heads here
was she valuable ? she was extremely valuable to your rebellion .
you call themselves an alliance ,
yeah , that doesn 't even show the new ones .
and the red tops suggest to that .
my brother knows these tunnels really well .
they changed them .
like the .. little ones that they changed , they have this .
you should get some rest .
they mean that our lives were never ours .
cur lives , belong to snow and our deaths do too .
if you end all of this ...
s@@ alla .
she can 't lose you .
the way she kissed you in the quarter qu@@ ell .
no , you won her over .
it 's not going to be an issue much longer .
and if we do , then ...
yeah
sun 's coming up .
i have an announcement .
interim ?
we have no way of knowing for certain .
we 'll plan an election when the time is right .
a symbolic vote .
hundreds of his accomplices also await their deaths .
i know you 'll never escape it .
we 're in that sweet period where everyone agrees
although who knows ? maybe this time we 'll learn .
it 's better for you to be out of sight .
and i hope you can find your@@ s.@@ plu@@ tar@@ ch .
home . we go home .
it 's your job to take care of yourself now , kat@@ n@@ iss .
i kin@@ da need you to care .
most important of all ? we reproduce .
it 's the opposite , actually .
and that 's interesting ,
space , dr . bail@@ ey . we don 't have enough space .
we need money . bail@@ ey .
it 's my turn to have cris@@ tina yang on my service .
hostile uter@@ us .
at least it 's not cancer .
uh , as long as they like . why ?
april 's best friend just died , and she 's all alone .
okay ? i find her annoying .
car ran into a laund@@ rom@@ at . multiple traum@@ as !
it 's about a ch@@ ore wheel .
that 's a great idea .
hey , the ven@@ ding machine 's working again .
nothing .
i was at the dentist this morning . i have bad teeth .
i went to the o.@@ b. today .
so there 's a chance the cancer could come back ?
but if we do this , if you agree ,
uh , it 's only been done a few times in the world .
we hope .
god knows , i love to watch you dance , but ..
bo@@ ob@@ s , really ?
he sta@@ res at them .
can i leave now ?
so we had to remove his spleen and a kidney ,
uh , she 's out of surgery now . she 's doing great .
and as for your tests ,
he 's not my husband anymore .
larry left me three months ago .
a week later , i find out he 's living with someone else .
people must tell you their secrets all the time
no , no .
no , ma am .
well , it doesn 't help that it 's halloween .
ladies !
oh ! and do me a favor .
okay , we gotta talk .
hey , swee@@ tie . how was your dad 's ?
good .
i 'm gonna be a swan .
you don 't have to make it . jane said she would .
well , i should go thank her for helping me to parent you .
or maybe you should .
oh , stop . you look great .
briefly . i was young and needed money .
see you monday .
that 's what this is .
no , no , no , no .
what is going on ?
didn 't you once staple math tests
so i , of course , said i would .
well , you 're in luck .
and he 'll make my kid 's cat outfit ?
because he 's got a lot on his plate right now .
he 's been drinking a lot .
no . no . he 's been going to a.@@ a. meetings .
i certainly understand what he 's going through .
don 't move . there 's one by your foot .
so ... you wanna play some video games ?
okay . um ...
only 36 hours to go .
i am the cand@@ y-@@ bot 3000 .
oh , come on . your son is dying to go trick@@ -@@ or-@@ treating .
until i deliver these paintings ,
don 't look at this . it 's not done .
your hands are gonna slide right off the wheel .
i can still feel those s@@ lim@@ y things
unless ..
there 's no body to be found .
dad and jane will be here soon .
all i 'm doing is counting the minutes
they had giant peanut butter cups .
i got a chocolate bomb . you want some ?
but we 've only done half the street .
tough .
or a painting you just walk past
okay , just keep going . this is really making the time fly by .
wh@@ oa ! is it , uh ...
uh ... don 't think so .
maybe i should , uh , take off a layer .
i 'm not sure . i 've got this ...
yeah , and your eyes look a little gl@@ assy .
we can do this another night , you know .
now ... get over here , big man .
this was under the mat .
had me stum@@ ped for a good four seconds .
can we go trade candy ?
andre .
all right . yeah .
but i was thinking about what you said .
god . is that how things work in your world ?
i 've learned to live with that mainly by not caring .
i swear to god i don 't .
my work is always gonna come first .
that 's what i was getting to . i heard what you said .
you may not have a choice .
that 's weird . they didn 't even wait for the candy .
i was asleep . you know .
around 2.30 .
sure .
we can go right now .
in case she calls .
in my opinion , the trial will be a form@@ ality .
dr. ha@@ mel ?
not asking questions and keeping your trap shut
this is a small town here . mister ..
how long can i think it over ?
didn 't you want to kill him ?
but i knew it was poin@@ tless .
in prison , where he belongs .
how is the doctor 's wife . mrs. sv@@ l@@ vie ber@@ ube .
jean f@@ af@@ ard spoke with her .
you don 't approve of his actions ?
i think that his grief has driven him mad .
mrs. ber@@ ube ?
what made you tell the press i 've gone crazy ?
he was calling from st. julie .
anyone would lose it if a loved one was murdered .
give me a second .
roll medical ! stat !
i 'll ride back with the victim .
well , my work is done here .
all right .
what do you got down there ?
the guy 's on fire , he rolls ,
yeah .

that 's more than enough juice to stop a man 's heart .
so either my theory 's wrong
i analyzed the black
i wouldn 't steer you wrong , bud .

storage facility over there .
yeah , all right .
you sure you want to do that ?
so we 've got two victims ,
but our first guy . carl@@ ton do@@ re@@ en , didn 't die .
i doubt it .
really ?
well , if your intent is just to kill ,
both the victims ' skin and clothing
el@@ ijah new@@ bloom 's t.@@ o.@@ d. was

where 's your truck , johan@@ nes ?
get out of there . she 's trouble .
she is a teacher .
i called her .
i wanted an explanation .
she couldn 't make it on a school@@ teacher 's salary alone ,
and if she lied to you once , she 'll lie to you again .
he 's her manager , and he 's bad news .
well , i pulled his sheet .
great .
huh . i 'm worried about her , nick .
well , you better make sure

maybe next time you 'll be ready to do a french tip .
no . sh@@ h . keep your voice down .
there are people on fire who are not as loud as she is .
and then she started talking .
can we watch our shows now ?
what i didn 't realize is that the object of his affection
oh , big sp@@ ender .
it was a lovely gesture .
she spends most of her time with the other cheer@@ leaders .
no . that 's not what i mean .
oh , yeah , right . then .. then you could have told me
why not ? it 's .. it 's pretty funny .
the only thing i see when i look at you is a nice young man
i , uh , i won 't be talking to her anymore . i 've been forbidden .
as a friend .
well , of course you do .
eddie , there is someone out there for you .

but i can 't go .
my mom would never let me .

yeah , it wasn 't a compliment .
maybe that will cheer you up .
perry ?
it was nothing anyway .
perry !
and there 's a message that i 'm sending out
i don 't like hurting people , but this is the world now .
but if i do , i vet his memories ,
the brain 's the best part .
i just want to feel what you felt .
say something
i miss airplanes .
i like that you remember that kind of stuff
shru@@ g .
all i 'll ever be is a slow , pale ,
it 's hopeless .
i should just be happy with what i had .
it 's easier not to feel
it 's just me , kevin . it 's okay . i 'm fine .
it 's okay . i 'm not infected .
i 'm gonna forget about her ,
is that what this is ? corpses don 't get cold .
so i '@@ l wait here .
and it was spreading fast .
oh , no . oh , no . please , go !
that 's it ! okay .
it 's just a stupid name that we came up with
what is wrong with me ?
i 've got to tell you something .
you .. you miss him ?
like you 're attracted to him ?
your zom@@ bie boyfriend ?
and look , i know that you miss perry .
like , i wish the internet was still working
what is going on ? what is all this ?
we 've been getting reports
this is gonna sound really crazy , but
they 're changing , dad . they 're ..
you think they 're curing themselves ? how is that ?
no . you know what is happening , julie ?
they are not curing themselves .
they are not becoming ve@@ gan . okay ?
they eat brains ,
we 're ... we 're getting better .
people get bit , then they get infected ,
i 'm really sorry , mr. gri@@ gio .
and this uncle has hired a man ,
i just want the kid . i will pay more .

bec@@ ky .
my promoter has kindly offered a $ 10,000 reward for anyone
and we 're gonna bring you home . thank you .
how 'd you find me ?
plus , it wasn 't hard
why 'd you change your mind ?
one more thing , i work alone .
but you make lots of noise .

we have a lead
they were either mistaken ,
and you 're just fig@@ uring this out now ?
mrs. f@@ ay@@ den , i share your frustration .
bec@@ ky could be halfway across the world by now .
mr. sam@@ son g@@ aul .
i would not place your trust in this man . why ?
make you look bad ?
competition .
always trying to move in .
i told you ... shut up .
you find this girl as quickly as possible .
that 's not easy . i 'll have to go into work .
i 'll also need any information on someone or something called al kha@@ bir@@ i .
stop , stop , stop !
now what do i tell your mother ?
the girl ? well , see for yourself .
in here .
we 're checking the dna samples from the parents .
i heard him giving the order .
afraid that they 're going to be found out .
i 'm sorry .
it 's not your fault , dad . it 's not your fault .
you can go . i 'll be fine . i think it 's better if i stay .
you knew i was no good !
it 's your fault , too !

a butcher with feelings . who knew ?
here to punish you .

you okay ? yeah .
i was worried about you . the girl .
i need you to drive . to drive ?
all right , please stay away from us . it 's about your daughter .
your daughter , she always wear her brac@@ elet on the right .
what ?
i think so
it 's a setup . it 's all too neat . girls are nothing to them .
i think your daughter 's not dead .
it 's simple .
what do you know about a butcher ?
he didn 't .
together , they leaned on the good doctor ,
maybe the girl is not worth it .
those place is this it 's a safe hose .
look , my daughter is out there . i 'm not gonna be hiding in this house .
did you ever use one of these ? no .
this is insane . we can 't do this alone .
if anyone besides me or my son show up here , shoot him dead .
hey , where 'd you get those ? what ?
mine now .
oh , baby , where are you ?
bec@@ ky , are you okay ? are you okay ?
i don 't know where i am , but you can figure it out .
what ? daddy , please do as i say .
get her computer . it 's on the desktop .
blood diamonds or other conflict minerals ,
there 's still lots of old soviet arsenal to be sold off
al r@@ ha@@ bir@@ i 's a collector . girls ?
virg@@ ins .
american blon@@ des
bring them the one thing no one else can deliver .
so , what 's the plan now ?
hello ?
hold on .
bec@@ ky called .
bec@@ ky called . she 's at ch@@ yor@@ n@@ aya prison .
is she okay ?
no , stop ! hello ?
damn it . sorry , boss , we didn 't expect the butcher .
get the kid ready to move .
please , please unlock me .
they took her to another building , i think .
please let me go .
and now they have tan@@ ya . are your guys sleep@@ walking over there ?
cut them off under building 3 .
i can 't bend over any further
hi . is this , like , a real dance ,
i think we 're supposed to dance like that .
even though you just saw us doing that ,
how did you two get in here ?
you wouldn 't help us ,
stick it in and i 'll watch you play .
you 'd be able to afford a hotel room ?
just like that one time at the din@@ er .
that 's true . keep talking .
did you miss , daddy ?
why ? i will never have any use for it .
his majesty will attend the banquet .
the court is reviewing them .
why ?
why not ?
the danish people have always had
you have a fl@@ air for drama , my dear queen .
" come , let 's away to prison .
yes . thank you .
they seem to think she 's needed .
many of them are saying she is just what denmark needs .
thank you , that is quite enough !
a count is calling . better get going .
should i abandon my bleeding patient for some count ?
what the hell is wrong with it ?
you 're a bit of a mystery , stru@@ en@@ see .
it is a rather harmless sati@@ re , mr. gul@@ d@@ berg .
what is next . the court ? the king ? the church ?
a fine and a year 's ban on publishing will suffice .
as the letter shows , she was quite pleased and asked us to give
if we don 't , the people may ..
... 15 per tonnage .
just sign it , your majesty .
stri@@ kers to be thrown in ...
they all think i 'm crazy .
why haven 't we heard from you ?
what is he even doing out there ?
more than 700 people have died . most of them children .
have you previously tested this inoc@@ ulation ?
what is the survival rate .
the king is letting himself
if foreigners like stru@@ en@@ see ,
bern@@ stor@@ ff , everyone here admi@@ res you and your work .
denmark had become a pioneering country admired across europe .
ran@@ tz@@ au , it 's good to see you .
it 's not my office . this is the cabinet . how are you ?
you have ideas at the same rate as the rest of us change clothes .
we swear . we don 't know anything .
and not a word to anyone !
i saw something .
why did construction come to a halt ?
we can 't afford all the changes .
are you serious ?
all of court will go against you .
gul@@ d@@ berg gains allies every day .
the military . are you sure ?
they say you are poisoning christian to make him insane .
the rest is about the evil foreigner ,
we have to reinstate censorship .
do it !
what do you want , priest ?
and bran@@ dt on the day of execution .
but the cabinet wants something in return .
a written statement saying you were mistaken in all your deeds .
a statement the cabinet will later publish .
i 've thought a lot about god these past few days .
that doesn 't surprise me , son .
you 're sure the execution isn 't today ?
yes , i 'm absolutely sure .
i haven 't heard anything , your majesty .
i can 't wait to see stru@@ en@@ see 's face when i pardon him .
no . why would he be ?
who came up with the idea of
it is tradition .
people must be present to applaud their mer@@ ci@@ ful king .
yes .
that 's not gonna happen .
maybe ?
okay . that 's not going to happen .
you know what we 're talking about .
this is a massive undertaking .
so what are you saying ?
i mean , everything from the lawsuit , from all of us ?
i had some money before all this .
700 grand i can get to right away .
and web@@ ber hired us , and he set a tone .
shoot . sorry . is that mine or yours ?
i think cal@@ lie 's right .
it 's a much bigger opportunity ...
to stay and make the place we dreamed of work again .
oh , god . will you two stop it ?
if i have learned anything in the past year ,
and our daughter deserves
getting ready for disasters that may never happen .
everything that you 've done to make it better
i think we should go .
hey , derek . i owe you an apology .
no , no , i do .
well , we were all stressed out .
no , i know , but i had no right to call you e@@ goti@@ s@@ tical .
on the other hand ...
ca@@ hill said it would be some brochures ,
not a whole lot of practicing medicine either .
no offense , derek .
this is a lot of it .
this is unacceptable .
yeah ?
love it . your head is gigantic .
do you prefer o.@@ r. two or four ?
i promise you won 't remember any of this cra@@ p .
nothing .
we need to tell his parents
so ...
so ... we are going to ...
mr. fin@@ ch , uh , can i , uh ,
um , are you and your wife okay ?
i don 't know . i don 't know her that well .
we hooked up one time .
and his condom breaks
i 'm gonna raise that baby .
i want to , you know ... be a father to that kid .
sorry .
we want to pool our win@@ nings from the lawsuit
yes .
you don 't know the first thing about owning a hospital
i mean , you should hear cal@@ lie 's stories .
no . n-@@ no one leaves .
that 's why we want to buy it ,
will we ?
but see ? we don 't know anything about this .
or you 'd leave again .
owen is killing himself trying to keep the hospital open .
pack him . pack him gently .
get some factor vii in here now .
i got your page .
oh , we 're not .
it 's not real . you know , it 's just pretend .
i thought you 'd like to come in there .
what ?
i 'd learn more from watching that
this is ridiculous .
and now we 're splitting shifts ?
pe@@ ga@@ sus breaks up shifts differently .
and we get sha@@ fted . i 'm not taking this .
if you know how to talk to your people ,
look , i 'm sorry , but this is not gonna work .
chief , i just wanted to ask you again
all right , look , i am trying to work with you .
what ?
this is so stupid .
so we 're in a he@@ ist movie now ?
all right , just ... let 's go . get me in there .
what a pleasure it is to meet you , sir .
oh ! oh , my goodness . oh , oh .
me@@ red@@ ith .
they are not approving the genome mapping at this time .
he won 't get that here .
leave seattle grace and go some@@ place else , fast .
that was the only medical advice i could give them in good conscience .
hey , wh@@ oa . what are you talking about ?
i tried to put on the smile and k@@ nuc@@ kle down
yeah , we 're clearly not following every wedding tradition ,
that way lily doesn 't end up looking too ...
there 's my boy .
okay , c@@ locking out .
otherwise , i 'll just be here by myself .
your dad uses his computer to put in cool backgrounds
i would , but the coast guard keeps her really busy .
she 's probably so lonely with only two other women
37 . and it 's not what you think .
why can 't we be on a farm ?
you know what ?
you guys invited us so we could spend the day together .
couldn 't keep up , could you ?
criticisms are more hur@@ tful when they 're specific .
hey , everybody . i 'm professor proton .
dar@@ n it , i do like objects that ho@@ ver .
oh , no ! i have all those things !
it 's time for professor proton 's
because they make up everything .
yeah , because they do . they make up everything .
just when i thought this couldn 't get any better ,
what ? !
hey , thanks for being here .
how could wi@@ l ask howard to be on his show and not me ?
and he didn 't start an online petition to get wi@@ l fired .
well , because he probably worried
thank you , amy . that helps .
i heard you .
i don 't know which hem@@ s@@ worth is playing logan dean ,
. so a young paul gi@@ am@@ att@@ i .
you should talk to bern@@ ade@@ tte .
what do you mean ?
you 're a woman , you 're in science . you go , girl .
there 's like five things you gotta fix .
then i 'm not buying your house .
we made a deal . we shook on it .
these are reasonable requests . come on , mer .
we gotta be like grow@@ n-@@ ups here .
i hate kare@@ v .
oh , motion carried .
i 'm covering the pit , and santa claus came to town .
santa ?
santa came in two weeks ago ,
so ...
not where i was going .
how many times can i say this is not happening
a person with will@@ power .
this is worse .
like ... like watching two cars head toward one another
people are going to die .
uh , severe abdominal pain , tre@@ mor@@ s , and he 's hyper@@ ten@@ sive .
brian , were you drinking this morning ?
no , i don 't take drugs .
it 's just a sore throat , right ?
so i want to keep her here another day
yeah .
all right , and the judge is tasting it now ,
hello .
it 's , uh , miranda bail@@ ey . how are you ?
well , i took the liberty of forwarding your e-mail on to my mother .
all right . sir .
oh , i thought i was supposed to tell dr. kare@@ v .
yeah . no one named jeff has ever done anything substantial .
n@@ ope . no room@@ mates .
wait . you 're selling him your house ?
i 'll take the floors as is .
why don 't you sh@@ ack up with ke@@ p@@ ner ?
away from you , it seems .
you still doing it with a@@ very ?
god and everybody .
well , um , w-@@ why don 't we talk ? we 'll see what comes up .
how do we do that ?
it 's , uh ...
so we 're talking about a sizeable award .
where 's all the money come from ?
uh , the charter company , uh , aircraft manufacturer ,
the pilot .
he broke his back . he 's paraly@@ zed now .
well , if we find he was negli@@ gent , shouldn 't we ?
um , i 've got no residual injuries ,
folks , listen ,
but as far as the pilot is concerned ,
did you send the chart ?
i told my intern to leave the copies by the door .
i would 've thought that that was a given ,
could be a fistula . could be a dis@@ section .
yes !
now .
she 's awesome
got it .
i 'm gonna let the ceiling thing go .
we already have a deal .
i 've been sleeping around a lot with interns .
i just , i
so don 't be that guy .
so i stopped calling the interns ,
that may just be the dum@@ best and the sadd@@ est thing
sir .
my mother replied to your e-mail .
because i forwarded it to her , she replied to me .
that 's rather graphic , isn 't it ?
i 'm sorry , but there are plenty of other houses in seattle
you can 't do that . escrow 's practically closed .
your sc@@ ans came back completely clean .
did you come in here looking for drugs ?
can you help me out with that ?
can i just get an aspir@@ in or something ?
perfect .
i thought he was just being a teenager
i 'd have done anything .
change your clothes . now .
you know what ? speaking of no self-@@ respect .
let her know if you 're done or bored or whatever ,
and you couldn 't find the time to just ...
yeah , i tried .
you don 't have free reign
he should thank me .
you can confirm with an i.@@ j. ultrasound .
come on .
the pneumonia , the complaint of shoulder pain .
but her throat cultures have been negative so far .
you spoke to my mother .
so there won 't be any more ..
let 's wait and see what russell says .
dr. hunt , dr. yang , what happened ?
it 's hard for me to change things .
so before you go
so i 'm not changing anything .
okay .
it is possible . i saw him .
there were only half a dozen people in that room .
he wasn 't there .
i do . i would have recognized him .
this is a man who took off , what , 30 years ago ?
i don 't know .
it appears that some information
it was your fat little friend , hale .
it wasn 't hale .
the next time you 're in my office ,
all i can tell is
in it , his appendix is noted as present and un@@ remarkable .
i want the conviction overturned
these records haven 't even been certified .
the hospital does not keep records going back that far .
so as far as we know ,
let 's just all
i 'm going to delay the execution for two weeks .
contingencies .
maybe .
there 's always been another way .
man , i 'm so cold my hands are stin@@ ging .
we 're still going out through the in@@ fir@@ mary
now wait a minute . why are you changing the plan , man ?
that 's all we gotta do is get through that pipe
people can 't get through it .
we 're going to have to find another way .
sort of .
we can go into that hole in the guards ' room .
and what about the rest of the way ?
seen a lot of rac@@ kets in my time ,
what do you do ?
you know , why don 't you just shut your word hole ?
i seen that once or twice . but iraq ?
de@@ de , is that your wife
you feel me ?
definitely a daughter .
so , which way is the bathroom ?
hey , blue .
you found him like that .
he was swe@@ ating , you know ?
middle of the night ,
ask him yourself when the doc 's done with him .
bull 's gonna see this and flip his lid .
you got my uni ready ?
what the hell is this ?
you are as stupid as you are fat ,
you 're gonna tell me right now .
what the hell you got going on
any news ?
but you said that you had some pictures to show me .
i 'll get in touch with you
you didn 't do this .
that 's why i married you .
he could be in any one of them .
you do realize this is the treasury department , right ?
just the card , please .
don self , homeland security .
sir , i 'm sorry to bar@@ ge in here ,
talk to angela down the hall .
so he 's gonna be somewhere around the perimeter of that circle .
the 10 , the 110 , the 405 .
good help is so hard to find .
we 're with upper valley insurance .
we can 't track him down , so we 're offering
i 'm sorry . i don 't recognize him .
that 's a pretty nice pot of gold .
now , it 's true
three percent of your commission
just have a seat in his office .
all we need is one more .
if i could hear him sitting down , there 's no way
well , if you recall , i successfully negotiated
now .
got it .
the monetary policy is a means to an end .
this is an important day for us .
you could 've told me all of this on the telephone .
things have happened in the past few days
that on top of the fact ,
that 's the official story .
come on , come on .
yeah , well , it 's an acquired taste .
all right , well ,
apparently , billions in counterfeit currency flooded the economy ,
i mean , so far all the card@@ holders
i mean , it looks like
so the question is : what 's next ?
and nothing happened , and i didn 't drink .
i 'd prefer if you didn 't smoke .
he hasn 't ste@@ ered me wrong yet .
he can 't do it himself .
ex-@@ mi@@ 6 , but he 's still an insider .
is that right ?
you should have left me alone .
they changed their plans so i could join them .
not because i couldn 't . because i ...
so they flew without me .
re@@ za is an err@@ and boy .
you get those sorted and you 're sorted .
your breathing as the bass .
good .
the heart blows out .
what ?
are you out of your mind ?
think of your heart as the drums .
massive blood loss ... clean through the body ...
he 's in the photograph of cal@@ eb 's squad .
he was not a stranger . you know what ?
some of these guys come back with mental health problems , laura .
wow , that is ... hmm .
yeah . they argue a lot .
yeah , that can happen .
no , no , you 're right , you 're right . let 's talk to him .
david , we 're very happy to have you here .
well , no , thank you . no . okay . suit yourself .
well , not exactly .
u@@ gh , i 'm kind of tired . i think i 'm gonna lay down .
but allan , his name 's allan ,
but i know laura , i know she 's worried .
a coke here for my brother ,
i 'd like to buy each one of them a blow@@ job shot .
do you wanna buy anything for their fel@@ las ?
might be the polite thing to do .
i 'm gonna get each one of those guys a cosm@@ opol@@ itan .
no . blow@@ job shots for the ladies ,
you got it .
cash is easy to get .
got their shots and cosmo@@ s coming right up .
you want to try it ?
call the police and tell them the truth .
well , you tried to td them ,
otherwise , i imagine you and this place
here
i got into a fight with some guys at school .
some seniors were picking on me . it 's no big deal .
i don 't know , okay . i 'm just going to go to my room , all right
did he get in trouble at the school ?
where do you want these ?
my man , welcome to the party .
it 's fine . he 's a big boy .
but now i 'm saving money for college ,
well , he 's a drug dealer .
yeah . he sells drugs sometimes to , like , friends for extra cash .
in my opinion , if you 've seen one of these , you 've seen them all .
i mean , it 's got absolutely no kick at all .
yes , sir .
she had bru@@ ises on her body .
anyway , uh , we will leave it for the police
damn thing is this makes me regional manager .
right away they want me to start tomorrow .
well , that 's , uh ..
they told me that david collins died a week ago .
there was a fire from oxygen tanks .
does david have any id ? credit cards ?
why don 't you check some of the numbers he 's called ?
have him look some of them up .
sure .
otherwise , you 'll carry it with you the rest of your life .
yeah
what 's the worst they can do ?
here . you keep it .
yeah , man , it 's yours . i 've got others .
he lost his license two years ago
that 's what i 'm trying to figure out .
the cops found those drugs in ze@@ ke 's room ,
get any information you can on this guy .
yeah . i do .
oh , you 're inviting me over to eat ?
oh , that 's so nice . i 'd love to .
oh , i 'm a vegetarian . except for fish .
well , that 's interesting . leonard can 't process corn .
oh , yeah . i 'm a waitress at the chees@@ ec@@ ake factory .
you 're lac@@ to@@ se-@@ in@@ tolerant .
even though i hate his lying , cheating gu@@ ts ..
yes .
it 's uh .. uh ... it 's a paradox .
oh , of course .
however briefly .
it 's dar@@ th v@@ ader sham@@ poo .
wait till you see this .
see what ?
this isn 't a good time .
why ?
leonard has a lady over .
which is ?
that 's a biological impossibility .
try to hit on penny in russian , arabic and far@@ si .
you did not break up with joy@@ ce kim . she def@@ ected to north korea .
this situation is much less complicated .
she just wanted to avoid having a scene with him .
i 've done a bad thing to you , mom .
do you want to come with me ?
li@@ d@@ ya is calling us . let 's go .
why are you still using a broken mirror ?
may i speak frankly ?
a cracked mirror is dangerous . one day , it could completely shat@@ ter .
so is glen@@ n coming here ? is he going to take me to the airport ?
hey , pan@@ ji , take a look . " x@@ box . " i really want to have this .

i 'm not allowed to look her in the eye , so no .

that 's what we said .
i think it 's because we love to have fun ,
let 's go make her day .
um , that 's lily .
i-@@ is she talking to me ?
of course , ms. love@@ and@@ stuff .
we 're here at my launch party
mother 's recipe .
i don 't know , phil .
i 'm just not feeling it .
what are we doing , bill ?
okay , first of all ,
m@@ m-@@ hmm , m@@ m-@@ hmm . so , what were you doing
how did you know i was in a jewelry store ?
and i could do with someone like you to help me dig out some more .
but we 're small for a reason . trust .
but they 're nothing compared to what 's coming for you .
we can keep them out of reach . but i need you .
t@@ ama 's job is to bribe everyone .
if we get you close enough to ban@@ gun ,
so , what 's the next step ?
it 's the perfect opportunity . get in , get close .
it will only be a few months .
but if i don 't do this ,
he 's out of the hospital now , right ?
shut your fucking mouth !
at the very least , it gives you two something to talk about .
he 's also a major bene@@ factor .
ra@@ ma , listen ,
i believe ben@@ ny and his boys introduced themselves yesterday ?
him .
oh , yeah ? and who are you ?
and when you do , maybe you 'll show me a little more fucking respect .
that alone makes me a target here .
your job is to protect me here .
we 're going to his office .
he doesn 't have to .
okay ?
sounds familiar .
he 's been making waves of late .
the kind that can 't afford to carry a spotlight .
i 'm getting rumors that he 's looking to expand his operations .
that 's where the rumors stop .
i 'll never forget that .
i 've thanked you in person .
but when it comes to the work ,
i won 't let you down .
you have pretty much everything you need .
i 'll pick you up tomorrow at 8 : 00 .
it 's me .
you 're gonna get me fucking killed . day one with a wire ?
yeah , well , he fucking checked me anyway . they burnt all my clothes .
if you do that again , i 'm out .
no , i 'm not disclosing that , and don 't you dare trace this fucking call .
calm down , the important thing is you 're safe .
this guy , any hint at all , and he will sni@@ ff it out .
thank you .
with people like these , you can 't predict how they will react .
and the reaction would be exactly the same .
if they did , we wouldn 't be side-@@ stepping pu@@ dd@@ les of p@@ iss to get to them .
not for a second
it 's all there in the envelope .
not enough ?
oh , yeah . go back a month and you 're right .
but this month , you 're short $ 5000 .
mother@@ fuc@@ ker , stop shaking around .
fuck this shit . where the fuck did you find this guy ?
i hope you 're right .
so take care of him .
you don 't have to do that , i get it .
to support you .
only they don 't come home with blood on their hands .
who the fuck do you think you are ?
if you rush into this it won 't help , it will make things worse .
this is a sh@@ it@@ ty situation ,
i 'm just trying to help , i know how much your father .
who the fuck do you think you are ? huh ?
you mean nothing to him .
after that , we 're just going to cut you free .
go fuck yourself .
murder , extortion , bribery ?
you were never investigating ban@@ gun , you knew that
none of us are heroes
everything i 've built was for you .
you destroyed it completely . huh ?
tell me why . huh ? huh ?
for what ?
i know where you 're from .
we come from the same place .
our f@@ ates don 't end up the same .
and as i dug deeper , i realized ..
we are now the commodity .
that no one bothered to read the terms and conditions .
armed with this knowledge , they compete for my attention ,
what i like ,
cro@@ oked hillary tells lots of lies .
my daughter is eight , and my son is four .
are you okay with that ? "
i 've been concerned for a long time
it was really , like , a feeling of , like .
i became obsessed with finding answers .
this was our project al@@ amo , where the digital arm
we had the facebook , and youtube , and google people .
cam bridge . analy@@ tica was here .
and this is kind of the brain of .. of , you know , the data .
" we gotta target this state . we gotta target that state . "
that 's . that 's their secret sauce .
i 'm there .
and cambridge analy@@ tica claimed to have 5,000 data points
and so the question is , how do you make the invisible visible ?
paul@@ -@@ oli@@ vier de@@ ha@@ ye had a hypothesis ,
i think the beauty of david 's case is it encapsul@@ ates
after the election , it was really exciting .
we were on top of the world
" this is the inauguration . "
steve ban@@ non headed the campaign for tr@@ ill m o .
anyway , and then he told me all sorts of other stuff
people just give it to you ! "
um , i am incredibly re@@ mor@@ se@@ ful for my ... my role in setting it up .
but there 's been a lot of attention on me because i 'm sort of .. i 've become the
but someone else that you should be calling to the committee is brit@@ t@@ any ka@@ iser .
i 'm not that interested in standing up for powerful white men anymore
google , facebook , amazon , tes@@ la .
data is the most valuable asset on e@@ arti@@ h .
it wasn 't until one of my friends reached out to me
i 'm a political technolo@@ g@@ ist
there is , you know , that there 's something wrong here ,
i went and found her and met her ,
i think we now have the foundations laid for ..
uh , and , uh ... her in@@ box and her hard drive ,
in november 2015 ,
and he said , " this is the set of the appren@@ tice .
t was kind of shocked , you know ?
so this wasn 't just an outfit that you put on , and it felt important ?
i feel like the main problem in us politics
" how much of facebook 's revenue
the reality is that facebook knows more about this
yeah , it is . um , lit ...
yeah .
of leave eu 's press launch .
and i was like , well , here o@@ ok , it 's brit@@ t@@ any ka@@ iser !
she 's at the press launch
how can you carry on denying it ? this is nuts !
there was a spo@@ of video of a scene from airplane !
please , let me handle this .
go back to your seat ! i 'll take care of this .
and the whole thing they had ,
last time i left ,
yes .
and there 's still this whole group of people that are wondering ,
earlier this morning , he announced some new measures
so , we 're getting to the bottom of exactly what cambridge analy@@ tica did .
.... to address this and to prevent it from happening again .
well , mr. z@@ uc@@ ker@@ berg
senator , i don 't know that our employees were involved with cambridge analy@@ tica .
wh@@ oa !
the republican team in dc was . i met them .
i didn 't realize how much i had .
did you get the chance to look through all of that ?
but we don 't talk about that .
do you worry at all that she might let you down ?
that is a good question .
you know , done some complicated things .
you know , some things get broken and stay broken .
very pleased to welcome brit@@ t@@ any ka@@ iser to give evidence to
uh , sol pac@@ e@@ book had announced to all of their clients
she 's , like , contradic@@ ting ni@@ x a lot , what he said previously .
you were working on the campaign , but just not being , paid fo ru
let 's defeat her in november .
nobody recognized it .
i watched it in the new york office with , um , all the staff there .
and i think everybody was ..
everybody walked away from the screen in silence back to their desks .
mr. ni@@ x , can i ask you what your message is
but cambridge am@@ aly@@ tica 's gone .
that because of the way that this technology is moving so fast ,
after we dealt with the threats
is the guardian 's stand on this a purely politically partisan one
this is about the integrity of our democracy .
and i would think that you would have an interest in that also .
roger , even if , uh , facebook hasn 't broken any laws ,
i mean , i spent three months , starting in october 2016 , trying to say ,
just taking all of the basic tricks of propaganda ,
and basically playing on instinc@@ ts ,
there 's 2.1 billion people , each with their own reality .
and the other thing about this is , they know that it 's killing me ..
yeah. you get tested in your life a few times , right ?
i was either gonna stand up and do something about this ,
i mean , i felt really guilty .
sleep at night .
what happened with you
and , um , when your family loses all their money
um , yeah , but it took a while for it all to really fall apart .
alexander ni@@ x appears before parliament 's media committee

i don 't know yet . that 's where the employment lady comes in .
actually , i 'm hoping i won 't be single for long .
so we 're done talking about me ?

mc@@ cl@@ us@@ key kicked him out , so i took him in .
mc@@ cl@@ us@@ key kicked him out ? why :
he had the girls in there all afternoon .
wow . those two seemed so perfect for each other .
after what he did to me , i don 't care .
he is ?
i went to the site last night .
they say it 's not a heart attack ,
why is he having chest pains ?
oh , is it the money thing ?
for giving me the day off .
and if you 're willing to keep tor@@ turing my kids ,
what 's all this ?
i taught them some basic forestry procedure .
you might want to keep an eye on that .
you are absolutely welcome to stay here ...
yeah , well , i don 't know if i 'm gonna make it that long .
what ?
you know , the foul mo@@ ods and the nag@@ ging
and god knows i got my own baggage .
well .. i ...
you know what would help ?
yeah . come on .
oh , i do like la@@ ven@@ der .
karen ! is that for me ? how thoughtful .
no . i mean , don 't back down .
well , the truth is , i 'm the handful ,
i don 't think that 's gonna work .
li@@ vid .
he just kept h@@ acking at it
yeah , you should go and look . nothing left but a st@@ ump .
you know what ? don 't worry . you let me work on him .
if 's french apple . it 's his favorite .
yeah .
if you insist .
they say they want to run more tests , but i 'm fine .
thanks . so other than boosting my spirits ,
mike should learn to keep his mouth shut .
wait till i get myself out of this mess ,
i mean it . i 'm still crazy about you .
well , don 't worry about me . i can take care of myself .
you 're doing a hell of a job .
the question is rhetorical ,
the girls ?
what a good heart you have , my dear .
no , i 've given it a lot of thought ,
how ?
okay .
when you are a parent ,
it is gonna change forever .
she 's not even born yet , and i can 't believe
i love her .
i hope you 're happy , porter hired a lawyer .
hey , is that such a terrible thing ?
you think that makes it better ?
do you have any idea how painful that 's gonna be ?
i just didn 't think was gonna end like this .
oh , it 's just a rough patch .
i don 't know about that .
if 's about finding the one who 'll be there ,
karen would be that person for me .
so we got your m.@@ r.@@ i. back ,
she knew it was very dangerous .
but susan del@@ fin@@ o was determined
thank you for choosing to spend time with me .
how a@@ out we stan
i 'm sorry . that 's not gonna happen .

ly@@ net@@ te , remember how you always used to hate y@@ ams ?
what 'd you do ?
i could have , but i didn 't want to get pun@@ ched .
there are other houses , paul .
fortunately . i have another way to handle this .
and this will be your balance .
we should have a lot more money in here .
okay . um ...
hey .

that was a stupid mistake , and it 's over .
big this time .
i 'm sorry , dou@@ g , but i 'm actually happy here .

you were the first one to point out ,
yes , but ..
well , what about parker ?
can i assume that 's your child i hear
right . okay . sorry . forget it .
he 's doing it , mer .
and if he does it , he 'll get fired .
i need to figure out
i was just a resident along for the ride .
i take it you weren 't able to convince him to go grac@@ efully ?
he 's a liability .
no , because habit@@ ually undermines my authority .
yeah , he saved our patient 's life .
you came in a little strong ,
and once he 's gone , you 'll see that .
these vessels are so fragile .
you 're gonna have to suction like your life depends on it .
i 'm trying , but there 's a lot of bleeding over here .
i thought i was .
don 't be cr@@ ass .
you 're fighting a battle that women of my generation
you know what ? these su@@ tures aren 't holding .

it just never occurred to me
mommy , why do you look so sad ?

oh , l should 've stopped at just one drink .
i hope so , because if they don 't ,
just put ' em on a little plate .

our girl 's gone , pat .
it went as well as you could expect .
actually , um , no .
ben@@ ji , you are connected .
the package is still on that plane .
with neither the access nor the ability
imf suspects this to be the same shadow organization
normally , you and your team would be tasked
and now we know who you are .
pursue us , you 'll be caught . resist us , you 'll be killed .
without the secretary 's approval . yes , we know .
well . i didn 't write the rules , mr. hun@@ ley .
a thro@@ w@@ back to an era without transparency and without oversight .
this one 's a fighter .
are you worry he 's gonna take your place ?
yeah , he 's right .
now , let 's see how tough you are .
all of them are either missing or dead , everyone .
russian , french , british , israelis , you name it .
and he always seems to be a step ahead of us .
are you suggesting i 'm helping him ?
and yet every week , you hold me in here .
and today , you haven 't answered it .
okay , nothing could be further from the truth .
i owe him nothing
e@@ than , where are you ? where the hell have you been ?
everything is going to be fine . just keep walking
but i can 't find him alone . are you in ?
yes , of course . of course .
the show 's about to start , ben@@ ji .
just take your position , tell me what you see .
nice tu@@ x , by the way .
investigation lead him to the opera .
in any case . finding hunt is no longer our pet project .
new identity , passport , cash , road map .
everything you need to make it to dc un@@ detected .
i 'm suppose .. what ? sorry , what ?
you came to vienna believing you won 2 tickets to the opera .
he was at the opera tonight .
former mo@@ ss@@ ad .
tonight , i made it official .
the same day a car accident killed the visiting president of malawi .
right before a fired petrochemical plant g@@ assed a village of 2,000 people .
that missing plane was carrying the secretary of the world bank .
that wreck triggered a civil war .
they 're links in a chain . the work of a single organization , the syndic@@ ate .
regardless if who 's in the way .
killing the chancellor tonight was a statement
i was there
i don 't know who he is , where he 's from .
e@@ than , this is what i sign up for .
we need to find e@@ than before they do .
not interested .
look , man . i know e@@ than . i don 't know you .
yeah , all i know about you is you chose to resign .
they 'll never catch him
things are out of control and they 're going to kill him .
we have to get to them first . are you going to help me ?
i believe you
so , to get the ledger , one of us needs to enter the tor@@ us
that 's the only way . that 's the only way .
what 's that ? tha ' s the service hatch
in the pipeline . and before you ask .
no oxygen tanks .
2 minutes . with the current at full power .
well . that 's gonna be like a minute tops .
the more you exert yourself , the faster you consume oxygen .
all he has to do is install the fake profile before i get to the ga@@ it analysis .
so , how are we suppose to find e@@ than and ben@@ ji before they do ?
what do you mean ?
e@@ than 's not exactly sure who this guys is .
he trust her .
find her , find t@@ than
listen . i don 't want to sound un@@ grateful , okay .
one of these days , you 're gonna take it too far .
we 're gonna nail that
i said i could locate him . you 've to find him
if that were true then my goal would be to spread fear , but my .
you kill innocent people .
a virtual red box which i alone would control
furthermore , i was given every assurance it never pass the planning stage .
these people have been du@@ ped by agent fa@@ ust .
there is no secret he cannot extract . no security he cannot breach .
he has mostly likely anticipated this very conversation
and he has made you his mission .
your friend is sitting on a highly sensitive
your final test .
if not , everyone dies .
human nature , my weapon of choice .
whether you let her run in morocco . whether she went to at@@ lee or not .
then again .
somewhere along the line you had a crisis of faith .
without ever asking who is giving the orders .
is t-@@ bag in that hotel ?
well , then you 're gonna help us get it then .
i don 't care@@ .i didn 't travel 2,000 miles down the diarrhea trail ...
well , that 's too bad
and if you don 't think i 'm serious ,
you 're gonna help him get the money
shame on me .
i said get the gun off me or i walk .
you get mar@@ ic@@ ru@@ z ,
but you got to do exactly what i say .
be that as it may ,
the tape is allowed .
it 's who survives .
that son of a bitch took my girl , locked her up somewhere .
look at me .
and if that 's your game ,
i was supposed to meet my old lady there a half hour ago .
they say you can 't miss it , but i missed it .
why don 't you just keep on walking , pal ?
listen , beat it .
let 's say that 's the case .
because i am in possession of some information
maybe i 'll let you walk ..
yeah .
my ...
uh , and i did terrible things ,
then you should never have come down here .
thank god for that .
kept ..
you can walk or get dragged .
no . see , when you had the gun on me ,
well , the scales are tipped back my way .
either we split this money ,
and this goes ? ok , against the wall .
thank you . ok . ok . it 's fragile .
but , mom ...
oh , come on . come on .
yeah , dad , who was that lady in your office today ?
i don 't know . just some lady .
tf looks so small
no . he doesn 't have a name .
oh , of course .
the house just sat on the market while i was in the foster system .
you know , after .
how the hell did you expect to get this thing in here yourself ?
over here for now
i 'm expecting regular calls from my fi@@ ance , michael du@@ mont .
to notify the authorities immediately
in the room . nothing personal .

and after that , the glass is lost .

have you ever heard of the fuzzy trace theory of human psychology ?
i 'm the star of a psychiatric article about it
the plants are still alive , the mirror is just a mirror .
and it 's not your fault .
i had help , and you were alone .
they run in our family .

he 's gone . i promise . see , he 's
i 'm gonna open the door . no !

you ready ?
you trust me , right ?
i may be social , but that 's the boundary line even i won 't cross .
one hic@@ cup left , but i 'm working on it .
our road map 's a little incomplete at the moment .

according to rank , that would be you .
there 's a hose out by the shed in the yard . you can use that .
all right .
who is he ?
and how 's he involved in this situation ?
wait , wait , wait .
the company did know . that was the whole point .
how about you stop with all the questions ?

and you 're the only cat that can do something about it .
and maybe i can get into the guards ' room .
i 'll be sealed in . there 's no way out .
he did .
oh , that 's right . the one out there in the middle of the open ?
that 's 10 years on my bid if i get caught .
michael .
i 'm trying to remember what 's beneath psy@@ ch ward .
you got to think about how to get out of here .
man , come on . talk to me .
if i 'm gonna be the one doing that running , you gotta do some lifting , too .
you gotta do it for the team .
i waited under the ble@@ ach@@ ers until it got dark .
drugs is almost as bad as escape .
it wasn 't drugs .
i want to make sure i heard you straight .
this isn 't about a vote .
now , we have a nation that is growing increasingly hungry for alternate energy .
besides , once that bill hits the president 's desk , he 'll veto it .
you probably don 't have a hair on your body , do you ?
i want you to notify me immediately if and when that happens .
you scared me .
you don 't want to make any rash mistakes here , l .
small potatoes compared to this , i 'm sure ,
it would ?
nobody ? okay , i 'm going in .
i can 't get anything past you , huh , tom ?
yeah , well , you know , i wanted to come here and tell you guys in person .
well , easy enough . let 's just do that again , then . next ?

well , let me help you .
my mom and mrs . ho@@ dge are still talking about that ball thing .
like i want to put on a stupid white dress and greet people all night .
by the way , i 'm doing it .
because i did it last year , and it 's actually kind of hil@@ arious and great .
it doesn 't sound great . it sounds beyond lame .
julie !
okay , you know what ? this is getting ridiculous .
let me go !
hi , daddy .
i need to talk to your dad . thanks .
let me answer that question with another question .
so it 's time for you to live yours .
i 'm just dropping off a few letters .
i 'll be quicker if i do it myself .
i don 't believe this . i was worried sick about you !
you promised me a fun day , and all i got is a sun@@ burn on the right side of my face .
you had me out here , sitting like a dog with the window cracked open .
well , why shouldn 't i get something out of this ?
look over here , mr. monro@@ e ..
have been arguing for a reduction of the licence fee for ...
i beg your pardon .
come on .
of course not .
knows she 's not going to win .
she actually gives less of a shit about anyone round here than he does ,
a career politician .
can i just make a couple of points ?
what is this for ? that 's what you wanted to know , mr monro@@ e .
what are you for ? what are you for ?
jam@@ ie ?
you can 't avoid it .
'the video of his clash
'you look less human than i do

it 's the wal@@ do polling app .
there 's something i 'd like to talk to you about .
john , i just drove 3 hours to come and see you .
and i 'll kick down this door if i have to
i 've got a situation that i 'd like you to take a look at .
i told you , i 'm not interested .
that is my loyal partner , agent cow@@ les ,
he was eating ice cream . he was .
well .
the residence of mrs. e@@ thel jackson , age 69 .
asking our permission to reveal himself , yet never intending to .
is it a cry for help ?
this is too controlled , too sharp .
which she 's going to go home now and finish .
i 'll see you in the morning .
john ? no , none for me
my boy 's having a rough time in school . came home in tears again today .
yeah .
i know . just give him a hug . tell him a joke , a pat in the back .
yeah . a joke .
in the name of friendship , tell me a joke .
okay , just one . um ..
the doctor prescribes male hormones to up her te@@ sto@@ sterone , 2 pills a day .
" doctor . that hormone medicine is doing wonders for my heart .
john , i can 't tell that to my little boy .
it 's a good joke , isn 't it ?
i thought you 'd like that .
why was that ? that smile .
just don 't touch it . i 'm not sure why .
who ?
the husband
agent cow@@ les , are you ready ?
i want you to take the lead .
been a long night for all of us . thank you .
.. i 'm just gonna jump right into this . okay ?
inside my own daughter , for example . she had leukemia .
and one day she died .
in the end , of course , it was a bit of a blessing
and , uh , i certainly wouldn 't use medicine to alter god 's plan .
and medicine can help me discover that .
who killed your little boy .
look for a man with little personal hygiene ,
and for christ 's sa@@ kes find the bottom half of that dress
hey , cop !
maybe you 're right , john .
maybe that 's exactly what he wants , because we found a clue , john .
call it a personal favor .
something really bad
that 's great . can you please step outside with us ?
no . your studio is safe . step outside .
on baltimore , in pursuit .
right !
yellow cab . he 's stolen a yellow cab .
i want to teach my little boy to drive .
i know .
we want for so much in life , you know ?
but i 've run out of time . there 's no time left .
my friend .
bring me everything .
hmm .
yeah , well . that 's what 20 minutes with a rich ger@@ iat@@ ric will get you , huh .
i guess , you know . whatever they think is right .
no , there 's none , there 's none ,
yes . i was conflic@@ ted about you .
yeah . you had no right to take one hour , one minute ,
i mean really know them and ...
if you had , perhaps you would have appreciated how time at the end is ...
at that point , even the pain of life itself
that her .
who the fuck are you guys ?
i don 't see you pulling that trigger .
i 'm simply a man who could no longer look away .
god knows , i would prefer to live the cu@@ iet life
there you go .
day after day . month after month .
he 's got a gun !
we have radio contact with the engineer .
have him stop the train there .
man 's underwater best friend .
i was going to .
wait a minute . you hate dogs .
aka jo@@ gging .
certainly .
and one particularly persistent p.@@ e. teacher
i know !
then see a shrink and figure out how to talk to women .
what 's the matter ?
i 'm behind you .
i am looking at you .
pay no attention to that man in the bed .
not here and certainly not at work .
at my age , do you know
an accident .
until i can transfer my intellect
i can 't take any more of this . i won 't !
how many people can claim that ?
yes , one of over one-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half billion .
oh , i see perfectly well .
do stay , mr. lin@@ t .
you said that last time !
i want to go to that cold place and find them .
um , i wouldn 't have to spend the rest of my life alone .
please ?
i can 't possibly .
you 're a . you 're a great man .
you must understand ,
proof ? what kind of proof ?
well , you can 't very well walk around naked .
yeah , but i mean , his underwear , too ?
i mean , i turned them insi@@ de-@@ out and all , but ..
fine , fine . by all means , crack open the win ...
should you perhaps wait here ?
do you shed ?
you plan to travel all the way around the world to the himal@@ ayas ,
yes , that 's right .
did i leave something out ?
oh , absolutely . like a brother to me .
yes , well , good@@ b@@ yes are so tricky .
oh , come , now , adel@@ ina . i think you know the answer to that .
and al@@ dous was there for me in ways you never were .
u@@ gh ! i can 't even look at you right now .
there 's no need to get upset . such a sensitive creature .
like a ... . like an unhappy bird locked in a cage .
such a vibrant , spir@@ ited , intox@@ icating woman .
i would never wish to obtain the map
get out !
i mean , that 's against the law .
put this on .
do you have a size bigger ?
on your head . it 's a disguise .
look , just forget about the stocking .
what .. what did you just do ?
i didn 't mean all of it .
i mean to get to the himal@@ ayas ,
something you said to me .
al@@ dous believed if we find shang@@ ri@@ -@@ la ,
i 'm a quiet guy at heart ,
that was fun .
and yet here you are in front of my face .
all these years , my husband searched for this .
i wish he could have been here to see it .
come in .
what do you say to a peace offering ?
hmm . yes , i thought perhaps we might clear the air .
no , no , no . my air is clear .
he thinks so highly of you , lion@@ el .
and yet you treat him so poorly .
you po@@ ke him with your stick .
i can 't allow you to go any further .
hand in hand with apes and women .
yeah , but there 's something else .
they 're calling it the grey .
like entire regions of the country are being wiped off the map .
so what are you gonna do ?
yes sir , i did .
yeah . well , because he stole john wick 's car , sir
two million .
put to@@ sef in the red circle and wait
thank you .
and i 've got a phone .
would you kill john wick for two million dollars ?
no , it 's open .
consider it done .
i know i can trust you . thanks for the drink .
i 'm familiar with the par@@ lance , jonathan .
have you returned to the fold ?
have you thought this through ?
you got out once .
where can i find him ?
oh . well , um ..
i just won some money in the lottery .
$ 87 million !

who 's the first mark ?
l can 't marry you .
what problem 's so big you don 't think
but you don 't mind , do you , darling ?
but howard ! the ring !
the student doesn 't earn wages
l 've been killing myself
be honest , now .
l even hired this guy barry to follow me around
well , there must be something .
that does , like , really cut@@ ting-@@ edge stuff .
well , how much does this doctor charge ?
she 's using all your tricks !
let 's use some of hers .
what 's your story ?
these french investor guys , uh , flew me out here ,
m@@ mm . can i have another one ?
as such , you must surely know
because this is how the visually impaired function in the world .
would you ?
he loves you ?
well , then it appears we have our solution .
but i thought you didn 't nail your marks .
oh , so you thought you could play us , yeah ?
bab@@ es , this is not a good situation for you .
don 't go to the hotel now , jo .
come off it .
why did you give him $ 500,000 ?
ilo !

great , by the way . you haven 't aged a day .
is this an intervention ?
okay , when and where did you bump your head today ?
will you excuse me ?
this is your second chance to say yes to his marriage proposal .
you are here because regret has ruined your life .
this is gonna sound stupid .
but my mom made me promise that i wouldn 't , so i became a cop .
but you didn 't ?
when this came around , i figured : " this is my chance to play soldier , "
uh , for luck .
revenge on a childhood bully .
i 'm not sure how you should take a bucket of toilet water
i was having a lot of anxiety , so my mom forced me to go see this shrink ,
anyway , dr. torture ,
i just want to feel what it 's like to be on the other end .
to feel something ?
mr. sullivan , do you mind giving us some privacy ?
in the meantime , feel free to do push@@ -@@ ups or cr@@ un@@ ches .
yeah , that would be a start .
i was talking to you both .
time to make amends for your past and ask for forgiveness .

the word was it wasn 't a week after the funeral
in a small town , people will always
sit@@ tin ' in some hot spring mineral pe@@ eling water bath .
you see pictures of her on these trips with ber@@ nie .
she seemed happy ,
she could do anything she wanted in her life ,
until she met ber@@ nie .
on that trip to belize ,
and i know for sure
she got herself a se@@ e-@@ through night@@ gown
what is a woman her age
i mean , an unmarried man in his late 3@@ 0s ,
that dog don 't hunt . nah .
i always thought he was cel@@ ib@@ ate .
he stayed busy all the time and was working .
now if you 've ever seen ber@@ nie te@@ ide , you know dam well
i call this my wheel of misfortune .
if your number comes up ,
not one .
you see , i was having trouble finding them .
what i did , is i got a rig
did it work ?
hey , get him !
and we 'd like to get a thousand shares of tom@@ mv hil@@ fi@@ ger .
what is this " we 'd like to " part . ber@@ nie ?
let me remind you : you bury people .
i 'm sure we won 't be late for lunch ,
this is my life .
she got rid of all the usual help
ber@@ nie ! you should 've been here hours ago !
i need you to go by the clean@@ ers and pick up my dress .
you fool@@ ing around with those damn planes all the time , ber@@ nie .
okay , you told me . what good does that do me ?
this wagon has all of our instruments on it
gr@@ r@@ r . so i want to have a pulse on each beat ,
one , two , three , four and oh !
this is only going to take a second .
hello , mar@@ j@@ orie , how are you ?
can it wait till right after rehearsal ?
okay , right away . i 'll be there .
how 's it going , carl ?
what happened ?
oh , jesus , no , no , no , what have i done ?
please tell me what to do !
it seemed like the flags were a little late ,
but it was a really great job .
i don 't think too many of us
yes , yes , she missed her holiday hair@@ cut appointment
well , i 'm sorry to say this
i was rather devastated at the very idea
it was easy for her to disappear .
not her son , not her two sisters .
well , yeah , he hired me back for more money ,
he paid 40,000 dollars for car@@ th@@ age awards .
he loaned the money to the yo@@ k@@ ums over here ,
ber@@ nie just told everybody to pay him back when they could .
but they never did .
vo@@ u kn@@ now ? little girls .
thank you .
you 've done more to transform
lloyd seems to be pretty concerned .
oh , good lord , you gotta be kidding me .
it 's like i told him .
she didn 't want everyone to know ,
that 's mari@@ orie alright .
you know , ber@@ nie , she 's my sister ,
she 's just hard down mean .
she used to tear up my toys ,
and next up is mrs. ida parker .
excessive housework , or ar@@ ts@@ y hobbies .
so you saw mrs. nu@@ gent in april of this year ?
with your own eyes ?
i came to her house to get her to sign some documents .
just then , he takes the documents back and she sions them .
okay . it confirms a pattern .
well , it sounds like lloyd hor@@ n@@ buck@@ le
oh , boy .
tell everyone for heaven 's sake ,
i don 't want her disturbing me ,
at this time , are there any suspects in the murder ?
hey , sheriff , did you actually find him yet ?
he wasn 't at car@@ th@@ age aviation ,
we 're gonna throw a net over the entire tri@@ -@@ county area
achieving goals , ma@@ stering skills ,
and if you 've worked hard ,
you can hold your head high ..
she had become so mean and pos@@ ses@@ sive of me .
and then it just .... . happened .
i shot poor mrs. nu@@ gent four times .
then what ?
i know i done wrong and i must at@@ one for my sins . oh !
and i 've known him for a little while ,
and you know that something at some point 's gotta give ,
if we ever get angry enough .
all he had to do was put her body
a woman like that with a bad heart
a few dav@@ s later , he 'd be doing her funeral .
there are not enough nice men in this town .
we don 't even think he did it .
d@@ ann@@ v buck .
did you ever stop to think
maybe it was a forced confession .
he 's too sweet to stand up under interrogation .
he walked in , sat down and told us everything .
well , hell .
it 's not as bad as people say it is .
you know what ?
and no matter what the truth is ,
and right now , ber@@ nie needs to know ,
good to see you , thanks for coming .
god bless you for everything .
you got to at least take him off the prayer list .
neutral ?
you know , all i hear is poor ber@@ nie .
hell , everyone seems to be forgetting
the hec@@ k it isn 't .
although rumors have been circulating
he didn 't shoot mrs. nu@@ gent in the back .
bern@@ hard@@ t ti@@ e@@ de ain 't no monster .
in fact . i don 't know
in the meantime , ber@@ nie sits in the county jail
now a lot of people use gr@@ ated cheese ,
that keeps the flavor in .
that 's $ 14.@@ 74 .
if someone came along and shot you in the back four times ,
as far as convic@@ ting ber@@ nie ,
all the little old ladies ,
and i went all in .
and that 's usually because
so when i heard that the judge
let the jury be able to see
boys , make sure it opens up to the jury .
but , you know , this was the big stage
they projected pictures of frozen dead mrs. nu@@ gent .
and i saw
no further questions , your honor .
i don 't remember .
we were advised to by a lawyer .
you mean , just some old boy come in off the street ?
i guess he was working for us .
oh , you don 't think so .
but you told us earlier
is that the same woman that you have not spoken to in four years ?
i knew he 's in trouble when i saw that jury .
i mean , they got more tat@@ to@@ os than teeth
now . ber@@ nie .
y@@ es. sir .
i loved her very much .
well , if you cared for her ,
i could probably describe it like being in prison
she was very jealous and pos@@ ses@@ sive of my time .
i don 't even remember picking up the gun that day .
so why did you leave the body there ?
oh no , no , no .
that was never my intention .
and i was ..
did he burn down the house ?
he still knew he done wrong .
he just didn 't have the courage
and in the meantime he did a lot of good for a lot of people ,
thank you .
now look , everybody 's
an angel of death .
ber@@ nie ti@@ e@@ de , please rise .
yes , sir , we have , your honor .
y@@ es. sir .
ber@@ nie was a good man .
ber@@ nie had a great heart .
we need more bern@@ ies in this world .
very funny . okay , let 's get the patient up to ct ...
well , then leave and i 'll get shepherd .
you 'd risk your patient 's mobility for your pride ?
have you told anyone ?
which was apparently very wrong and i 'm sorry .
n-@@ no . just , uh .. just .. we 're not there yet ,
i 'll just stick with " i 'm sorry . "
hey .
um , kor@@ ac@@ ick . what are you doing here ?
i mean , really , deeply failing
okay . thanks . just go under .
okay .
i mean , it 's ... it 's everywhere .
okay . there we go .
and , boom . and there you go .
i can feel them pul@@ s@@ ating off the walls , you know ?
she needs good energy .
well , he said that nothing 's official for a few hours .
by the time i asked permission , he could have been dead already .
get that wire out of that man 's body ,
does she think you did this ?
uh , it 's doom metal .
well , he 's right .
it was black
it 's important that i align myself
maybe , i should be making some changes .
no , there 's no need for drama .
i still love her .
i told you , i don 't do that shit any more .
so i think it 's high time that you got back in the sadd@@ le .
it 'll lift your spirits but not knock you out .
now is not the time to lose thy nerve ,
come , sir hung
he 's got learning disabilities .
ah , each band of heroes will complete
and as game master , i will be watching over all of this .

they 're leading us away from something .
you 're saying they 're doing it on purpose ?
something 's wrong . they shouldn 't be this far north .
reg@@ gie , we can 't go this way .
it 's beautiful .
i always imagined there was more out there ,
you didn 't believe me ?
and cute .
nah . takes a lot to r@@ attle a turkey like me .
jake ? jake !
yeah , like i can 't stop thinking , hypothe@@ tically ..
no , but i can imagine a scenario in which i might .
very clever .
well , what if some fel@@ la ..
well , a reasonably attractive , quick-@@ wit@@ ted fel@@ la .
i would love to see it .
i could never leave the flock ,
what if everybody was safe and happy like before ?
that would be a dream come true .
what are you doing ?
the more you say that name , the dum@@ ber it sounds . i mean ...
okay .
i didn 't grow up on a nice free-@@ range farm .
the most important thing for you to remember
i have a plan .
we destroy the weapons , we stop the feast .
exactly !
what ?
so , what 's your plan for getting in ?
it 's our only way out now !
come on !
i can 't give up .
turkey ! turkey ! turkey ! turkey ! turkey !
snap out of it reg@@ gie , we don 't have time for this !
i 've come back from the future
you 're an idiot
jenny , jake , a whole flock of friends .
they 're better off without me .
they don 't stand a chance !
what do we do ? !
exactly !
yeah ?
what does it mean ?
i bet he 's behind the door that this opens !
oh , come on !
i 'm the great turkey ?
which means jake was telling the truth the whole time !
i hate to say i told you so .
it wasn 't the great turkey . it was always reg@@ gie .
he brings blessings to all of you . honor him .
you 'll be in prison , but at least you 'll still be alive .
he 's far surpassed your capabilities .
we 'd have to settle a few things first , like a claim for damages .
shoot ! what the hell is this ?
what happened down here ? what 's going on in this place ?
tony , are you down here somewhere ?
any signs of life ? i 'm afraid not .
tron man is alive !
are you going to sco@@ ld me , pepper ?
i don 't want to be the only adult in this relationship .
especially when they 're beautiful .
tony .
damn it . teams blue and gold , cover all escape routes !
it 's s.@@ h.@@ i.@@ e.@@ l.@@ d. what did you do this time ? something awful , i imagine .
so , miss pot@@ ts . is your boss free any time in the near future ?
of course . being tony stark , he never follows his schedule .
trying to tell your crazy boss about this ,
they herald the coming of the lightning , and perish as heral@@ ds
excellent . we have a deal , my friend .
what 's wrong ?
but i need some answers before you wipe ' em out
fine , go ahead .
i need to know about the men who hired you .
come on , stark ! you of all people
how can you drink this coffee ? it 's like sludge .
drinking it at night in the jungle used to calm me down .
ter@@ e 's the file . i found it .
his father had a lo of assets hidden around the world .
nowadays , a little cash can make the impossible possible .
looks to me like this kid has been bur@@ ying his trail for a lot of years .
according to this , he 's involved in
what a surprise .
let me try something . what are you looking for ?
computer ge@@ eks are something else .
although i hear he 's not very good with a bow and arrow .
you have 40 minutes to complete the mission and get back to the ship .
i don 't get it . what would he know about a place like that ?
then someone bought the property and built a luxury hotel there
the and itself was apparently purchased by ob@@ adi@@ ah stan@@ e .
the wind ?
what happened to the server room ? i haven 't been able to get a response .
i 'm going to fix the computer so we can use it .
i 'm pretty sure i can survive for five minutes without this old heart of mine .
i can 't tell the situation from here . what do you want to do ?
hi there , " old man " tony !
here are clin@@ t and nat@@ asha
good , maria . now re-@@ boot the howard .
to protect it from unauthorized users .
you talked in your sleep when you passed out at your desk .
the partic@@ le-@@ beam cannon on the chinese military satellite is about to shoot !
i want to show this guy something i have that he doesn 't !
this is gonna be our last chance , so listen carefully !
how much time do we have ?
all right , jar@@ vis , pull the trigger !
here we go ! hope your little nap didn 't affect your aim !
i was just expecting you 'd look much older .
you must know a little bit about my past . have a seat .
thought i caught a little bit of east texas in there .
well , mr. phillips , my aunt , barbara van po@@ ole ,
i remember pleasant mead@@ ows .
i used to call and speak with her regularly ,
well , you see , don 't typically do out-of-@@ town jobs , so ..
how do you know you can trust me ?
i think it might be a good idea for you to get out of town for a few weeks .
w-@@ what 's wrong with gal@@ vest@@ on ?
name your price , car@@ son .
the road has always been a fascinating place for me .
there i was , back in texas .
a lot has happened since i left texas .
maybe i drank enough to finally face the shame of my past .
like everything too good to be true , it comes at a price .
well , i get by .
did you ever meet her when you were there ?
that was a while ago .
i don 't know .
now , would happy go to him to get drugs ?
nah , he would go to mitchell .
now , why are you asking me all these questions ?
didn 't like the look of the guy at the bar ,
lt was clear to me that he was a lot more involved
sk@@ ipping the science lesson ,
well , that 's changed .
hired to do what ?
happy 's been blat@@ antly cheating on her all over town .
or maybe more likely ,
maybe they made him the same deal they made me years ago .
you know what i think ?
i think it 's cleared my head up .
wanna do a shot ?
two .
he really was a great guy .
it 's black , isn 't it ?
did you get jealous every time he went home with his wife ?
look , everyone in this town doesn 't like you . why ?
no , no . they said that your husband poisoned everybody
let me show you something .
within a year , people started getting sick .
the reports were inconclusive .
well , that 's not your responsibility .
it is . why ?
wanted life to be easy for our daughter .
car@@ son , she 's our daughter .
when i came to visit you before i married charlie .
well , you sure as hell weren 't ready for marriage and a baby !
come on !
she never had that look in her eye with charlie .
she said you were the love of her life .
she went out to visit you in los angeles just to make sure .
i 'm scared . don 't be .
that 's not why we 're here .
you 're telling me that after what that fuck did to us ,
ya@@ ak@@ ov , son of a bitch .
his father died during the war .
what is your current profession ?
it 's worse than that .
they say first they need something from us .
what ?
enough !
no , we have no idea what his signature looks like .
what else can you see on the outside ?
that must mean the on-site laundry 's on the other side of the hotel ,
you said we can 't make it across the hotel .
hotels use roof@@ top ventilation ,
put me on speaker .
go to 4 dun@@ n place .
make her tell us where sc@@ yl@@ la is .
my only son .
live just outside the panda bay hotel ...
there 's cops everywhere .
no ! the time to take a breath expired when my son died .
warfare applications were not our goal .
who ?
got here a little while ago .
the name of that agent that was supposedly killed recently in l.@@ a. ?
it 's all falling out exactly as christina planned it .
she 's trying to reign@@ ite the 1962 china-@@ india border war
she 'll set off a military conflict that will last for decades
power , money , seem to be things you love .
then russia 's gonna want to defend its borders .
it 's an apoc@@ aly@@ pse in which everyone loses !
all right , you got a name for me yet ?
sop@@ hom@@ ore , junior , maybe .
okay , hang on , hang on . sh@@ h , quiet .
i want my mom .
go ahead .
she 's got multiple complex injuries .
have you seen her ... the other girl ?
j@@ ess , can you tell me her name ?
you have the same hearts drawn on your arms .
i 'm saying that she 's too comfortable here .
we need someone who will surprise us .
instant access to case imaging would really assist with patient care .
it 's more complicated than that .
we weren 't suic@@ idal . we just ...
okay .
it 's a big , big part of my life .
do you like ... girls ?
you know if ke@@ p@@ ner wants a roommate ?
okay , what aren 't you telling me ? you know something .
i 'm being p@@ aged .
what , are you telling me i 'm wrong ?
you bul@@ lied interns . you bul@@ lied mur@@ ses .
oh , no . nobody picked on cal@@ lie torres .
yeah , i was an easy target .
i had to learn how to stand up to people like kare@@ v .
ah , tell you what , though , once you punch your first bully ,
what ? no . mine was self-defense .
my pants were literally pulled off of me
you want to know why bul@@ lies bully ... it 's because they can .
and .. small and vulnerable .
um , but not you guys , though .
oh , that wasn 't through the hospital .
it 's a bit of a passion project of mine .
um , i started the hospital 's free clinic .
i don 't want to make another major inci@@ sion
pierce is in surgery .
that was a hell of a save , mc@@ conn@@ ell .
i just helped change their perspective a little .
hey , why don 't people want to live with me ?
like people don 't want to live with their boss ?
i would have paid money . cash money . like 1,000 bucks .
what happened ?
why are you sc@@ rubbing in for a three-@@ hour procedure
i have the ability to stop that pain ,
it doesn 't matter if i do .
you know , i never realized ,
i don 't believe we were introduced properly before .
did you wait to update the family
thank you
sorry to interrupt , but dr. bail@@ ey has a request .
sc@@ is@@ sor . watch that tissue .
but that 's not the point .
she is new and shiny . and she likes a good challenge .
she jumps into new challenges all the time .
until she finds her next one .
but that 's not me .
this is not a stepping stone for me .
and i want to push this bucket of bolts
and every single one of you already knows it .
well , damn it .
so , um , what is the solution ?
if we promote you to junior professor ,
that is correct .
yes .
hey . ready to go to lunch ?
i 'm stimulating the pleasure cells of this star@@ fish .
is bern@@ ade@@ tte meeting us at the restaurant ?
how come ?
well , i think she just wants you to do well ,
now , what about eul@@ er-@@ lag@@ range theore@@ ms ?
ha ! i knew it ! all right .
which , by the way , is in eight minutes .
all i do is win , win , win
and they stay there !

that 's right .
homeland security is compromised .

you told me you were an able-@@ bodied seam@@ an , and you were looking for work .
yeah , well , you have any ?
would you scru@@ b yourself and make yourself clean .
come and join us .
they 'll still be there when you get back .
stand wherever you like .
what a day . what a day .
can you invite him over ?
can you say hi ?
you seem to inspire something in him .
freddie ou@@ ell .
i usually put some thought into them .
oh , well , yeah .
i don 't like to think about it . it makes me sick .
you know , i didn 't know which window was yours , and i always guess right .
that 's gonna be our time . that 's gonna be our time , right ?
i still find it difficult to see the proof
" o@@ ok through the telescope , " as my friend said .
you 've also said that these methods , cause methods ,
in being able to access past lives ,
you need to tell me so that i know .
nothing bad .
but this is not the way .
all right ? freddie ?
this is acting like an animal ,
allow that there may be color with unfamiliar tones ,
its particles of dust derive from un-@@ modern constituents .
now , memory filters all of that out .
with such gratitude .
come home . you 're late .
no , sir . is that how your mother said it ?
we 're following right behind you .
i 'm fine . i love you !
your fear of capture and imprisonment
this is not you .
when i told freddie about your unpublished work
" how do we know who he is ? " is perhaps the question .
pick a spot over there , touch it , and describe it to me .
fine , fine . walk to this window over here .
it just feels like glass .
describe it . describe it the best you can .
right .
nothing . nothing . that 's what i feel , nothing .
so , if you could all move , except for you , freddie .
everyone .
open , storm ..
cold , out at night .
back again !
i just don 't understand it .
o not do that , please ?
wait till you get to the good parts .
well , as i 've begun , i did notice on page 13 there 's a change .
freddie , i have a matter of such urgency ,
i can cure you .
come to england . i 'll tell you .
" x " marks the spot where the sun@@ ken treasure is .
the captain never leaves the ship . i 'll get it .
like a dream tin@@ k . thanks
okay . glad to hear it .
okay , i 'm off . i gotta go deliver pix@@ ie dust to the other fairy camps ,
i hope so .
hold on , little miss spare parts .
there 's a human house ?
we stay away from humans .
tin@@ ker bell knows that , don 't you ?
grou@@ chy .
no , the air . it smells .
tin@@ ker bell .
wel , of course , my darling .
yes , li@@ zzy .
hmm . the truth hurts , doesn 't it ?
wow . these 'll be perfect for the new wagon prototype i 've been working on .
it 's a good thing we were walking or we might never have seen these .
the door got jam@@ med .
then we better leave right away !
no , it looks like it 's gonna get stronger .
we can 't fly in the rain and the mead@@ ow 's already flooded .
big thing@@ y , dead ahead !
i recognize that wagon . stay on this course !
i sure hope tin@@ k is all right .
a fairy could get used to this .
well , i 'm gonna remain optimistic .
we 're almost there .
did you feel that ? we 're moving faster .
i just have to find the road .
that road !
so , i guess we need to find a bridge .
it 's not deep we can walk across .
but you 're a garden fairy !
ro@@ sett@@ a !
it 's squ@@ ish@@ y . oh ! what was that ?
i can get myself out of here .
i 'm sorry . i can 't feel my legs .
i 'm so sorry , li@@ zzy .
you 're my best friend .
then i could hel@@ o the flowers bloom and talk to animals
where are we going ?
oh , my ! i 'm .... . i 'm flying !
look at me ! whe@@ e ! i 'm a fairy !
this is simply too much .
but i wasn 't having a tan@@ tr@@ um !
if i tell you the truth you still won 't believe me .
i was flying . my fairy showed me how .
but it 's not nonsense . father . it 's the truth !
yes ! and i can prove it .
elizabeth . this is what you 've been doing ?
but father , these are facts !
why can 't you just believe me ?
father , wait !
no ! they 're real !
but father !
it 's a halfway house for the mentally and socially ine@@ pt .
you 're out of your p@@ added cell , but you haven 't really qualified
you might still be under the impression you can think for yourself
if you get a key to the tower , it means you 're getting better
this is the real crazy .
it 's disappearing into a dark corner where no one can reach you .
then we 've successfully eradicated two more identities . do you concur ?
get up . how do you feel ?
say " ah "
don 't you see you 're falling apart ?
this place is a dump .
no one is gonna take care of you .
why are you still here ?
got myself a new entry in the accident book .
bad hair day ?
this place is full of girls with daddy issues , and i 've got the pen@@ thouse suite .
in fact , i 'm thinking of trying out ..
could you give me some po@@ inters ?
it 's good to see you , ho@@ gan .
did you know her ?
i don 't mind the weird stuff , but she 'd never take off the fucking bun@@ ny ears .
do you ever put it away ?
trying to keep everyone 's mind off suicide .
we 're all subject to the same risk assessment .
" brings undesirable personalities under control
most of ' em .
memory loss , seizures and in@@ contin@@ ence . "
isn 't it time you went home ?
and leaves me to pick up the wet patches .
it 's gonna make you boring like everybody else .
thanks for the sugar .
don 't give in .
listen , i 'm coming there on friday to check on the module .
are you all right ?
relax , detective . it 's normal .
well , we were for an hour .
what was i thinking ?
every time i get close to someone ...
i 'm surprised you haven 't jumped yet .
i have gad@@ gets .
hey , put those on . i ri@@ gged an antenna up on the roof .
distant number stations , backwards music channels ..
o@@ oh , have a listen .
the yin and the yang
okay .
of trying to get incrimin@@ ating evidence against alice , forget it .
it has nothing to do with her .
do you want me to come by in 10 minutes ?
i 'm borrowing this too .
and then that wh@@ ack job pushed me down the stairs again .
she 's got a war@@ ped sense of humor .
this whole building 's full of fucking lun@@ atics .
but what do i get ?
but if patient 99 's machine therapy had not failed
what makes you think your new machine will be any better than the last one ?
we all live with du@@ ality every day
hey , wake up .
relax , doc . i am following by the book .
getting quie@@ ter every day .
es , but that one can 't talk , remember ?
uh , the pipes . bad plumbing
and don 't get me started on the electric .
you plug yourself in , you let her out .
she 's turning it into something ... better .
what .. what are you doing ?
i want to meet the real you .
you 're undermining my process .
this is police work , silk . it 's not group therapy .
i 'll get more out of her in half an hour than you 'll get all night .
you need to listen to what she 's saying
after what happened to ho@@ gan , why take the risk ?
bit late for halloween , isn 't it ?
cle@@ o .
cops were here .
what am i 6@@ onna tell them ?
come on . i 'll take you home .
you don 't have anywhere else to go .
that is a confidential file , su@@ ki .
only we all call her alice .
what are you talking about ?
he said everyone he gets close to commits suicide .
when did she get loose ?
who 's patient number 99 ?
kind of the jealous type .
she was trying to warn me
it 's just alice doing what she does best ... pushing
sin@@ cl@@ air , don 't you like this look for me ?
emergency . which service do you require ?
ho@@ gan ?
i was trying to help her .
she was boun@@ cing around the room like a pin@@ ball .
and now it 's out here .
go be whoever you want to be .
i just hope that she 's me .
when you 're crazy ..
you watch them writing on walls ..
and the way you deal with this is you learn to enjoy
ou learn to read in reverse .
su@@ ki . su@@ ki , please don 't go .
this must be an important part .
to . alice !
i did this to you . it 's my fault . leave her alone .
i 'm sure he knew what he was doing .
the machine shows you who you are on the inside
and me ?
think about that on the way down .
had enough of the fre@@ ak show already ?
oh , shit .
is that me ?
why wasn 't i like you ?
ted@@ jo 's a cop killer .
he 'll make a mistake . i 'll get him .
but you 're out of time .
bull@@ shit !
look , we don 't have any choice .
fe@@ ds didn 't make promises to morris 's family .

no , it 's love . tough love .
what 's your fat freddie mercury-@@ loo@@ king-@@ ass got for me ?
let 's cut the shit .
leon ever mentioned that name to you ? say anything about a big shipment ?
that 's why i dropped all the charges against amber .

what 's a good , neutral background ?
hello . guess who just wrote
come on , let 's go . long beach .

there is shit in the desert making noise .
and ?
starving , clut@@ ching this pen knife till dawn .

it was just a psychological security blanket .
i became a man that night . that 's the point .
to teach them how to be a man .
i 'd tell you to stay in the car , but i figure ...
i 'm not too afraid to get out .
i 'm choosing to stay in the car .

you don 't remember that .
oh , you 're getting rid of the murder weapon !
okay , okay . hospital .
oh , god . oh , god .
that was a cop ?
come on !
but what are you gonna do about it ?
you have to pay your bills .
i pay everyone five dollars a week ...
it 's the meth@@ ad@@ one-@@ clinic banking system .
five dollars won 't even cover the interest you 're accru@@ ing .
don 't know , but m@@ y-@@ interest rate in the conversation is zero .
that 's one of the first things my father taught me about finance .
max , i inter@@ ned at merrill lynch .
i had nowhere to go . you took me in .

and since you won 't let me do your hair ,
here 's my portfolio .

would it be okay if we take our shirts off ?
shel@@ don , are you sure you want to be bringing ra@@ i
i have a contractual obligation to provide amy with conversation
hey , there 's my beautiful bride !
oh , yeah ? that 's nice .
let 's talk about that for a minute .
how crazy is that ?
you can 't catch a computer virus .
what do you want , ma ?
bern@@ ade@@ tte and i are starting a life together and ..
ma ..
i 'll talk to bern@@ ade@@ tte .
i 'll just go sit in a hole in the ground
i 'm sure i can get ber@@ nie to come around
you listen to me , if you want to be a man ,
i can 't believe these people won the cold war .
fine .
not even a l@@ ousy post@@ card !
yeah , it 's fun , isn 't it ?
increase the flow on the pump .
helm , i said shut up .
pierce ?
i don 't know what i did .
shel@@ don , i understand
oh , look who 's in favor of compromise ,
she settled . there 's a difference .
what time do you and bern@@ ade@@ tte head out ?
we 're hoping to make it before dark .
you know , you 're right .
i need to stand up for myself .
and if he doesn 't like it , he can move back here .
well , who you gonna hit on ?
that 's your favorite .
hmm ? well , she spends her whole day sco@@ oping .
is it possible you might not actually want to meet someone ?
you are in for such a treat .
he spends all day making these
she tex@@ ted she was coming .
sorry , i had to run across the bridge ,
i 'm at be@@ ak . i 'm tren@@ dy again !
it would get in the way of hearing
okay , they were my words .
oh , no , please don 't make a toast .
seriously , lenin .
you don 't need to re@@ invent the fre@@ aking wheel here .
you know what , i see if i have another k@@ lon@@ op@@ in .
it 's not for you .
should i go in there ?
i can 't take that sad look .
i 'm fine alone ; you didn 't have to leave .
plus , i don 't want to leave you .
i lost bone mass in there .
i 'm so embarrassed !
you got a stomach ache .
i 'm not used to rich anything .
uh , bird bones and pre@@ ten@@ tious people ...
oh , do you think so ?
he 's moving his whole life .
i hate to say this , but you need a mint .
i need to disappear .
max !
great , just in time to see me jump .
oh , i jumped on that bike so fast ,
okay , fine , we all heard it .
well , elizabeth was in much need of a companion .
she is entitled to live beneath this roof .
above or below her murray blood@@ line ?
will you refrain from shri@@ e@@ king . like the blessed french !
i had thought i should one day .
she is rather soft on the eye . i have thought no further of it , mama .
her si@@ ster-@@ cousin has a rather fast tongue .
are we to hear you play tonight ?
before she renders herself sport to some ' gent ' of cruel promises .
that at least is true
sorry , i did not know you@@ i ..
in some way , yes . miss lind@@ say .
if he should .... should want to paint me
next to elizabeth ?
quite . though one should be forgiven for thinking ..
papa ! may we do this in private ?
you may take the books back to the library .
her marriage portion and her inheritance at once .
mr. dav@@ in@@ ier , what is the purpose of the law , in your eyes ?
example ?
and you aspire to the judiciary ?
i wish to make the laws , for that is how i may truly change this world .
make it a better place .
a country lawyer you may make if you pay attention to what you are taught .
mr. cav@@ in@@ ier .
quite a task .. to sit for so many hours .
i appear the only one to have just learned of the z@@ ong case .
why do you judge me so ?
mr. dav@@ in@@ ier , please .
tell me .
i can only tell you what i believe .
or they would not come under the insurance consideration .
that is why they were killed .
these ' matters ' have been for public consumption for months
and i will decide when she is ready for such realities
do so
i should be delighted , mr. oliver .
are you really to defy papa ?
until you .
oh ... it can do no harm .
although , if a desirable match were a possibility .
oh , they 've disappeared . people will think she has no family
he cannot overlook your mother 's origins as i do .
why should anyone even pay her regard .
with lo@@ vel@@ iness and privilege ?
as i do you .
really ?
and i should not call myself a gentleman .
but that would require a change in law .
it is the utter injustice .
nor i you , miss lind@@ say .
goodbye , miss lind@@ say .
miss lind@@ say ...
most evenings .
elizabeth is a determined spirit .
quite a task .
and since there is no male heir
fem@@ mil@@ ess ;
your brother needs a wife who can bring him more and
the 7th vis@@ count stor@@ mont is a s@@ coun@@ dre@@ l
though , thank@@ fully , her cousin is not .
james , you are my first boy .
be sympathetic to your brother . like the unfortunate miss murray
uh , i cannot offer you a title for the next lady ash@@ ford
is i can , without doubt .
and trust that this will be acceptable to you ...
my honor , if you would agree to become my wife .
elizabeth , a word of advice . wait for no man , dear .
di@@ do ?
you have ens@@ n@@ ared my brother .
oh , mr. james ,
have no further use for your impoverished cousin .
well , i doubt miss be@@ res@@ ford has any more
than in an unwanted marriage in hamp@@ stead .
the ladies and miss murray are out calling , your lord@@ ship .
dear , dear bet@@ te .
i 'm not certain he is ready to go against the traders .
and yet , if he does . stand up .
the lord chief justice of england , then it may be impossible ..
that is a fact .
i was certain an announcement was to be made any day ...
and .
at the pleasure garden .
i wanted you to tell me .
i should have .
would choose the man i loved .
i am not in the habit of requiring an explanation more than twice ..
there is little point in repetition .
that is enough !
t '@@ ha@@ c 's correct
in a world where she may be worth more dead than alive .
by the very grace of god .
to share diminished water reserve amongst all those living , at best .
and in such emergency circumstances ..
my finding is that the slaves
they knew the risk since this fashion of transportation .
disease that rendered the z@@ ong slaves impossible to sell
to facilitate insurance compensation .
but then you were wrong .
after he begged you and cried .
alright , can we let our interns do their job now , please ?
mar@@ i pr@@ ish@@ na , 34 , seven days post-@@ op
he saved j@@ ai .
no , mar@@ i , you caught the rope ,
uh , i 'm checking in my wife ... jose@@ ph@@ ine kare@@ v .
you say goodbye there , she goes in on foot .
did what ?
you left me in a car
there were no bears . why ...
this is why we should wait to talk .
dr. grey 's bleeding heart got the better of her ,
did you bring an actual violin , counselor ?
dr. grey ,
why not just pay for the surgery yourself
out of nowhere .
of course i did , mag@@ gie .
i 'm trying to help .
she hung on so hard
and then we show up and we bring him back here
in california , we had a patient .
he didn 't wake up from surgery .
turns out it was fat embol@@ ism syndrome
i mean , owen and i haven 't exactly sl@@ apped a label on it ,
are people looking at us ?
no one 's looking at us .
wait . he left already . right ?
he took a leave of absence . he e-@@ mailed all of us .
i mean , plastics is kind of scram@@ bling , to be honest .
so , where 'd he go , anyway ?
it 's our new chief 's first day .
you don 't need to now .
hi , um , i-i have cancer fusion cells ,
this is all wrong .
oh , look at your navy blue scru@@ bs .
sure .
yeah , great . we 'll talk about it during surgery .
then can you just point me to whoever 's in charge ?
yeah , i know , all right ?
tell them we 'll update them as soon as we know anything .
folks , we need this area clear .
i need an update on my son , kevin g@@ ail@@ is .
yo , dude , a little help .
i made a judgment call .
am i seriously mad ? you know ...
i am seriously mad
we came to an or .
uh , well , there 's no obvious active bleeding .
yeah , i won 't keep you . i 'm just wondering
wasn 't asking you .
are you sure ? because you also tried to cra@@ m
del@@ uca ?
this morning shift was down a couple nurses ,
i would tell you ,
yes , ma 'am . yeah .
he knows to look at the or staff report in the mor@@ nings , right ?
i don 't either , it turns out .
i 'm just gonna e-mail you stuff !
oh . well , if you want a change of pace ,
i 'm your research partner
it was one time , tom .
did my sister put you up to this ?
that 's a good thing , right ?
life surprises you .
what ?
i meant , uh , this conversation 's boring .
what ? is it something i said ?
the che@@ st-@@ blade kid is still in the or .
uh , the cops want a time-@@ stamped copy
no , i trusted my gut . now , that 's not luck .
i 'm still not apologi@@ zing . you acted like an ass .
that 's satisfaction enough .
all right . time for another round of ep@@ i .
trying to access the fem@@ oral artery .
got it .
maybe , together , we make a butterfly .
we wanna give it a shot .
that way , you can go out tomorrow and relax .
so we 're exposed here .
that , son , is a tremendous load .
drop the gun , put sc@@ yl@@ la on the ground .
if you don 't ...
you can 't kill your mother , michael .
and i 'm no longer your son .
oh , come on ! you 're a super@@ star in the verge of free agency .
in the middle of an election year ?
what makes you think i can ?
well , carl 's putting together your itiner@@ ary .
but we 're about to present the budget to committee .
i 've been working on it .
and now you 're working on this .
patt@@ on said he 'd have traded his command for that ribbon .
now , why do you think
well , that 's a very good place to start .
he 's not a gr@@ unt . he 's air force .
who ? tul@@ ly ?
you can learn a lot about these guys hanging with them .
and every day he finds the courage not to stick a gun in his mouth .
and believe me , i get a lot more than i give .
so i saw frank pit@@ sen@@ bar@@ ger .
for all the charlie company guys that you put together .
well ..
love to talk to your husband , too .
well , i don 't have a position or an opinion
you want to talk to jimmy , you gonna have to wait .
thank you .
yeah .
i come out here ,
i hear you went to see jimmy bur@@ r .
he kills things to release stress .
yeah , he 's got a bullet in his head still .
and if you have something that you ..
incoming !
tell him to drop it on top of ' em .
a life for a life .
there are worst things that can happen to a man
losing men ,
i 'm gonna go public with the story .
it was because of rabbit .
i used to take him everywhere .
he and mum used to have these rows about it .
i know he took rabbit away and hid it somewhere .
i was supposed to be going with her ,
he 's visiting his sister . she 's in the south of france , so ...
it 's been good actually .
i think i 'd got bo@@ gged down before but now i can see .
finished , delivered , everything .
so i just went back and stripped loads out .
i decide the ending .
i think so .
was discovered to have murdered his , own father .
a new co@@ der wants to re@@ boot the game for a new generation .
i know what you 're doing .
yeah ?
i want all three of them .
she thinks we just fell off the tur@@ ni@@ p truck .
she 's trying to play cup@@ id .
when you first came back ...
i thought , " right . three weeks , he 's gone . "
why don 't you just eat it like usual ?
hm ? what 's that ?
something 's glowing in the spring !
did you see that , hawk ?
you 're much more gentle , though .
you came here to find a way to save your land , right ?
what you 've started is not meaningless .
i wanted to save the kingdom of li@@ ones too .
you , too ?
everyone , prepare to land .
this is
what is the meaning of this ?
was that supposed to happen ?
the demon clan !
there 's so many of them !
the resurrection day was supposed to be much later !
we have the great oo@@ ink with us !
the ceremony will have to wait .
for our most precious wish !
what is that ?
name yourself !
descendants of the goddess clan !
your dirty little souls will all be dev@@ oured by me ,
awa@@ ken , o great beast !
i 'll head to the top of cra@@ ggy peak .
oh , a flying captain lef@@ to@@ vers .
hot , hot !
we 're saved !
i will be your opponent now .
you 're going to play with me , right ?
that 's one down !
how can you still be alive with needles all though your body ?
you wanted a hug , right ?
the six knights of black .
yet , you 're so lawless , even the demon lord abandoned you .
you bast@@ ard !
my skills have surpassed that of the ten commandments !
are you finished ?
how dare you hurt our friends !
won 't move ..
you 're up to no good , aren 't you ?
how could the captain lose ?
he 'll be okay , right , mer@@ lin ?
but this sword appears to be quite dangerous .
this is due to the hidden power of the winged sword .
this sword can only be handled by the head warrior .
sol@@ a@@ ad ..
father !
you are all right ?
what about your injury ?
it 's said they even prey on the demon clan .
the time of ruin .
we 'd better revive the captain real quick and stop that monster .
you must not pull out that sword .
he is a demon ! a high-@@ ranked one at that !
a demon was pretending to be sol@@ a@@ ad ?
master z@@ oria ....
for 3,000 years , the winged sword has been passed down so that we can fight
countless lives have been lost in these battles .
do something , gran@@ ny !
master z@@ oria , the beast is headed this way !
i will follow suit !
the desire to protect people has nothing to do with laws .
it 's a bit late in the afternoon , but i still have plenty of power left .
i wanted to observe this exchange a bit longer , but
you can leave it to us !
you guys protect the women and children in the plaza !
you can die alongside the cel@@ esti@@ als !
no , the plaza !
we can 't let it get near the plaza !
new spirit spear ch@@ asti@@ e@@ fo@@ l . second form .
fil@@ let and roast !
you 're in the way !
master z@@ oria , the seven deadly sins are batt@@ ling the in@@ dur@@ a .
you too ...
i don 't deny that i was a co@@ ward .
i have paraly@@ zed his sight .
you 're different from what i 've heard .
thank you for protecting this village while i was away !
after we get rid of that beast .
hey . you know what might be fun ?
vern , i worked the cat@@ walks in milan and paris .
you can 't afford not to .
what did she mean by " you can 't afford not to " ?
what do you mean ?
did i ever get violent ?
look , i 'm serious .
oh , that was a collection i was taking up for the children 's hospital .
did you donate the photos , too ?
what exactly is it you 're accusing me of ?
i 'm taking her dinner up .
no , i 'd rather do it myself .
oh , well , i 'll let her know you 're coming .
i was ... thirsty .
does no one in this house ever bother to knock ?
let 's go .
he doesn 't want you to hear the truth ...
what ?
how he broke her heart .. and mine .
you shut up , mother .
i thought that was harvey big@@ s@@ by 's mistress .
future generations depend on men like him ,
when i first encountered has@@ k@@ ell moore 's writing ,
i 'm only willing to conceive that he makes a compelling case
k@@ up@@ aka very happy here .
the reason behind this natural order .
i 've been listening to this for weeks , i ...
let 's see ..
and what does he have to say about the nature of women ?
he wouldn 't be the first .
well , uh .... the question he does pose is ..
reverend hor@@ ro@@ x ' real specific how to run plantation .
god , this heat is unbearable . how do they take it ?
thanks for the wai@@ st@@ coat .
st. george and the dragon .
sometimes you sl@@ ay the dragon ,
i 've had this little melody for viol@@ a ratt@@ ling about my head for months ,
soft and simple . got it ? now , it gets interesting .
play that back .
um .. what key are we in ?
and the time signature ?
friends like us don 't need appointments .
visited der@@ mo@@ t in the joint .
" honor thy consumer . "
did you ever think about the future ?
twelve stars meant an end to our contract .
excitement .
did your sister servers feel as you did ?
what has happened to se@@ er rhe@@ e ?
it is unfortunate that it had to happen with everything gone so well .
and if they do ...
you can remain here and risk being discovered ,
aye , aye captain .
mr. bo@@ er@@ ha@@ ave had my cabin changed .
henry argued in vain that the polyne@@ sian worm was not contagious .
all i want to do now is return home
america loves oil .
some fanta@@ size about wind turbines or pe@@ at gas .
i need help .
i 'm going through it again , mr. ca@@ ven@@ dish , but the total 's right .
how is this possible ? the ru@@ ddy money was pouring in .
mc@@ cl@@ us@@ kie !
mon cher , this " ca@@ ven@@ dish the ra@@ venous , " your favorite timothy .
you heard it correctly , charles dic@@ kens ' own original
okay , what about sir arthur con@@ an do@@ yle 's desk ?
blood has always trum@@ ped water .
this dream of yours is going to kill you . and for what ?
i got to go , captain .
i 'll be right up .
it 's me , lu@@ isa .
i had been there before .
ur@@ sul@@ a .
i could think of no other serious applicants .
and more importantly ,
" our lives are not our own .
past and present .
and every kindness ...
come on , out you come .
thank you , mr. e@@ wing .
oh , you safe , mr. e@@ wing .
ah . right .
my uncle was a sailor .
why the preci@@ ent 's life worth more than a val@@ ley@@ sman ? !
i know the way !
you 're warned .
and i never make idle threats , mr. ca@@ ven@@ dish . never .
make me eat soap powder ? i 'd like to see you try .
a disappointing start .
it was music that poured from his eyes , and breath@@ ed from his lips .
what@@ -@@ what are you doing in here ?
i 'll be with you the whole way , now focus on me .
right here . i won 't let you go .
very well , let 's see you 'd lower the main top , son .
mr. bo@@ er@@ ha@@ ave , ready my piece .
p-@@ please , you can 't do this .
specially when it concerns nig@@ ger st@@ ow@@ -@@ away .
bo@@ er@@ ha@@ ave , you don 't make a mess of my deck .
look , if you can just hear me , i 'm ...
i had .
you ever read any of that stuff ?
but the relationship was doomed .
karma , that sort of stuff , i-i couldn 't stop myself from laughing
that i knew when i opened that door .
most ?
if i help you , i close my job ..
and it will be worse than worse .
whatever you can 't not do .
you 'll do no such thing , you 'll leave only when i say you can leave .
when it is finished , then i will decide what you do with you .
good luck with your composing . i 'm sure a sterile old fuck like yourself
mack@@ err@@ as himself wrote , and i quote :
be warned . leave here without my consent ,
i won 't let you go again .
two things became clear .
what are you going to do ?
" it will end in tears . " you 've warned me .
wait , please ...
excessive force confirmed .
what are you doing , boy ? i thought i made myself clear .
under the conditions of this relationship ,
please ... . you 're a co@@ ward .
you won 't pull that trigger .
yes . yes , well ...
i 'm not gonna hurt you . i just want to talk .
and if i wanted to kill you , you 'd be dead already .
you are lester rey 's daughter , that 's for god@@ damn sure .
korean war .
that 's me on the end , next to your dad .
if your father hadn 't done what he did , i wouldn 't be here .
you get that same look your father used to get . you see i told you .
hoo@@ ks doesn 't want the report discovered ,
this is about the future of energy in this country .
the more deaths , the better .
ay@@ rs has the dogs after me .
i should call the cops .
how do i know you 're not lying to me ?
we need that report .
general ap@@ is .. you , my dear ..
i 'm sorry .
it would be a difficult choice for anyone .
cross your fingers n ' toes .
you said she wasn 't gonna be a problem .
where 's the ru@@ ddy key ?
his wife was driving , she took it ,
it 's absur@@ dly simple , there is gold in your trunk , i want it .
get off mr. e@@ wing or you know i kill you !
we must all fight .. and if necessary , die
it 's done .
18 minutes later , the enfor@@ cers attacked .
and so to know thy@@ self is only possible through the eyes of the other .
hide .
cat@@ kin ...
home .
make them pay .
thank you .
a kind of ... natural phenomenon .
i finished it in a fren@@ zy that reminded me of our last night in cambridge .
didn 't think the view could be anymore perfect ,
and i 'll be waiting for you there .
yes , thank you . i-i 'm looking for a friend who came to edin@@ burg ...
find me beneath the cor@@ si@@ can stars where we first kissed .
that is correct .
yes i do .
i mean that i will always be .
from womb to tomb , we 're bound to others .
and by each crime and every kindness ,
i owe my life to a self-@@ freed slave .
this would make such a good book .
outside , fat snow fla@@ kes are falling on slate roofs and granite walls .
unlike sol@@ zhen@@ it@@ sy@@ n , i shan 't be alone .
you 're not going anywhere .
i 'm about to put a needle in your face .
did they come by with the forms ?
there 's no way you can fight .
you know how many times we 've heard the warnings ?
it 's a drag . okay ? there 's no question . i get it .
ric@@ ky gets it . nobody else gets it .
people cr@@ inge as soon as you start cough@@ ing ,
depression is dangerous .
with nobody who understands you , that 's dangerous .
and one day we decided
no , i don 't .
you 're doing your job .
i already had your respect .
get in here .
yeah , i need you to check my eyes .
i don 't know how this cra@@ p works .
good .
yeah , but if i squ@@ int ...
read the chart , line 8 .
d , c , p , i .
shut up .
yeah , and you look like a real mor@@ on .
can you even see enough to operate ?
don 't quit your day job .
you want me to do something about that ?
i don 't care what kind of baby it is .
a special needs baby can be a very sick baby .
it 's not all hu@@ gging and the special olympics .
part of that doesn 't include you .
all right , if she gets a minute , then i get a minute , too .
i have a patient . the patient gets a minute .
you think i 'm making it up ?
so now you 're taking my temperature
your friend , uh , she doesn 't need my help .
so i should just ask you out again ?
are you free for dinner ?
well , at first i thought it was a benign cy@@ st ,
oh , good lord . why did you wait so long ?
we just saw the patient for the first time today .
they do .
ky@@ le 's mother has alzheimer 's .
and ky@@ le 's taking care of his mom
yeah , all right . call protective services .
at least one of you here understood that , right ?
you just told me
this happens all the time .
you know , i 've got three specialists on their way
you 're registered as a parent who negl@@ ects his kid .
you have to call him off .
believe me , i like it way less than you do .
no one likes the idea
or she could get the place@@ bo , and in 18 months ,
it 's enough of a nightmare already .
what , so he shoots us down .
just check with her .
oh , uh , ky@@ le 's mother may not have a lot of luci@@ d time .
do you know when protective services
when the children aren 't in danger , they go away .
but they can have a k@@ nee@@ -@@ jer@@ k reaction
i am sure that they are not ...
but social workers , on the other hand ,
for simply for stepping in
and you 're sure about that , right ? you 're 100 % sure ?
ah . that must be a nice feeling , huh ?
what are you writing ?
i 'm writing about your ears .
there 's nothing wrong with ' em .
no , ma ' am .
i tri@@ pped at the pharmacy . i have faulty shoes .
i ... needed some cough syrup .
uh , can you breathe into this tube for me ?
my husband sent you in here
you don 't have balance issues .
and those behaviors are consistent with substance abuse .
okay , you know what ? i 'm trying to eat ,
you 'll decide ?
and any@@ how , i have the bigger vote .
yeah .
we 're co-@@ parenting , all of us .
it 's not some cute arrangement where you humor me
you don 't get a bigger vote . i 'm a parent !
so he says we 're only gonna have one sink in the bathroom ,
she fell down , and she couldn 't get her story straight .
and he thinks , because i 'm on derek 's study ,
yeah .
okay .
and i don 't hate him , but ...
and yet , somehow that 's .. what i got .
i mean , it 's his kid .
i never , ever forget that .
okay , can we just be honest about the fact
i mean , you get it all . and me ?
my dream doesn 't look like this .
l@@ exi@@ e , are you here ?
but not good enough .
" you need to practice more , han .
" whole family going on vacation
um , she might be . i 'll go check .
you 'll be very happy .
someone you like , someone you want to kiss ,
what 's johnny doing here ?
i smell pat@@ ch@@ ou@@ li and pre@@ tension .

and why would you choose to hang that ?
i was trying to be cool , but i 'm not cool .

hey ! enough !

you weren 't thinking about justice the other night .
i like that line of thought .

i don 't understand .
i know .
everyone was set a-@@ twitter .
it 's not surprising that the story

i bet you 're not so mean , are you ?
no , you 're just a little puppy , right ?
you want to play ?
yeah ?
i thought you were going to egypt .
that 's not how a ou@@ est works .
what is the quest ? gold ?

they 're just things ,
it 's more one of those .
" who 's gonna look away first ? "

wh@@ oa . i 'm sorry .
please . so it seems .
excuse me , sir . today , we were ..
was saving those for the children .
well , that does change things , doesn 't it :
do you have the share certificate ?
was just saying you won 't have to worry .
but you said we don 't have enough money .
i am a banker now , aren 't i ? that 's what bankers do .
but you 're not a banker . you 're a painter .
the day has hardly begun ,
yes , yes , let 's get your hats on , shall we ?
t is wonderful to see you .
so , you know her , then ?
what brings you here after all this time ?
i 've come to look after the banks children .
but we don 't need a n@@ anny .
mary pop@@ pins flew here on a kite .
what are you talking about , gi@@ e@@ or@@ gie ? don 't be silly .
when your father and i were young , we used to imagine
" actually " what ?
don 't you see , michael ?
the poor woman has nowhere to go .
oh , don 't be so grum@@ py .
give mary pop@@ pins a chance .
nothing .
it can mean anything and everything .
come along . time for a good , clean start .
well , in my experience , ann@@ abel ..
well , then that 's it , it 's not here .
lt was amazing ! and then there were these boats !
we swam through a pirate ship !
you 're right , father . we 're sorry .
i don 't mean to be cross with all of you . ..
georgi@@ e banks , come back here .
yes , mary pop@@ pins .
on you go , spit spot .
useless as a chocolate te@@ ap@@ ot .
and who do we think is gonna fix that :
what do you think , mary pop@@ pins ?
but how are we going to do that ?
but we can 't fix the carriage wheel .
everything is possible . even the impossible .
and back to the nursery we go .
can 't we stay in this bowl for a while ?
sh@@ h . it 's all right .
you were right , mary pop@@ o@@ ins ! a cover is not the book .
whatever are you talking about ?
no , gil@@ lie is right here , sleeping , as you should be .
and the wolf said we were never going to see our home again !
oh , listen to the three of you .
after all , you can 't lose what you 've never lost .
good morning , jane .
the children and i are heading into town
work calls , i 'm afraid . we 've got a rally today .
still , today or never , that 's my motto .
follow me .
you do not listen to top@@ sy .
it has begun !
you have guests , cousin .
and how am i to do that , please .
very well , we " i come to you .
not very much , i 'm afraid .
our mother always said it was pric@@ eless .
mary pop@@ pins is right , for once .
thank you , cousin .
and don 't you worry about mother 's bowl .
so you come back , maybe , next second wednesday ?
good afternoon .

as michael banks is an employee ,
i mean ...

why don 't you all hel@@ o yourselves ?
" office of the bank chairman . " we can 't go in there .
to pay off that loan .

l told you to bring them straight home .
we 're sorry we 're late , father .
we got lost in the fog .
not you , ml@@ ary pop@@ o@@ ins . in here .
you could have lost me my job .
have you any idea how difficult it is to find
lt wasn 't her doing , it was me .
we thought maybe if we talked to mr. fr@@ ye .
we were only trying to hel@@ o .
now ...
and i 've done al . i can ..
t 's too hard . i just .
and there 's no more time ,
don 't know@@ l what to do .
everything 's fallen to pieces since your mother .
we haven 't lost mi@@ other .
l hope ' m as clever as you when i grow up .
of course , you 're right , georgi@@ e .
and in your walk , john ..
" certificate of shares "
we need to get to the bank !
um , seven minutes to midnight .
we need to be at the bank by midnight .
you still wouldn 't make it in time .
why not ?
even the impossible .
can we turn back time ?
but that 's ridiculous .
lt can 't be true !
never you mind about that .
the clock must have stopped .
ie 's made it in time !
but , sir ... now , mr. fr@@ ye !
what 's that ? where did this go ? uh
and does it matter that it 's all cut up in bits ?
it 's still valid , so long as all the pieces are there .
now , georgi@@ e , there was one more piece , a corner piece ..
do you remember that ?
take your children out of here , banks .
don 't you dare insult my children .
they are not lying , and you know it !
we did ust that .
and after several quite clever investments ...
or maybe the authorities are looking for them .
we ain 't no international criminals , you dig ?
this cat getting on my last god@@ damn nerve , man .
hey , wait a minute .
where were french@@ ies in world war ii ?
well , we found the gold , and we ...
later on , we come back and collect .

sorry , br@@ o .
that 's my boy . he deserves a fair share .

half .
i ain 't getting fuc@@ ked again . trying to fuck me with salt in the vas@@ eline .
big red one , 2nd battalion , 13@@ 6th regiment .
we 've got to find
ain 't got the gu@@ ts paul got . it ain 't their fault .
worth a try .
blood , this ain 't my first time in nam .
we 're all gonna live .
yes .
okay .
bed sounds good . i 'm exhausted . o@@ oh ...
let 's get a good night 's sleep .
it 's gonna be great .

they found sy@@ r@@ inges and anti@@ freeze at your house .
but fel@@ icia was at my house when i was making paul 's food .
any way to prove it ?
believe me now ?
his name is chuck , he 's a detective ,
you sound surprised .
oh , who am i kidding ? i love it . b@@ ree ..
you say that about everyone . you said that about tom sc@@ av@@ o .
but as far as detective hot@@ tie goes ,
i 'm sure it was . i never forget a gay face .
chuck was married for 18 years .
failed marriage . let 's connect those dots .
he 's a cop . if 's a very masculine culture ,
you will know everything there is to know about a firearm
ms. sol@@ is ,
protection . why a gun ?
well , for one , if you leave a gun in the house ,
but fel@@ icia 's gone . you 're safe now .
it 's just time for me to go .
you belong here .
well , that 's not true . when i first moved here ,
we had to be nice . we came here running away
and it did .
that was a long time ago .
i con 't talk about this here .
i did love pete crow@@ ley like a brother .
at least i did ...
your partner and your wife ?
i 'm a detective . i 'm supposed to notice things .
part of me thinks she 's dragging it out
so you 're really not gay ?
fab@@ ulous .
bran@@ don to the service del@@ i .
this is why kids shouldn 't play with cans .
you sound surprised to see him .
pretty damn good .
it 's a mess out there . it 's pouring .
god . it 's like you 're not even trying .
from where i sit , you 're not .
fel@@ icia 's right .
the man you think i am ...
but i want to be that man again .
i have a confession to make .
taking control of our fears ..
but the danger of a sense of security is
one clear , moon@@ lit evening ,
the tan@@ gy salad ...
but the most memorable part of the evening ...
in the year since she had left the lane .
the laughter of happy children .
you go first . just don 't use all the hot water .
so .. the kids are gonna want dinner .
fine .
yeah . still do .
would you believe that ? i told you she was mad . she 's mad .
we didn 't mean to hurt your feelings .
it 's just .... to be away so long and be totally ignored ...
who wants coffee ?
it 's dou@@ g , my ex . third time this week .
will i say yes ? well ... . depends .
aw . you guys don 't have to go to all that trouble . whose house ?
if 's an old-fashioned progressive dinner .
uh , salad at mine .
arthur ?
tear it up . we can do better .
that 's the good thing about a small town .
okay , so you 're a liar .
you were in las col@@ inas stirring things up again .
don 't come near me !
i 'm not the little girl
as long as my mother 's dead .
you go . i should probably get to the office
this is about doing something nice for susan .
why the hell do you have a gun ?
what ? i thought he was dead .
what did that bast@@ ard want ? did he lay a hand on you ?
but in your case , i 'll make an exception .
oh , good . the g@@ ays are here . let the fa@@ w@@ ning begin .
it 's good to see you holding up so well .
oh , your ex-@@ husband getting re@@ married .
which you obviously do not watch .
we thought you knew .
that 's why he was calling me . he 's getting married .
for@@ ks ?
the recipe called for mandarin oran@@ ges .
yesterday , and i went and got them myself .
but ...
it 's in the closet .
i 'll get the for@@ ks .
aw , thanks , karen .
you tell it .
you don 't have to tell it .
excuse me .
what are you doing with this guy ?
then , when ...
i suddenly realized what i had been feeling
hello , everyone .
my oven mal@@ functioned .
but , uh , chuck and i
i 'll bet it was .
well , as b@@ ree 's already pointed out ,
so i , um , i used my shirt , and ...
vigorously that , um ,
mike and i just wanna thank you guys
and , ly@@ net@@ te , you and tom make a great salad ,
which was the perfect tribute to me .
oh , it 's gonna snow , trust me .
all right , so what 's the plan ?
you 're so white , i 'm worried we 're gonna lose you .
opening my balcony doors and watching it fall
the only snow angels you 'll see this year
i just got an email
they 're doing neighborhoods now ?
the producers are on their way over
okay , you have to stop saying that .
she 's gained 25 pounds in one year .
max , we all have to look our best , " cause ready ?

so now , i 'm looking up handicapped animals
i got your handicapped animal .
let 's not get personal , we all want this to work .
okay , you tell me ,
wow , show business is rough .
last time i checked .
she really loves him and wants this to work out .
i still have to feed him and take care of him
so it 's not gonna work out , girls .
come on , let 's go .
and , yes , we may have seen better days ,
it 's not to your liking ? sorry .

and , uh , o@@ oh , al@@ dac@@ tone for hypertension .
a lot .
i wouldn 't know .
three andrew jack@@ sons say i , uh , run this table .
what does that mean ?
but , uh , that would be rob@@ bing peter to pay paul .
what kind of a big , beautiful beast of a car is this ?
i think she 's lonely . i think she wants us to take her out .
this car belongs to the jar@@ gon@@ ie@@ w brothers .
he 's looking for , what is known in french ,
i@@ ren@@ a fell down the stairs .
who , me ?
well , we won 't pay ya .
wend@@ y .
i guess .
go easy on him , girls .
he would pump it up on a vacuum cleaner .
he said , every day he would just ..
i mean why do you put your dick in it .
there 's other ways .
they put bees in it .
who knew you were a fre@@ ak in bed .
i don 't feel that great .
i-i never went out on my wife before ,
you don 't get over that in five minutes .
the cops are not following us .
if he slow@@ s down , he may fall asleep .
come on , she 's got no clothes on . give her your pants .

my pants are important to me . gim@@ me , give , come on .

how 's everybody doing over here ?
doc , i didn 't know you had so many friends .
well , let me know if i can get you anything else .

holy shit . who are you guys ?
oh , my baby , i 've missed you .
no , she seems , uh , firm about it .
why don 't you wait here about 10 minutes , and then come on in .
i don 't understand the question .
it 's true , but i know ya , at the same time .
they 're fuc@@ kin ' animals .
" the nut@@ cr@@ acker " was my favorite .
i got blood all over my jacket .
you can wash them .

why ?
just give him a few more years . what 's the difference ?
give me back the dress .
you can 't force me to take off this dress .
in three seconds , your eye@@ balls will be on fire .

maybe i should watch so that if it breaks again , i can fix it .
so that the flap works .
i 'm gu@@ essing he passed out from the pain .

which proves she can be trusted .
you can count on it .
thanks for the flowers .

it acts more as a ref@@ lex .
animal life on earth goes back millions of years .
but it isn 't until we reached human beings at the top of the animal chain

in particular , this allows it
and this is the crucial part of our philosophical reflection we have today .
lucy .
nothing . just a little horizontal sl@@ it .
i 'm not in the mood .
this first stage would give us access to and control of our own body .

can you give us an example ?
not since the sh@@ ales escape , am i right ?
well ..
and you 're not getting out of here until i do .
civilization .
you tell me .
and the use of your phone , if you 'd be so kind .
first thing i do , we get home : clean underwear .
i guess go back to that liquor store
we were so close .
i 'm sorry .
i 've heard about these kinds of places .
i 'll take the le@@ ech@@ es in here
sort of depends on where the le@@ ech le@@ ech@@ es
i can 't ... i can 't move !
no , i don 't think so .

i 'm gonna check your foot .

it reflects andrew 's interest in the performing arts ,
it 's just that my lawyer told me

howard k@@ eck ?
i mean , he 's a very respected member of the community .
what were you and andrew talking about today at the fair ?
i was gonna make some cocoa . would you like some ?
look , andrew asked me not to say anything ,
how to put this ? uh ..
well , he did things to earn it .
uh , what i mean is ...
do things , things he wasn 't very proud of .
afraid not .
did he do something awful ?
can you stay for some tea ? it 's been so long .
yes . yes , we do .
because i thought you 'd want to know .
so you could do something .
that i know nothing about the man i 've lived with for 27 years ?
i didn 't know .
but thank you for painting so vivid ,
you 'd want to know .
then i owe you an apology ,
what is ?
how the hell did he do that ? !
oh , he 's never gonna quit now !
i don 't know , buddy .
probably gonna be out the rest of the season .
hey , but you know what ? that was one hec@@ k of a hit .
and now he 's in witness protection for life .
he said it was because he thought it was the right thing to do .
i don 't know .
what you 're telling me is if ..
a good man has to die .
a friend of mine should be along there shortly .
just to see where you are with things .
nothing is going to affect tomorrow ,
he 's there at your disposal if you need him .
talk soon .
we don 't know that .
we tell her that kid got away you and i , we are not here now .
what is that supposed to mean ?
pushed pen@@ cil@@ s.@@ drank coffee all day long behind a desk .
you wanna pay me to work ?
i scru@@ b one more tray ,
sign me up , then , baby .
as far as i have to .
i wanna talk to him directly .
if he wants fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i , he 's gonna have to .
no , you heard me right
you can probably tell just by looking at me ,
you know , the big event .
since pron@@ zo was the only one not in his office ,
thing is , sometimes it takes weeks for the marsh@@ als service to set up a new identity ,
i called the phone company said i was pron@@ zo and i 'd lost my bill .
mrs pron@@ zo was receiving dozens of calls from an area code a long way from chicago .
well , i 'll give you some qu@@ id pro quo .
who took this picture ?
so who 's it gonna be ?
yeah , you should be careful with who visits you in here , fish .
" in the race toward worldwide peace and prosper@@ ity@@ .@@ america will set the pace . "
can you think of a word with a worse connotation ?
did you send me a baby
i am vice president of this country .
i know exactly who you are .
there is something you need to understand .
i understand that .
all i 'm saying is these guys are into this thing now ,
sebastian bal@@ four ?

ladies , i 'm sorry .
but even if you dis@@ approve , we hope that you will respect our right
no , i think we 're ready for her .
why can 't i go ? i play golf .
edi@@ e , me and the guys have only two rules for these weekends .
fine , be that way .
hey , golf balls .
who cares ?
buy a dictionary !
you aren 't joining the lynch mob ?
no , no , no . you cant do that . you 've got to pick a side .
i am now running for president , against you .
i don 't think it 's a good idea .
if you want to save the tree house , why don 't you let me run instead ?
i 'm sorry , i didn 't catch that .
look , this is not just about a tree house or a fountain .
do we get to make our own choices or do we let the taste police
no , this is about personal freedom .
hey .
so i was hoping you could help me .
i would love to , but ...
i just wanted to know if she was happy .
well ,
anybody besides lee ?
i just want to remind everyone that a vote for ka@@ therine is a vote for fascism .
" fascism , " ida , not " fashion . "
let 's kick this pig . all in favour of ly@@ net@@ te ?
that 's fourteen for ly@@ net@@ te and fourteen for ka@@ therine .
no , it 's not . susan voted twice !
you only get one vote , sweet cheeks . who 's it gonna be ?
she seems fine to me .
mah@@ jong . don 't see that much any more .
these people are your new friends .
wait , i thought i couldn 't go there . you said it was just a party school .
but ; no matter , you 'll be happier here .
wh@@ oa , when did i get a convertible ?
oh , look , they have water aerob@@ ics .
you should sign up .
i mean , for the baby 's sake . how can i support it without a degree ?
can 't you just say that you like having me around ?
hi . what 's going on ?
so here 's the deal .
oh , i don 't think i like where this is going .
from thinking about me , what ?
wait , wait , wait .
i don 't want you to .
how do you know how to do that ?
you 've ruined me , you know that ?
god , you have the most lus@@ cious pus@@ sy in all of chri@@ sten@@ dom .
remember , you 're not looking for merit .
we seek only im@@ perfection .
tell me what you see .
in the classical world , it is the warrior ,
because there is only a man of god , not a man of gods .
there is no other god
the stones themselves have their own view of things .
they were pip@@ ed up out of the earth in a time before any witness was .
let me show you .
although , i suppose every diamond is cau@@ tionary .
it 's not a small thing to wish for , however un@@ attainable
to enhance the beauty of the beloved ..
we announce to the darkness
he was taking it rather poorly , i have to say .
maybe they have more practice at it .
of course , anybody who thinks he 's the smar@@ test .
would that be me ? no , no .
you 're not the straight dude people think though , are you ?
i don 't mean the cap@@ er , i mean you . women like you .
do you know what they like about you ?
right !
the paradox .
you 're sh@@ itting me .
it 's just that there 's no easy way to turn the thing off , or reason to .
all right , i 'm in . and thanks .
i won 't say , " i hope you know what you 're doing " because you don 't .
you keep telling yourself it 's not as bad as it appears ..
increasingly .
this will dry up , right ?
that 's the thing rein@@ er doesn 't seem to get .
that wouldn 't include the present one , would it ?
no reason . sorry
you want to know why jesus wasn 't born in mexico ?
couldn 't find three wise men or a virgin .
what was it you wanted to tell me ?
oh , boy .
he was coming to see me .
speeding
what , he couldn 't pay the fine ?
how did you find this out ?
don 't know .
200 . yeah .
that 's not a speed .
you 're telling me he was going 206 miles an hour ? in what ?
listen , if you could get his money back .
he 's not getting his money back .
we had enough fun for one evening .
and get rid of the hall@@ way , yeah .
yeah . all right .
that 's my boy .
i won 't be able to get what the kid is saying . is that okay ?
did you get it ?
so , she does this full split
like , no , i 'm sitting there reading my email .
and then she tells me that she 's going to come .
one of those cat@@ fish things . you know ?
i mean , it was , i don 't know ..
because of that ? no , not that .
yeah , i guess i 'm in love with her , but
es@@ a@@ eful death
i don 't know
i know
good . i 'll see you at the club .
yeah . it 's got arizona plates .
now the shipment is missing ...
client ? he wasn 't a client .
then all i can say is you 're wrong .
it 's what you 're taking down with you .
but my phone is out and it 's my kid 's birthday .
yesterday . why ?
because i couldn 't reach him now , all right ?
i don 't know .
that 's what we@@ stray said . but he did know , didn 't he ?
i 've got some money . i don 't think so .
i might . oh , yeah ?
sure . same as you . greed .
i tried to appeal to your greed two years ago .
it 's too late .
they just don 't know how stupid .
maybe it is .
you think there 's still space enough to make the decision , and then there isn 't .
greed really takes you to the edge , doesn 't it ?
when the axe comes through the door ..
that 's fair enough .
they try to sell it at auction maybe , maybe not .
hey , welcome to america . huh ?
there is no one to talk to .
i have no suggestions , counselor .
we 're meeting now .
but i do , counselor .
and they 're all different
please keep your bags with you at all times .
i like the hat .
what would be the point ? he 'll be broke .
or is it worse than that ?
you already are .
but he won 't , will he ?
okay . last one .
let 's see how it goes .
hello , ms. hel@@ ler . this is austin hamilton
i 'd love to help you out , but unfortunately ,
i 'm taking your diploma .
that 's the only doctorate you 'll ever get .
you said i 'm not using my space , so ...
okay , you need to move now .
you can 't stay there forever .
give up , w@@ olo@@ witz .
there is nothing you could possibly do to .
because you 're a pillar of health .
doesn 't the wine make the cow drunk ?
gl@@ oria !
you know she 's not here , right ?
she 's having her hair blown out .
that i pay for ?
then i get mad and tell her to hurry .
so i promised myself , no matter how late she is ,
just now , in the rest@@ room down the hall . he turned around and
yeah , baby . i wish you 'd met her .
because it 's depressing . you don 't wanna go .
no , grandpa palmer 's dead to me . that 's like a figure of speech .
he 's gentle , like mom used to be .
snakes are your constant , but st. patrick , not st. francis
were you there ?
maybe you 're right .
you 're standing in one of the last great cathe@@ dr@@ als in this country ..
for the consequences of your actions .
head north . stop when you get to indi@@ an@@ apolis .
ke@@ ttle corn and the world 's largest steer .
oh , i forgot . wait , wait , wait .
want me to tell you what causes that , ma 'am ?
but who 's out guarding the dou@@ gh@@ nut shop ?
i 'm sorry about your mom .
mysterious ways .
you 're invited . of course you are .
see you there .
i want you to know that .
yes .
eric wouldn 't know a baseball if you threw it at him and it hit him in the head
he 's drinking .
i was at the cour@@ thouse . he forgot gus 's name .
easy .
he thinks he runs this town , don 't he ?
wait , wait , no , no .
come on , mother@@ fuc@@ ker !
you guys have a low opinion of judge palmer ?
so let me guess .
bad skin mu@@ ff@@ in-@@ top or red bull semen breath ?
maybe just my closed fist , counselor , in my own personal space .
that 's a metaphor . i heard it . it 's good . you 're funny .
get some counseling .
yes ?
maybe i 'll buy you a drink .
his wife just died . why wouldn 't he take a swi@@ g ?
better yet , a voluntary urine sample . there you go .
a bladder full of courtesy coffee ...
might catch him off guard .
sure can . nice work , sheriff
trust me , i 'm gonna be back fast as i can . it 's a personal matter .
karen , hold on .
i remember the morning he got out .
pit@@ ching scouts had started to come to his games , from c@@ incin@@ nat@@ i , saint louis .
it was about 50 yards behind her house .
dad gave him 20 years .
i need my walk .
your biggest mistake , and you just happen to run him over ?
but no , no , routines are important . close the door . go .
i don 't remember any of that .

filing the motion out of time ,
this trial happens right here in carl@@ inv@@ ille .
sheriff , after you arrived , what happened ?
and at that time , did you offer any assistance ?
so no ?
mr. palmer stated he drove his vehicle
okay .
and did you see ... ?
and the evidence presented by mr. dic@@ k@@ ham
see you folks in court .
" agreement from the gi@@ pper 's coach , " 10 letters .
come in . sit down .
sit down .
easily ...
for a change of venue ?
for every two people who stand in front of you , one wins , one loses .
yes , yes , yes .
said he 'd assist a more seas@@ oned attorney .
are you asking if you can represent me ?
i remember being there at the mini-@@ mart . i needed eggs .
i turned around , stopped at the light on state .
show of hands .
wil@@ lie hel@@ son for president . "
" certified breast inspector . have them out . "
unless i drop you down the escal@@ ator !
it 's been a long time . i waited a long time for this .
you 're the first grand@@ daughter i ever had .
i think grandpa 's sweet .
okay , all right .
yes .
there you go .
oh , maybe i 'm gonna str@@ angle her .
man .
i love seeing you here
honestly ?
that i 'm a phenomen@@ al lawyer , that i got a work ethic that 'll rival the am@@ ish ?
and you 're just a boy from indiana
i 'm gonna go play with myself . i 'll be thinking of you .
fuck !
you can sometimes suffer from memory loss ..
he 's getting chemotherapy in a fishing cabin .
bound by his wishes or his vanity ?
that 's up to him .
but .
what are you doing ?
what are we doing ?
we 're fixing the sink . it leaks .
no , there 's water all over the floor .

you 're making the turn all by yourself . good girl , good girl , good girl .
best vacation ever .
you gonna be all right ?
hey , daddy .
it 's a coincidence .
june , july , august , september , october , november , december , january ..
here we go .
but bottom@@ -@@ line this for us : what do all these numbers and percentages mean .
it 's the victim 's blood on the car .
no , sir .
no . h@@ one of that .
people wouldn 't sit near him in church .
i can 't say , " best . "
him knowing would just complicate things .
in order to move on , and we did
that it was fine with me when you left to go to that god@@ damn concert
that you 're the only one who 's gonna get hurt when you run away again ..
oh , i know that look .
i never asked you for a god@@ damn thing .
you cannot lose this case .
don 't pat me . don 't pat me . i 'm the big brother here . you don 't pat me .
not you , gl@@ en .
i killed the bast@@ ard
i know me . i ran that man down .
you 're not capable of overriding a lifetime of ethical superiority .
not even your late wife .
but now a man 's blood , a man that you hate
i do not . no
but you 're in the dark about it all .
you 've altered your route ..
and he 's in a ra@@ vine with his kid@@ neys rup@@ tured and his back broken
so you 're telling this court .
a man you released .
on the worst day of your life .
i watched him cry right there .
i wanted someone to help him ...
if he lost his way .
that someone . is that so mul@@ ch to ask ?
i have memories .
you , me .
how come ?
i looked at you and i saw him .
last question : this man 's been your bail@@ iff for 22 years . what is his name ?
either that or you cheated on me . either way , it 's not fine .
and the thing is .. listen .
here it is . i met car@@ la at the ta@@ vern . blind
he who 's her father ?
he was broken , he was sweet , he was almost normal . i needed a little nor@@ ma
i love how you are simultaneously ...
i love how you hate a bully while you 're being one .
on the charge of murder in the first degree ?
and on the lesser included charge of voluntary man@@ slaughter ?
order
as i am required to impose an appropriate sentence .
i am therefore sentencing you to serve four years in state prison .
deputy , please take judge palmer into custody .
correctly identify hom@@ er simpson and the town in which he resides .
but when you put 12 americans together on a jury and you ask for justice ..
often as not , they get it right
and you went easy on her .
well , you know , when you lose ...
and when you 're on a streak , you know , you just .
sign here and here to take possession .
yeah . too warm ?
yeah . we 're thinking of having it on a cliff

i 'm just pon@@ dering the implications .
again , i can read the sign .
which suggests either a remarkable passi@@ vity among the , i assume ,
oh , i don 't know if i must be , but yes .
oh , dr. bever@@ ly ho@@ f@@ stad@@ ter .
oh , you 're a hand sha@@ ker . interesting .
i 'll walk you to the apartment . oh , all right .
you know , i 've always been curious .
oh , i think you mean young .
right , okay .
you 'll have to be more specific .
five .
an out@@ mo@@ ded theory , of course , but the boy did spend
well , that is one of my degrees .
well , i 'm an actress .
what do you mean why ?
yeah , i don 't know what that means .
nothing . mother likes looking at brains
she 's only been here a day and a half
you can 't let her get into your head .
it 's too late for me .
she was right , you know .
oh , yeah , there she is . hi , mom .
no , they said i was too per@@ ky .
you know what i used to do when i was little
your mother told me .
anyway , that 's not what i was gonna say .
a hu@@ gging machine ?
you know what the sadd@@ est p@@ ant was ? what ?
your scan data will be very helpful to my research .

holding .
i 'm looking at it right now . our boys haven 't come up yet .
colonel , stand by .
then they cut off each finger at the joint .
i 'm talking about mercy , tyler .
we 're talking about a kid , g@@ asp@@ ar .
with a price tag of ten million on his head .
you 're a mercenary , right , tyler ?
aren 't you sick of this life ?
my name is captain k@@ len@@ z@@ endor@@ f .
captain k .
this is fr@@ il@@ ein ra@@ hm .
so a little about me . who am i ?
oh , yes , that 's a wonderful idea .
will someone get this kid a gun ?
get in line , kid .
okay , here 's the situation .
but then you 'll tell on me and my mother ,
and if i tell my mother i know ,
it 's just a normal stalemate .
oh , god , you 're right .

we 're concerned that they will find him before we do .
we want to help him .
we 're your solution .
you needed someone to take it out of your hands
your choice is between us
he just doesn 't want it .
we make that kind of mistake .
your agents and contacts were compromised .
and all that damage
you ever ask yourself that question ?
m@@ m@@ m-@@ hmm , sometimes .
and what is it ?
isn 't that enough ?
just because you 're russian ,
where did this money come from ?
you 're an honorable man , i believe that .
we must trust each other surely .
it belongs to a man who has done great evil .
i wish to be free of him .
the sins of my father .
i believe you feel lost ,
only then will you be truly free of this burden .

the struggle against terror is too important

as prime minister , he always had good instinc@@ ts .
but the .
ar@@ ca@@ dia ?
very high@@ brow . no reason why you should have heard of it .
what can you remember of him from cambridge ?
no , not at all . go ahead .
no one 's mentioned the cambridge connection between us in all these years .
it was the summer rev@@ ue . i can 't even remember what it was called .
is that what i think it is ?
but that is you standing behind him , isn 't it ?
and i do believe i 'm on the point of issuing a stern warning to him
if so , i would prefer it if i weren 't named .
no , if you don 't mind , let 's not return to cambridge .
get hold of mr. lang 's when they appear .
i doubt that very much .

i was trying to help her , and we .... well , we kind of hit it off
yes , but they make me uncomfortable .
sorry about that .
uh , what else did she leave ?
well , where did you put them ?
the keys aren 't here . so she probably has her keys .
she has the key@@ tec@@ tive key service on her key chain .
it 's a little thing that goes on your key chain .
anyway , i told me@@ gh@@ an about it . she thought it was sensible .
she was really scary .
yeah .
all right , kid . come with us .
but when we find her ,
get in the back . be happy that you 're coming
what ? no . i wouldn 't want that even if she 'd agree to it .
it 's " officer . " " driver " ? what , your dad rich or something ?
't shut up , i 'm going to drop you off right on this corner .
god , i just want to find my bike !
oh , my god .

let me do all the talking . no , opposite , opposite .
this working girl 's sinister sp@@ ree
t@@ n other news .
i ... can 't read this story because i know that it 's not true
well , that was quick . did you get properly fed ?
sure . we 'll see .
i just need my agent to call me back .
and we may disagree on what is considered fascinating .
why do you have mo@@ st@@ ly-@@ used toilet paper rolls in the cabinet in your bathroom ?
there on the end .
you 'll be a very rich man .
i want to talk about it now !
well , that 's not unusual , our grandmother and grandfather were first cousins .
here , jersey girl .
so , you still have a balance , miss israel .
but she 's really sick and she 's very old .
didn 't you people take a hippo@@ cratic oath ?
god . wow .
all right , i have $ 14 .
no , we need half the balance .
okay . just these .
i don 't want the others .
i just don 't want to carry them around anymore .
i told you i don 't want the others .
you know , you don 't have to be so dis@@ respectful .
just get it to me soon .
uh , hey , in the meantime ,
good afternoon , darling .
can i have a beer , pretty please ?
lee israel ?
last time i saw you ... thank you .
am i right ?
you 're friends with , um , julia some ..
yeah .
so , what do you think ?
i could give you $ 75 .
it 's a bit bl@@ and is all .
well , do you think you could pay in cash ?
i 'm glad to hear you 're writing another book .
did you hear tom cl@@ ancy is getting paid three million dollars
i mean , the p.@@ s. makes it pric@@ eless .
so , one of each , twice a day , in her food .
it 'll stabilize her .
oh , no , no , no .
yeah , it 's awful . i mean , there 's dead flies everywhere .
thanks .
i fear i must decline your invitation as this weekend
welcome .
i 'm aware that you sell memor@@ abil@@ ia and first editions .
yes , all of that .
wondering if these might be of interest to you ?
my cousin was a collector .
you clearly don 't know me very well .
come on ! spill the beans !
i have no one to tell . all my friends are dead .
i can 't fa@@ tho@@ m what criminal activity you could possibly involve in ,
libraries ?
how much are you getting for them ?
it 's a waste of a secret .
who else have you told about this ?
no . i remember you had someone .
why ?
unlike you , i prefer to put my money to good use .
i just thought we should do something .
" baby won 't you say you love me "
but if you are tempted , make sure you do your homework .
some care more than others about getting the real thing .
that one .
you run your mouth too much .
too much .
let 's go to your place . come on .
oh ! it smells horrible .
what 's going on in there ?
miss israel .
thank you for those cookies .
ms. israel .
so , what do you got ?
she had quite the mouth .
liked the ladies , too , i heard .
i assume so .
and people love this stuff .
that is fucking old . what 's that in cat years ?
ms. israel , i was wondering if you could come in tomorrow ?
please come in or call as soon as you can .
thank you . thank you for bringing it in .
what seems to be the problem ?
and he said that ..
it was illegal in those days , and ...
i 'm shocked .
you mean , your cousin ?
i 'm not gonna do that to you . i 'm a good guy .
i 'll lie .
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
that 's very generous of you .
you 're a clever woman .
oh , hello , welcome .
my grandmother just died , and .
and i discovered these when i was going through her closet and
oh , yes .
i guess i 'm not really up on all these things .
do you think it 's real ?
good .
you brought it back , right ?
you left it there ?
stop calling me an idiot .
i 'm just gonna kill myself first .
lee , come on . we can 't stop now .
maybe you could steal more real ones
fair enough .
i 'm a very private person .
you 're right ! that 's a great idea .
i 'll take the apartment upstairs .
if you catch my drift .
i 'm sorry , that really is how it works .
you tell me the truth , what do we get ?
you get to choose between a mountain bike or a ps@@ 3 .
please , you look cute .
i think you look fantastic .
oh , yeah , be careful .
he 's upstairs at al@@ icia 's .
he said he 'd help me set up my printer , but i guess i can wait .
in what i can only perceive as a tactical move to destroy me ,
hmm , typical .
they never went upstairs to visit the former tenants ,
oh , great ! now , i have to start all over again .
cool@@ . so are you in a lo@@ ft now ?
purely plat@@ on@@ ic@@ . she 's also my maid .
i won 't li@@ e. it 's pretty d@@ ope .
hey , i just wanted to bring you a little house@@ warming gift .
come on in@@ . let 's open it. great .
oh , this ? i 'm dressed like a slo@@ b today .
i 've never had such good-@@ looking technical support .
that is so awesome .
yeah , i know , tell me about it .
that 's why i work at the chees@@ ec@@ ake factory .
al@@ icia , what do you want as your default setting for dv@@ ds
well , d@@ ts has more low end , so ..
i don 't care .
you know , penny , there 's something that
when this happens ,
that i 'm like the old queen of the hi@@ ve and it 's just time for me to go ?
they 're on the discovery channel .
bees .
gee , penny , thanks for buying us dinner .
even though the menu description specifies sh@@ red@@ ded ? yes .
you stop at the korean grocery and get the good hot mustard ?
did you pick up the low-@@ sodium soy sauce from the market ? yes .
see how it 's done , leonard ?
no , no , p@@ ms is different .
i just got a call@@ back to audi@@ tion
but my car is in the shop .
i 'll run lines with you in the car .
and afterward , il 'll take you all out for chinese .
yum@@ . starving .
they 're gone , penny . they can 't hear you .
i mean , anything she wants , they go pan@@ ting after her like trained dogs .
you once had leonard and me get your television from your ex-@@ boyfriend .
as a nation , we shared their agony .
it 's time !
all right now .
should we come back later ?
oh , please . it 's all right . it 's your day .
we 're good .
so in recognition of that ,
1@@ e can ' . but he dd
i just wanted to say that
that 's a debt i 'll never be able to repay .
shut up .
you two have a very simple task .
he threatened to kill my family .
okay ? people that i need to protect .
kat@@ n@@ iss , what were you thinking ?
it 's appalling
i 'm the head gam@@ e-@@ maker . fun is my job .
sen@@ eca decided to quit breathing .
being head gam@@ e-@@ maker has never been
same reason as you . i volunteered .
ambition .
well , maybe it was you who inspired me to come back .
kat@@ n@@ iss , come . the president awaits .
two young people who embody our ideals
your love has inspired us .
look at them .
she 's not a leader
and she has to be eliminated .
at the right time .
kat@@ n@@ iss ever@@ deen is a symbol . their moc@@ king-@@ jay .
then we let the people do the rest .
gh@@ ut down the black markets .
who 's gonna be there ? fear .
show them that she is one of us now
we need to talk
if we leave right now ,
you 've given them an opportunity .
there 's already talk in the mines . people wanna fight .
they will kill us .
get out of my way !
how about i shoot both of you ?
trust me , i 'm trying to help you .
you could live 100 life@@ times and never deserve that boy .
nobody decent ever wins the games .
there 's no winners .
we have to do whatever it takes to save him .
a guy like that has to know she 's not gonna make it .
well , kat@@ n@@ iss , i just hope when she goes , she goes quickly .
how 'd we get here , huh ?
i mean , who cares about them , right ?
well , if we see something sweet , we better grab it .
any secrets worth my time ?
everybody always seems to know my secrets
i 'm sorry you had to cancel your wedding
hmm . he 'll have to get in line .
no waving and smiling , this time .
that should be easy .
friction generates heat .
you should move your hands downward
thank you .
f@@ plu@@ tar@@ ch ?
thank you for being here tonight
and we will never see anything like it again .
tonight will be their final opportunity
oh , don 't go crying on me now , caesar .
you know i wouldn 't believe you , even if you did .
but , kat@@ n@@ iss ,
aren 't we , folks ?
yes , president snow thought everyone would want to see it .
was he not , folks ?
don 't you love it , folks ?
well , actually , we got married .
a secret wedding ?
we@@ .we want ou@@ lr love to be eternal
and i wouldn 't have any regrets at all
all right . this is news ! let 's find out more .
and so you shall , my darling . so you shall .
the force field .
we couldn 't find any signs of fresh water .
we 'll be safe with our backs protected . we should set up camp .
not a chance .
the hour 's gone . the hour 's up . it 's all right .
no , no . pri@@ m 's okay .
pri@@ m ! tin@@ d pri@@ m !
are you okay ?
okay ? they won 't touch pri@@ m . all right ?
if they tortured her or did anything to her ,
what if we . what if we set your backyard on fire ?
here 's what i propose .
that should draw them back to the beach .
anyone in the water or on the damp sand
because i invented it .
well , it 's better than hunting them down .
if it fails , no harm done anyway , right ?
i think we need to go .
i think so , too .
i don 't want to be the one that shoots first .
they 're not gonna make that same mistake again .
and it 's gonna be one of us .
moves and counter-@@ moves
let 's get started .
we don 't want to be anywhere in the vicinity when this hits .
then head to the tree at the 2 : 00 sector .
i 'm gonna go with them as a guard .
and the tree .
there are two careers out there . i need two guards .
why can 't tin@@ nick and johan@@ na stay with you
it 's his plan . we all agreed to it .
thank god he 's keeping quiet .
you with that ginger ale of yours , pretending it was champagne .
could 've been a shoulder to lean on ,
the day of judgment is coming , brother .
slice and dice . show him we nasty .
come on .
i only ask that they give me a second chance .
why should we think this time is different ?
is two-@@ face gone for good ?
a ru@@ sty trap .
come in here where it 's warm , mommy .
i need you , mommy . talk soft and make me feel safe
do@@ g-@@ e@@ at-@@ dog world , i guess .
what the hell was that
oh , man , oh , man . start already .
come on , we 'll cut through here .
i heard the m@@ tants hang here .
what ? what happened ?
i got my nine . anything moves , i 'll .
repeat , all units ,
forget it . we 're gonna lose this one as it is .
what the hell is that ?
go to their car , kid . get the loo .
i don 't believe this . it 's not in their car .
and right now , i 'm the only one
commissioner , something you have to see .
he set it back up ?
at east a dozen . then why ?
the guy 's a fascist . no regard for civil rights .
it 's like all that marching we did never happened .
give me another hit of that , will you ?
you made sure , the doors are locked , right ?
not letting anyone see him .
what did he do to himself ? you don 't suppose he
i wouldn 't rule out that he 's hurting himself .
we still talking about dent ?
it 's bigger than that now
they 're next on my list . but first things first .
the go@@ tham life building .
look at me and have your laugh .
nothing can change what i am .
i think it 's a mistake to
batman ? i think he 's a-@@ okay . he 's kicking all the right but@@ ts .
i 'd i@@ ke to see him show up for my landlord next .
we have to show patience .
one moment , i 've just been handed this .
do like we said . you got one hour .
hold your breath . once we get the ransom ,
chill , spot . it 's just a bat .
should have got out of the way , spot .
my men , my country , that 's all i cared about .
my wife
you sent them enough fire@@ power to stage a small war .
leader says everyone , so get in .
not talking speeches , man . talking war .
they don 't even wait for an order .
bub@@ ber bullets
it 's just a shell to keep you safe ?
captain y@@ inde@@ l stands firmly against the batman
what do you think , tr@@ ish ? has the mayor gone nuts ?
but the war goes on .
your training begins tomorrow
alter my plan in any way , stray from my instructions at all
yeah , i figure that real cool , rob .
leader say that , but leader in a cell , don .
ch@@ eg@@ s pre-school mu@@ tant .
yeah , right . you leader 's squeeze , i figure .
but you 're welcome to wait here .
you 're a good cop .
truth is , you 've been a hero of mine since i was a kid .
make it sound like we leap@@ t to our feet
rumors were flying , we barely had an army .
commissioner , you better see this .
you 're done for tonight . how do you know it worked ?
no , i think you do understand , matt .
matt , if your wife dies ,
age like anyone else .

if he doesn 't respond in six hours ,
bra@@ in-@@ dead .
what about a miracle ?
i know . you 're right , miracles happen .
that 's why we do a series of tests over a number of hours .
that there isn 't gonna be any miracles .
to stand around as surgeons and not cut .
i wish he 'd just go into the light
it 's depressing .
and somebody se@@ wed this tear in his shirt .
he belongs to someone .
no . and nice eyes .
i like a man with kind eyes .
i mean , uh .. you can , um ...
because i 'm enjoying the view .
he 's stable .
he has a traumatic aor@@ tic injury .
he needs surgery .
if he 's gonna live .
i say we do a little digging .
he was always very slowly solving crimes .
g@@ ret@@ chen .
bravo !
hey , dad . you know how kids te@@ ase me

i don 't blame you for wanting a little peace and quiet .
she found this on her kitchen floor , and it 's not aspir@@ in .
she says it 's a narcotic , and it 's highly addic@@ tive .

for years , you have told me that my father is too evil to talk about .
regardless , i am still your mother ,
are you gonna sla@@ p me ain , kick me out of the house ?
i 'm sorry , mom .
oh , but this isn 't the same th@@ ing.@@ mike wouldn 't lie to me about this
he said there were no more pill@@ s.@@ i was looking him in the eye .
i can 't believe i forgot that .
there 's a hole in it .
when we head home you can have it back .
b@@ ree as much as you like .

i have what may strike you as a very odd request .
he says we should do nothing and let the child decide when he 's grown .
we should pick our religion ?
well , he 's out of town , and .
and if i don 't do this , my grandma .
will never forgive me , may she rest in peace .
that whatever your husband says ， you are promising to raise your child as a dev@@ out je@@ w :
i woke up , and you were gone .
so why stop there ? wh@@ y. why not cut off his testi@@ cles ?
or@@ son .
going behind my back , ignoring my feelings on this ?
i don 't have any room for her .
there it is@@ . the " i have a family " card .
dave and i are just separated .
well , we can 't just throw her out on the street .
okay , we all have our excuses , but we gotta figure something out .
is she ?
i was just trying to talk to you , see if we still had a chance .
and what the hell is he doing on my boat ?
that was a big mistake , buddy .
yeah you 're the guy that said if anyone mess@@ ed with your woman ,
so , why don 't you let me
i mean , if penny finds out i 've known all this time
and i wish leonard never told me .
i guess that 's true .
compared to that , who cares if i bought
really ?
is there any kind of discount for length of marriage ?
okay .
but the show must go on .
anyway , let 's not spend any more time talking about her .
tonight 's theme :
$ 250 an hour . why ?
bern@@ ade@@ tte and i have occasionally gone to one to ,
dude , just because we 're best friends

we got to keep our eyes pe@@ eled
mar@@ j@@ orie , 12 : 00 .
quick , pretend we 're having a fight .
asked if i was trying to look gay .

i can 't talk right now , mom .
i 'm at a dance , and a boy likes me .
why are you talking like that ?
excuse me , hi . hey .
what ?
i 'm married . my rear end is at home .
oh , no . she 's way too intense .
the first girl lever kissed was at a high school dance .
let 's just say the lion did not sleep that night .
mar@@ sha gou@@ l@@ ding .
finally got my nerve up to ask her to the spring fling .
i was just so surprised she kissed me back .
oh , what the hell . give gl@@ oria a thr@@ ill .

you think she didn 't know
we 're here to copy the card .

but you know how sham@@ eless i am in
money makes time .
clock time accelerated the rise of the capitalism .
measurable hours , man hours
what is the measurement called a nano@@ second ?
it belongs to the free market system .
it is being suc@@ ked out of the world to make way for the future of

this is also a hallmark of capitalist thought .
old industries have to be harsh@@ ly eliminated .
destroy the past . make the future .
assessment , credible red . highest order of urgency .

she got me a beautiful notebook . told me to go write my novel .
a kite
anyway . year four , flowers .
two years since september . we used to live in new york
why did you all move back here ?
oh , i 'm sorry . how is she ?
type a ?
you seem pretty lai@@ d-@@ back . type b .
god , i don 't know . i 'd have to look it up at the house .
and you don 't know your wife 's blood type .
maybe it 's type o .
have to ta ke a shower .
you wanna look like you 've been up all night .
that 's a weird thing to say .
please don 't say , " like dad . "
i 'm the twin . mar@@ go .
mar@@ y@@ beth , i am really sorry .
we didn 't have a lot of choice
should i just go first , and then you guys can say something ?
if anyone out there has any information .
thank you .
should i have said my name ?
she 's bright , she 's beautiful . she 's kind .
you know , there are millions of people out there ..
we care about her , we love her .
amy is a decorated scholar .
you know what ? you 're right .
more games ?
what 's the laptop for ?
you are spending a lot .
you certainly don 't trust my intention .
because it 's easy to throw .
i don 't get why you 're daring me to be someone i don 't wanna be
i 'm sorry .
i fli@@ pped bur@@ gers , i painted houses , but .
no money , no jobs , no prospects .
mama ma@@ ure@@ en .
so , we moved to missouri .
nick is happy to be home .
i feel like something he loaded by mistake .
something disposable .
oh , my god !
okay . sh@@ h .
rehear@@ sals
i needed to see you .
can you at least tell me you love me ?
why do you ask ?
" and so dedicated , can long endure ... "
i told her it 's not my thing
are you sure this is her ?
she was all in pink .
for valentine 's day , i thought i 'd buy a gun .
nick wants me gone but he won 't ask for a divorce .
you 're a liar and a cheat ! you 're just like dad !
she 's one of my students .
how fucking terrible she made me feel
this is so bad
where , occasionally , an@@ die and i
tann@@ er bolt , would you actually consider defending nick dun@@ ne ?
as always , ellen , thank you for such a warm welcome .
listen , just because this guy isn 't walking around weeping
you need to hire tann@@ er bolt
that 's exactly what you deserve .
hey , buddy .
we 're not gonna arrest anybody .
one , i am conducting an investigation , not a wit@@ ch-@@ hunt
we don 't know who or what was scar@@ ing her , gil .
no drug angles pan@@ ned out yet , so cross that off the list .
the guy 's a bast@@ ard , but he 's weak as a kit@@ ten , so cross that off the list .
hey .
i do ! you bought great clubs .
this is identity theft ! this is a fel@@ ony !
all right . let 's talk about life insurance
and my lazy , lying , cheating , obli@@ vious husband
he took and took from me until i no longer existed .
let the punishment fit the crime .
you be@@ friend a local idiot .
credit cards , perhaps online gambling .
bump up your life insurance
you need to package yourself so that people will truly mour@@ n your loss .
as if it 's so hard to spread your legs .
if he likes girls gone wild , she 's a mall ba@@ be ..
when i met nick dun@@ ne , i knew he wanted cool girl .
i wa@@ x-@@ stripped my pus@@ sy raw .
i ate cold pizza and remained a size two .
i lived in the moment .
i can 't say i didn 't enjoy some of it .
a ligh@@ tness , a humor , an ease .
i inspired him to rise to my level .
we were the happiest couple we knew .
but nick got lazy .
he actually expected me to love him unconditionally .
okay . you know where i 'll be
least you could do is not keep his secrets for him .
he 's trying to watch the big game and you just won 't shut up .
i got it .
well , right now , it 's a " he said , she said . "
so , we need to start today to prepare your defense , should we need it .
then we 'll need to real@@ ign the public 's perception of amy .
and see her for what she is , which a min@@ d-@@ fuc@@ ker of the first degree .
there has to be someone out there that she 's scre@@ wed with in the past .
eight years ago , she pressed charges against him .
ex-@@ classmate , des@@ i coll@@ ings .
i meet amy at this party , you know ?
she 's beautiful , she 's smart , she 's well-@@ read
girls like a fix@@ er-@@ upper , but amy ?
paid the ultimate price .
he never introduced himself .
i think we know why .
a little harsh
don 't get me wrong .
i 'm just saying , there are consequences .
she was so alone .
you 're a good friend , no@@ elle . and you 're a good friend of the show .
number of times he visited last year ? one .
his twin sister , mar@@ go , well , she is a peach .
playing what , lau@@ ren ? playing house ?
what kind of moral rot
can i bu@@ m a cigarette ?
and you know what else we won 't forget ?
amen .
hey .
mr. coll@@ ings .
i wanted to help .
i got your address from this letter that you wrote my wife
she was my first serious girlfriend
you stal@@ ked her , you threatened her .
your wife is missing , and you came all this way to tell me this ?
mr. coll@@ ings .
" he 's gonna kill me . " the end .
it 's private . there 's no one there .
because he tri@@ pped the alarm . you were up his ass with a flash@@ light .
she does the treasure hut .
she 's taking us on a tour of my in@@ fidel@@ ities . rubbing my nose in it .
which will lead them back to my office .
and she leaves a pair of red pan@@ ties
my father 's house .
they 'll go after mar@@ go .
she 's your accomplice . she helped you hide the evidence .
god .
we find amy .
i 've got two ex-@@ secret service guys that are really good .
but where do they start , nick ?
i have no idea .
hey !
he 's nice .
n@@ ope
this is a tic@@ king time bomb . you 've gotta throw yourself on it .
and then , they will forgive you .
people em@@ path@@ ize with that .
sharon 's speci@@ als , they get 10 million viewers .
i will drill you as if you were doing a deposition .
a trained monkey ?
nick , this case is about what people think of you .
now , you do this and you will reach millions of those people .
was the only thing that 's kept me going these past few years .
i 'd be a par@@ iah . everyone would hate me .
he should go to prison for what he 's done .
it 's utterly seclu@@ ded .
you know why .
t met nicholas dun@@ ne .
why is she dressed like a bab@@ y@@ sit@@ ter ?
of having been roman@@ tically involved with a married man .
i truly believed we were in love .
i know that is no excuse .
i do not , in my heart , believe nick dun@@ ne would have killed for me .
i apologize for the pain this has caused them .
come on , you 're staring at ghosts .
we now absolutely believe .
our amazing amy .
we 're gonna have to bow out of this .
an hour ago , we were ahead of this . now ?
when we got married , i promised to be that guy .
that guy who , who lives and acts .
if she is out there , able to hear and see you tonight ..
amy , i love you .
come home .
regardless of what you thought ..
i think we can all agree ...
there 's more to him than meets the eye .
they dis@@ liked me , they liked me , they hated me .
a can@@ dor and an honesty that 's worthy of respect .
what is it ?
girlfriend 's real cute , nick .
i have treated you more than fair throughout this entire investigation .
every time you said something stupid ...
are these the clubs you don 't play golf with ?
none of this was put here by me .
everything just waiting until the wife goes away for good .
shall i read the last entry ?
" this man may kill me . "
jud@@ y 's missing handle .
we found this day one , in the fire@@ place in your home office .
we bag@@ ged it .
we just tested it . fire doesn 't erase blood , nick .
you 're under arrest for the murder of your wife .
what about my side ?
more coffee ?
did you notice that it was packed
he hid a lot of stuff at go 's . they 're very close .
by a man with a history of mental problems ?
des@@ i assaulted me that night .
he tied me up like a dog
please find this . please find the tapes .
how did she manage to get a hold of a box cutter ...
can 't you just be happy your wife is home and safe ?
it contains many concerning allegations of mental and physical abuse .
nick didn 't want a baby .
but i love him .
i 'm sorry , i feel myself fading
and i 'd be tied , still , spread@@ -@@ eagle
we prayed to god , and god has answered our prayers .
i 'm not pretending
you do know i was just telling you what you wanted to hear , right ?
you know me in your marrow .
you killed someone , amy . you 're a murderer .
i fought my way back to you .
she told me she killed des@@ i
yeah , because she had me strip naked , and stand in the shower .
and i specialize in fuc@@ ke@@ d-@@ ud .
you should pitch that as reality television .
nick and i have been through some bad patches .
but we thank you so much ...
she 's good .
the real house@@ wives of bran@@ son .
i can 't believe you 're just leaving now .
we should hold hands .
so , nick , how does it feel to have your wife back ?
how many people are lucky enough to get a second chance at love ?
" amazing " ?
i 'm gonna need those three things to feel safe .
don 't worry . i know exactly what to say .
the thing is that i 'm a lick strap@@ ped at the moment .
your rules .
but when i bend them just a little , we have to se@@ ver the partnership .
prohibition , claude , means no liquor .
that man stole my horse .
you tell him to get a gun on his belt . at sund@@ own , we 'll square this up .
sund@@ own .
it 's a time-@@ honoured tradition .
i had to get to your injury , eh ?
uh ... uh , sir ? that is not an area that bra@@ ves infection with grace !
get out@@ ta my way . ill shoot ya . when any stranger could be the end
no . no , no , no . i 'm only saying
pardon my idiot partner 's ru@@ den@@ ess .
and some delicious ground nuts ?
very well , mrs. taylor . now , you have to give me
no , i need ' em now .
y es . well , all our apparel is purchased on order .
they stock soap .
so do i absolutely need a shear pin , or can i just use a nail or something ?
talk has it that you 're the montana kid .
says here you killed six men .
you don 't look like a kid . nick@@ names have a way of sticking .
i guess so .
sund@@ own .
the town hasn 't seen this much excitement
what 's wrong with you people ?
and he might like my shot@@ gun best .
where the hell are you from ?
up@@ psal@@ a . any of you got a hog leg like this ?
well , does anyone got one ? m@@ m-@@ hmm .
uh , what do call it ? a peac@@ emaker !
there 's just not much call for one around here .
a mou@@ th@@ piece .
come on .
oh , yeah , yeah , you 're right .
that 'd be the shorter straw ,
oh , no , ma 'am , no .
well , then why don 't you do that and run along .
mou@@ th@@ piece .
wh@@ oa ! pardon me .
hey , mr. montana , please ,
general stores sell cough medication . idiot !
i need a part for a gun .
not that many . it 'd be a miracle if he gets off one shot .
.. it 's a nice spot .
it 's where i 'd come when stewart got drunk .
and when he got real mean , i 'd just pull the ladder up and wait .
.. he 'd say that i wasn 't even worth the effort .
not even worth the effort to beat .
well , was he right about you ?
be@@ atin ' on a helpless dog ?
.. there sure as hell is no reason ...
or santa fe and ...
if i was so damn smart to walk away
just beat him up .
" taught a common thief a lesson , " he said .
common .
he was my pa .
... i@@ ke it or not ,
and i am what i do .
oh , miss ad@@ ell ,
you go home . but ...
i said go home now .
you did a hell of a job , i 'll give you that .
put it in your belt .
you 'll blow your nuts off .
o@@ oh .
ow ! ! ! there 's more in there .
doc ! what happened ? !
you shot jack ? !
i 'm dis@@ figured ! yeah , i.@@ i know . i 'm sorry .
except if you kill her ,
already checked in .
what 's it to you ?
so don 't let him open his mouth .
this is a time table when we can access them .
if you sit here , you have the best view .
that 's your call .
aren 't we supposed to talk ?
a line between the el@@ bows .
perfect , and .. morph@@ us .
more like you 're holding a bird or something .
they just put her things in shipping boxes .
i don 't care what happened .
i 'm really worried .
kom@@ men sie .
gu@@ ten mor@@ gen .
okay , well , let 's meet soon .
i 'm almost out the door .
it would make any of them insane .
and it 's good for su@@ sie to see us like this .
maybe she even senses what we want of her .
you can see her eyes shine with it .
when i send her our dreams .
i know who i am !
it 's okay .
it 's just a nightmare .
i 'm surprised it took this long .
sorry , i don 't see this .
only ..
and patricia , she did spoke of ..
actual rooms that are secret .
in porcelain , these very fine things .
patricia said that , uh , mar@@ kos
do they believe they 're wit@@ ches ?
that 's religion .
the reich had these things .
es@@ o@@ ter@@ ic ritual .
i don 't know .
patricia could still be in ..
well , i don 't need a baby , jack .
yeah , need a drink .
percentages are not science .
you need instinct . and hear you just lost that .
says he 's available for the morning shift .
said maybe you should go and see him ,
you and joke about that , but some of the guys are concerned .
no as@@ sh@@ ole tourists on board .
that 's 25 dollars .
her husband arrived on a jet decorated like a cake .
gave carlos 150 for finding champagne at 10@@ am .
going after s@@ word@@ fish again ?
we will .
i don 't like them going over to that kid 's house .
mm , x@@ ander 's a bad influence .
huge st@@ oner always walking around
i mean , come on .
but i only told one person . it was too ju@@ icy .
this is from long@@ ines .
i cannot believe he betrayed my trust .
do you run background checks on your employees
look at her . what is she doing ?
excuse me . sir , hey !
let 's go .
the starters are at the gate .. and we 're ready to go .
what the hell ?
i 'll go talk to the manager .
100 % we 're all there@@ .@@ card 's all there .
it 's all your fault !
here come the cops . you better go before you get recognized .
i 'll take care of it go ! go !
let 's go !
hi , there .
i was wondering if you could help me .
okay , um , listen .
yeah , well , you asked one too many .
why don 't you help me find somebody
all right , well , um .... .
excuse me ?
did you see that one ? yeah .
what are you doing ?
what do you mean he got arrested ?
it 's a long story ,
what do you think , that every time you guys screw up ,
can you do it or not ?
excuse me.@@ who are you ?
keep your voice down@@ .@@ okay ?
you need to sign those so i can collect ro@@ land 's device .
yeah , you knew the deal when you came on board .
you want to flush it down the toilet
self got the de@@ vic@@ e.@@ mah@@ one 's still in jail .
so if the general has a problem , he can call me .
i think we got off on the wrong foot .
what 's that ?
oh , yeah , what 's that ?
as easy as that ?
said you were spotted with another male cauc@@ asian
here come the cops .
what was it ?
grab as much cash and get out ?
i 'll take care of it . go !
all right , let 's talk about the fifth card@@ holder .
now , sc@@ ud@@ eri has major security around his house .
where are the documents ?
it shows the layout of his property .
and that 's how we 're getting in .
look , i know what the score is@@ .it 's every man for himself .
now , i signed on the do@@ tted line
you know , maybe
i mean , i don 't know .
i think he 'd finish what he started .
can i help you with something ?
i just have some things i need to take care of .
you have this ... switch inside you .
shut yourself off .
did it with me .
if i was capable of being her mother ,
bye , emily .
peru ?
i leave two weeks after graduation .
that 's awesome , kay@@ la .
oh my .. jesus .
everybody , stay back ! okay ? stay back !
i can 't steer it or stop it . and the under@@ min@@ er 's escaped !
it 's a super@@ hero 's playground .
you know , after we went underground ...
waiting for something to happen .
oh , i 'm such a hypo@@ crit@@ e .
" everyone 's getting the sleep that they lack . "
and i 'm willing to admit
sure . you 're making life easy for them .
i know the chief of police . there won 't be a problem .
if you alone had handled the under@@ min@@ er .
i 'm just saying .
on budget and ahead of schedule ...
specialized motor@@ bike ,
i 'm telling you , honey , it was a saga !
and on your first night !
i 'm proud of you , honey .
and you 'll be amazing .
thanks for handling everything .
i love you , honey . i 'll be back soon .
but now , with you being you , i feel like ..
flew them in from all over .
they have powers , secret identities ...
i 'm scre@@ ech . it 's a pleasure .
well , thanks . you 're too nice .
nice to meet you , brick . uh , where are you from ?
and trace its origin .
airport ?
super@@ heroes are part of your brain@@ less desire .
you don 't talk , you watch talk shows .
travel , relationships , risk ...
and delivered to you to watch at a distance .
ever passive ...
who can 't bring themselves to rise from their cou@@ ches .
you want super@@ heroes to protect you .
while you tell yourselves you 're being looked after .
and your rights are being upheld .
smiling at you all the while .
you are no longer in control .
find anything ?
what happened ?
what 's going on ? what did i do ?
that 's right , punk . blame the system .
you 're a genius .
i think i just need a little bit of me time .
oh , you need more than me time , bob .
which leads me to an important announcement .
leaders from more than a hundred
we 'll gather super@@ heroes and leaders
yeah , i invent the stuff , he 's good at people .
l never know what people want .
ease .
it may be cra@@ p , but hey , it 's convenient .
my rates are far too high .
he is bright and i am stimulating .
you saw those go@@ gg@@ les they put on luci@@ us .
they 're all under someone 's control .
okay . bad guys after us .
no luci@@ us .
and .. what ?
this country raised you .
and this is how you choose to repay it ?
and so ,
sentences are to commence
a rise
let 's talk about this , man , alright ?
i like my cells clean as a plate
step away from the gr@@ ille .
i could get used to this .
idiot
walk . walk
no . this is .. this is good .
can i ... ?
we 've heard about you .
eight for me . 12 for him .
hold on to that anger .
nobody said stop . move !
one for each slo@@ p , my friend .
come on . get it over there .
something 's weighing you down i think .
one of these mor@@ nings
but you 're part of a movement now .
ja , so help us .
you don 't even know how many there are .
if they 've got a lock , we can make a key
we can go to mozambique and from there to tanzania .
hey ! you show some respect !
alright , that 's enough ! i suggest that from now
we should turn and follow you now ?
are you my conscience ?
you know that !
every day we sit here , we justify this regime
hey , alright ! alright !
rob .
we said that we 'd put it out of our minds .
i can 't . i 'm sorry .
well , in here , it 's now .
why today ? why is it pre@@ ying on your mind today ?
a news story ?
i printed it for you .
what ?
oh , it 's not that .
no , i like him . he 's ... flu@@ ffy .
it 's just we 've got a lot going on , what with ali and ...
the pet shop guy was ok . it won 't be a problem .
they may not be totally accurate , and they 're often emotional ,
oh , i 've got something that might help .
the accident happened a few hundred meters
no si@@ pping , just take a sni@@ ff .
oh .. that 's familiar .
getting something now .
seems to be real .
t@@ g 6@@ 14 , business class .
no alias ?
worked as a supervisor at a coffee plantation , big one it seems .
he 's definitely not an office worker .
who knows , maybe we 'll get lucky .
uncle , two of the usual , please .
what would you like to drink ?
yes .
like when people say i look like
shel@@ don , this is not a big deal .
not me
e@@ atin@@ g-@@ ca@@ ke-@@ on-the-@@ toilet single .
i have no choice but to confront her .
hang onto it until you 're in trouble
that 's terrible advice .
well , of course not .
well , no , no , he 's over there .
so , what 's the deal with your apartment ?
um , it was a dry@@ wall problem .
well , the dry@@ wall got wet ,
or damp wall , just as bad . mm .
well , they went to get some ,
i was done at wet wall , but you wouldn 't let it go .
you see , i 'm not in the habit of speaking to people vert much .
talking to people is extremely peril@@ ous .
it 's about furniture that belonged to my parents ' villa .
i understand
so what ?
i 'm out of my depth .... what 's the word ?
does mr. ol@@ d@@ man already have the pleasure of knowing you ?
perhaps i didn 't make myself clear
in his opinion , the best .
ladies and gentlemen it gives me great pleasure to present lot 231
one million one hundred thousand ! one million two hundred thousand
one million eight hundred thousand in the room !
two million euros ! at two million euros !
at two million euros !
two million five ! i can sell it ! two million seven !
any more ? are we all done ?
sold ! congratulations , sir .
in all honesty , no , never .
what matters is that you 're satisfied .
the love of art and knowing how to hold a brush doesn 't make a man an artist
in all my thirty-@@ six years in this business .
it 's a disgrace an appalling display of bad manners !
i tried to call your office never come near me again ! do you understand ?
i do not possess a mobile phone !
she was hit by a car as she was on her way to meet you .
she was lying in a pool of blood when the ambulance arrived .
yes ?
i had no intention of being in any way dis@@ respectful .
no , fortunately they 'll let me out tomorrow .
that the object plainly hadn 't been there vert long
hi robert , did you manage it ?
this works perfectly now
count on it . can i give you a kiss ?
good evening .
um@@ ber@@ to ver@@ ud@@ d .
is this part of the house inhabited ?
there 've been some changes i don 't know what ..
be that as it may , if your mistress has not materi@@ alised by mid-@@ day
f@@ hello ? mr. ol@@ d@@ man ?
i don 't know how to ap@@ olog@@ ise . i don 't know what you must think of me , but
is that clear ?
you 'll find it sig@@ ne@@ d.@@ i accept all your conditions ..
the phantom of a silly superficial woman !
i can quite understand your ex@@ asper@@ ation , mr. ol@@ d@@ man ..
it 's been a series of unfortunate unintentional mis@@ haps
which police station did you go to ?
who do you think you are ?
what do you mean ? what kind of question is that ?
i don 't understand
could you hazard a guess as to what it is ?
in the last few years the old couple were both un@@ well .
or later they 'd have to sell something
what else can you tell me about her ?
i don 't really know her at all .
twenty-@@ six thousand on the telephone ! twenty-@@ eight thousand in the room !
thirty five thousand ! thank you , sir .
fifty thousand ! fifty five thousand !
sixty five thousand on the telephone !
any advance on seventy thousand !
you didn 't get in with your bid in time !
the old trou@@ t was behind me . if i 'd seen her i 'd have come in with another bid
but it 's not the first time we 've mess@@ ed up .
i thought young people had more exciting things to talk about .
that 's vert kind . another time . thank you .
bye . goodbye .
so we 've changed our mind@@ s.@@ is that a problem ?
claire l@@ b@@ bet@@ son 's been on the phone .
she asked if you could meet her today , at 2 : .@@ 30 .
how did you know it was me ?
to be honest i didn 't expect you 'd want to speak to me .
if i were you , i wouldn 't either
i hope not too ti@@ res@@ ome
why do you systematically avoid meeting me ?
a person who arou@@ ses such deep-@@ seated aversion in you
if i didn 't believe you i wouldn 't be here playing hide and seek .
it 's been a long time now
if there 's somebody wandering around the house or in the villa
but why ?
it 's a simple question of hygiene . i don 't see the connection .
these seem to me vert similar personal choices .
i see you know my age .
perfect . but i see your personal details are missing
personal details never expire .
i was just a girl then but it 'll do for your purposes .
i understand .
i 'm disgu@@ sted by people who don 't trust the colour of their own hair .
sir , there 'll be no more caretaker service as from monday .
why give them to me ?
when you come in , slam the door .
but not impossible .
if they 've been together long enough ,
absolutely .
exactly . she lived for years locked up in an apartment , on her own .
yeah well , what did i tell you ? now he 's gonna be constantly worried about her .
now it 's beautiful , isn 't it ?
there you are , mr. ol@@ d@@ man .
how 's our toy coming along
well , maybe . but we 've never seen our android .
so is he
good evening , mr. ol@@ d@@ man . it 's claire l@@ b@@ bet@@ son .
no , not at all , miss ib@@ bet@@ son .
you 've done a great job really you have
what would you advise ?
why did you decide to sell in the first place ?
all of the above , i suppose .
well , that 's it . next time we 'll do the paintings .
one last thing , claire .
better in a studio , i don 't want too many people around the house .
i can 't believe it .
i had to do something to make you forgive me .
i don 't want a penny more than i gave the old girl
when i was your friend , your accomplice
you 've found some really important stuff here !
a big step forward , wouldn 't you say ?
now , look .
how many seconds did it take you to realise i was talking about myself ?
let me confess : i didn 't follow your advice .
okay , i see your point .
the mathematical set of a fifty-@@ one minute hour .
tea , please
the edge of a circum@@ ference . the centre of space
the vertical position of a sphere .
cast your eye over them carefully because you 'll have to author@@ ise them .
i know , you 'll have to trust me miss l@@ b@@ bet@@ son .
were you offended at being locked out ?
claire , you 're ru@@ ining your life for reasons which are beyond me .
even my mother thought i was fa@@ king it the first time .
i started screaming and fell to the ground .
has there ever been an open space where you weren 't overcome by anxiety ?
i was fourteen
our autom@@ aton is about to emerge from the shadows .
it 's just that
the regard i have for women is equal to the fear i 've always had of them .
well , if that 's the rule then
and what strategy would that be ?
take a gamble , run a risk .
as long as you 're playing according to her rules
t don 't know
perhaps the smaller size ?
lam@@ ber@@ t. are you married ?
what 's it like , living with a woman ?
you never know if yours will be the best offer .
what do you think ? have i made myself pretty ?
you@@ l 're a liar .
i haven 't done this for centuries
ah , maybe we did get the last moves wrong
robert ! my aunt 's gone missing again !
beg your pardon . we found her in the central park .
she can wonder off as far as she likes now you 'll never lose touch with her .
i can manage that . you are an angel .
i 'll see you tomorrow night , yeah ? yes
maybe you should invite her to dinner .
then at the romantic clim@@ ax of the evening , by candle light
well , if you want to invite me why not ?
well , who said anything about jo@@ king ?
thank you .
eight hundred and thirty-@@ one point three three , three .
you 've done a wonderful job vir@@ gil
to your seren@@ ity , claire .
and now i feel i can finally tell you .
but i warn you , as a waiter i 'm not of the highest class .
1@@ '@@ il take the risk
because if the service were not to be to your liking .
a child loses his parents a horrible orphan@@ age that sort of thing
do you know , in an old article of yours i found the other day on the internet
often it 's just a tri@@ fle a detail of no interest
you couldn 't have been more convincing
well , if i didn 't know about her problems
no , really . i liked her .
if you want my advice , vir@@ gil ..
mr. ol@@ d@@ man , do you want lots 87 and 88 done separately ?
how can i help you ?
what 's going on ?
all those girls ho@@ vering around him ..
is there anything i can do ?
i don 't understand
i feel so stupid .
i promise .
if you 'd phoned i wouldn 't have kept you waiting
one of my assistants will come by to@@ day@@ . as it is
i think i 'm at least due an explanation , aren 't 1 ?
it 's weird seeing them all so perfect and polished up .
i believe nothing is missing
it still is . it always will be .
you have to get out of here . and you have to do it by yourself
i 'm telling you ...
did she have any friends , y '@@ know people she could 've gone to ?
if she 's gone out she can 't have gone far .
one hundred and fifty thousand gentleman on my left !
one hundred and seventy thousand !
two hundred thousand gentleman on my left in the room .
two hundred and fifty thousand on the telephone !
robert 's looking further a@@ field . all right .
all right .
three hundred and ten thousand euros ! any more ?
vir@@ gil ,
thanks , robert .
what do you hope is gonna happen ?
someone with her problems doesn 't just disappear into thin air .
it doesn 't matter how deeply rooted it is
maybe something happened between you two .
you know perfectly well that 's impossible .
i 'd never have gu@@ essed that you would have ended up in a mess like this .
all you had to do was listen .
i 'd say .. i don 't know
with her that he carried her off by force .
i 've had my doubts lately about robert .
literature , exactly .
she could have had her own reasons for disappearing
i wouldn 't be so sure , if i were you .
they seem just like the original
y '@@ know , just like on the first day .
i want to co@@ ax her out .
she 's too fragile .
hello ?
vir@@ gil !
hold it up !
why do you say you don 't love it ?
let 's go back inside .
yes , but the plan was never realised except for the inaugural reception .
i too have an important announcement to make .
it will be the finest of my career .
they say he 's been seen recently in female company .
so , it 's finally come home to him that the worst sexual per@@ version is ch@@ asti@@ ty .
that 's nice of them .
any@@ how , i 'm happy , claire . i just wish you were here
don 't let it get to you.@@ we have all the time in the world to travel .
have you heard from our young friends ?
i 'm never left on my own if that 's what you 're worried about .
i can hear you 've got to go .
i know , but she did this amazing thing for me .
i 'd feel a whole lot better if i knew that she was on board .
we 'll be quick . kare@@ v .
okay , what is that about ?
do another loop there . beautiful .
i have a good teacher .
don 't be a pig .
well , the th@@ ong is un@@ professional .
you all sound really old .
and i know sometimes i don 't listen ,
ready to listen ?
you want to hear what i 'm saying and really take it in
also , it 's funny when they fall down .
he 's doing fine . his spine 's been stabilized ,
his recovery will be slow and painful .
this was supposed to be the best day of our lives .
with the horses and the ... bag@@ pipes .
we don 't get marriage in washington .
we get to go to city hall
so call me crazy , but ..
and i fought for it .
stood in the cold outside the state@@ house .
i know this sounds really confusing ,
okay . i 'm going to yoga .
oh , you should go with her , gl@@ oria !
i would love it . bye !
i don 't even know why i try .
oh , well , that 's just claire , you know ?
you gotta break through those walls .
you really think so ?
forge that friendship !
okay , thank you ! i 'm just gonna lie here ...
i knew for a fact claire never returned my tu@@ p@@ per@@ ware .
and when i did ,
oh , hey ! i thought you were going to the pharmacy .
i think i 'm just upset about this stupid thing with my dad .
waiting till i 'm 40 when she looks me up on facebook
what are you doing ?
it 's time to make her notice you !
we got a full tank of gas , and she 's right down the block .
i 'll know .
she was such a sweet little doll .
i 'm having trouble adjusting to all this .
no , she 's broken .
it happens . dol@@ ls grow up .
oh , i understand congratulations
you 've come a long way this past year .
well , now that you 're here , i guess we can begin .
what 's going on ?
well then , why risk it ?
i just have to make sure the security we 've put in
i , uh , don 't think so ,
the way they treat you , you 'd think
no , i 've been invited because i 'm the last of
it 's complicated .
and do you remember what happens uh , when you
but i still don 't understand . i mean ...
it 's not logical . how ?
look , i know it doesn 't look like much ,
now , at the push of a button , we 're able to ...
wow .
well , what about that third one ?
what would happen if he was freed ?
i 'm looking to do more i think i need to
what ?
come on .
okay , are there any windows ?
you 're letting him get away !
back off
what the hell was that ?
the sword is a fake .
ru@@ gal 's going back in .
ch@@ iz@@ uru , it 's just a game .
if you don 't mind , it 's time for my father to rest
the highest form of goodness is like water .
it stays in places lo@@ ath@@ ed by all men .
in choosing your dwelling ,
we make a vessel from a lump of clay
thus while it is the tangible has advantages ,
hor@@ i !
where have you been ?
i didn 't mean to worry you .
i mean , you just disappeared .
code blue ! code blue ! get me a crash cart , stat !
and you 've sent out a warning to the fighters ?
excellent .
they don 't know they 're playing
i 'm up .
no one 's supposed to accept challenges until
i 've never heard of two fighters
there 's a first time for everything .
i don 't know . something 's wrong .
i knew you two would have .
who are you ?
i 'm the king of . fighters ! ru@@ gal !
you can 't change the rules .
i can do whatever i want .
yeah , i just got out of the tournament .
ru@@ gal has improved the gameplay .
you should totally do it ...
well , the cia can 't do that anymore .
you want to tell me about this ?
i 'm cia
it 's too bad the sword was a fake . nice try .
i just want to know where he is .
let me guess , he 's hiding in your
is that so ? then why do you need me ?
other dimension , king of tooth fai@@ ries .
people are dying ...
and you want me to believe you and your crazy stories ?
who 's mai ?
oh , that mai .
if you don 't believe me , go talk to her .
you know we 're wasting our time here .
it can give you great strength and power
is that why you left ?
what did you do to my father ?
my father was completely un@@ responsive for 10 years ,
it 's about our families .
you still haven 't told me what it is you 're you 're doing here .
what sword ?
what about what lor@@ i said ?
your boyfriend didn 't tell you ?
all right .
he wanted to be the king of fighters and harness its power .
so the clans united , and one of my ancestors killed
well , it 's happening again . that 's why i 'm here .
oh ! here we go with the dimensions bull@@ shit .
dimensions , dimension .

that 's it . that 's it .
no , i 'm taking you off the case .
he 's taking you off this case ?
tell me something , mai , is there anyone in this room
well , i came to stop you .
come on , let 's be honest , you have issues .
well , i got my issues under control , but , uh , you , um ...
well , you just going to stand there
and it begins .
there he is .
that 's the spirit .
you know its power , what it feels like .
together , we can be inv@@ inci@@ ble .
i don 't know , a place where i can be me .
can you ?
i 'm looking for a lot of things .
i need your help .
he gave you the name .
i repair motorcycles , i 'm not a hero .
you don 't even know what you are .
you did what ?
i trusted you with that . she trusted me .
so if there is some other dimension , like you say ,
ch@@ iz@@ uru ... thank you for coming .
she trusts me .
ru@@ gal is becoming more and more powerful ,
these dimensions exist in what could more
you see , ru@@ gal was able to get access to
hey ..
she 's in there .
you had the sword this whole time ?
look ... you bar@@ ge into my life
it 's here now , and i 'm ready to go in .
i know .
i will .
i 'm strong enough .
please .
you don 't even believe in orders .
show us how these things work , sco@@ tty .
what are you doing here ?
what do you think , i 'm just going to leave you ?
ch@@ iz@@ uru ?
for a while there , i thought you wouldn 't make it .
i am king of fighters .
this world is all i need .
this isn 't life .
when my world expands and mer@@ ges with
i 'm inv@@ inci@@ ble .
not as long as we have the sword .
where are you ?
do you know what this place is ?
it was your father 's favorite setting .
my father would never hurt me .
come on , this is boring .
i don 't know@@ . too violent .
hey , this is more like it .
terry ?
oh , man . maybe you did travel to another dimension .
learning , for oscar , will be a slow process .
day after day , it takes a committed mom to teach him
a gathering storm exc@@ ites scar 's forces .
this damn thing is so uncomfortable .
we 're in marriage counseling , b@@ ree .
this is business .
boy the movies ever get the wrong .
you 're very tense .
find a way to rel@@ a .
do i have to go ?
by the way , you won 't be drinking at this party .
no , but , god , you should have seen the look on his face .
i mean , he 's coming to the party , right ?
oh , he 's not going to come . big surprise .
god , i hate when i get that way .
you know what ? it 's not going to change until you resolve your issues with that man .
yeah , but i can see her little mind working away .
come on , ashley .
i don 't understand . why do we need private sessions ?
oh , well , i don 't have any personal issues .
okay , i know what just happened is funny in theory ,
uh , susan had a problem finding something to wear .
pretty much .
well , i 'm sure you can figure a way to put them to bed , tom .
in college , when we first started dating ,
everybody knew we were going to have this wonderful life .
because you can 't even let me pack my own suitcase .
hey .
it 's good to see you again , e@@ than .
there 's a microwave tr@@ acker in his neck .
let me just assure you , this won 't hurt
you and your apost@@ les think we 're gonna trade you
" your mission , should you choose to accept it . "
while every day the master you serve moves one step closer to ending the world .
sixty seconds .
i 'll do it my way .
enough games . i 'm taking you out of here .
he 's gone to the meeting , with a copy of you .
call the apost@@ les . warn them .
for their safety and mine .
they 'll know as soon as we leave the building .
i haven 't finished with hunt yet .
then the per@@ vert got obsessed with me .
so i stole the painting , you know ,
this house is incredible .
yeah . u@@ gh . sorry .
you don 't need to do that . you don 't need to apologize .
you don 't need to be sorry for anything , ever .
thank you .
thanks . yeah .
i just didn 't think i would end up a single mom ,
i put half of that away for miles ' college ,
yeah .
fucking have to pay for everything .
we bought it during the bubble .
here . cheers to being house poor .
m@@ mm . what ?
it 's just another one of my bad decisions .
is that a charity symbol ?
it 's a nice contrast with your ring .
or maybe you can get her to start .
i 'm sure it 's 5 : 00 somewhere .
he 's such a brilliant writer .
not enough , apparently .
oh , i figured you 'd want a break
what 'd she tell you ?
and i called her office ,
i mean , i 've played through
i 'm flying back tomorrow .
yeah . she has a very high-profile job
what are you implying , exactly ?
something to make you run off to london ?
you leave town , your wife takes off .
excuse me , that 's very rude .
i have seen him with his wife , let me tell you ,
well , that avenue is a dead end , so you can drop it .
she doesn 't have any .
i 'm sorry , i didn 't know that .
her name is emily nelson .
emily 's not in today .
especially the powerful ones .
listen , you bargain basement tom ford ,
because if you lose m@@ oms , you lose business .
number two , tom ford wishes he were me .
you 're ..
better pray i don 't have a bru@@ ise .
look at our little steph@@ an@@ ie .
is this a game , like when you smash everything with trucks ?
i 'm not lying ! i saw her ! fuck you !
i 'm sorry .
of course you do , swee@@ tie .
it was because of you .
it 's probably the most responsible thing we ever did .
move in with me .
just you , me and the boys .
i love you , steph@@ an@@ ie smo@@ thers .
hi , m@@ oms . this is steph@@ an@@ ie here .
but i do think that we live on after we die , so ..
and you 'll always be nick@@ y 's mom .
i can just try to love the people that you love
okay , guys , it 's getting too rough back there .
not me . i came back to life .
okay , the dol@@ ls are going in your back@@ packs
you 'll see nothing but smiles .
hi . i 'm looking for the m@@ clan@@ den foundation .
who 's this ?
i 'm the director of the squ@@ aw lake bible camp .
well , we are putting together the 50th anniversary
she 's quite a woman , your mother .
you met my mother ?
we had a little walk down memory lane .
bet you couldn 't do anything right in her eyes .
but then , all the bad ideas were faith 's , weren 't they ?
for fuck 's sake .
she 's gotten to you , hasn 't she ?
it 's got everything to do with her .
you go alone ?
obviously , he can 't really sne@@ ak around anymore , so ...
i was thin@@ kin ' , if anyone asks about that fire at rick 's ,
i didn 't start the fire .
if anyone thinks you did , it 'd be handy if y could prove them wrong , wouldn 't it ?
i know . i just .. i can 't stop now .
well , um , as much as i appreciate this naked display of emotion ,
really ?
no . never .
oh , sure , you can .
i simply picture an empty box , and i take whatever i 'm feeling and put that in the box ,
in private , like a lady .
i 'm gonna try that .
prove me wrong , swee@@ tie . prove me wrong .
okay , carlos , here 's the harness .
how do i get ro@@ xy to fetch it for him ?
ro@@ xy doesn 't do that .
i get that , but surely she 's trained to do other stuff ,
don 't ve me your blind sar@@ cas@@ m .
do you have one of those ?
really ? well , for a dog who 's supposed to help us , she sounds kind of limited .
it 's not your favorite ?
excuse me . i have to put something in a box and stick it in the closet .
got it .
uh , which is why i haven 't told her .
well , when b@@ ree and or@@ son were staying with us ,
no , this was the next night .
but like i said , he was asleep , so it 's probably nothing .
he said .. " i 'm sorry i ran over mike . "
he didn 't even know you when that happened .
yeah , that 's what i figured .
we don 't need any more drama in this house .
how 's the move going ?
no , thanks . we 're almost done .
let me just run something by you .
as@@ hy@@ s@@ asha g@@ or a call today from a couple who loved our work on the founder 's ball .
yes , and they want to hire us to do their anniversary party .
we could be . think about it .
well , w it 's a cherished recipe from catering by ka@@ therine .
this is sham@@ eless emotional blackmail .
and .. it worked beautifully . i 'm in .
but she 's been so good .
i 'm giving her a treat .
fine . one treat .
so i guess that means you won 't be getting your hair done anymore .
just picture the middle one all by itself .
but since you love her so much , i 'm gonna keep looking .
i 'm not sure .
oh , that 's ...
it 's just that i have so many questions , and ...
and we 'd keep this from your mom ?
uh , i think we might be out of candles .
rick .
okay .
you see ? i can talk slow , too .
oh , i think you were busy at the time ... kidnapping his guide dog .
don 't judge me .
we 're fine .
this is our relationship .
not that much . just his eyes .
we have to move .
i know this is difficult ,
trust me , he 's already been there .
he should pay for what he did .
how come daddy 's sleeping on the couch again ?
come on .
mommy and daddy are son@@ t of ... fighting ,
oh , something he did that made mommy really mad .
yes , of course .
we heard daddy say that man wanted to take you away from us .
it 's to always bring it .
and when did you leave hong kong ?
it had gotten a little difficult with the police on one side
he got into so many street fights that by 18 ,
to go when you 're still a star is very strange ,
he didn 't ever look at people
tak@@ y kim@@ ura was really his best friend .
he was five years older than we were ,
we both attended the university of washington .
and then when we were both done with our classes ,
in the rest of the country there were no inter@@ racial marriages .
my mother was not thr@@ illed when we decided to get married ,
that didn 't mean the ban lifted in people 's hearts .
the bigger guy equally
he would just put it down no matter how big you were .
whether bruce lee was a great fighter or wasn 't a great fighter
i made that as a joke , of course .
every time i said it at that time ,
as a kid , we watched green hor@@ net for him .
he had a fly car , i 'll give him pro@@ ps for the car ,
a lot of st@@ unt guys didn 't know
with him , it 's boom , boom , boom , boom ,
thats something i can really
the beauty was that he immediately said ,
really ? you didn 't like yourself ? i didn 't see it .
martial art has a very ,
he really did read
he had a huge library of
as an actor , as a martial artist , as a human being ,
and you can take most of the passages from that book
was how can i most efficiently
the other stuff was hollywood .
do you understand ?
and that 's not to say that it can 't be passed on .
our main event , for the light heav@@ y@@ weight title ,
how does it differ from , say , our kind of boxing ?
second to none .
oh ! beautiful elbow !
you name it , man , we use it .
i mean the .. everything , i mean , not just the hand .
there 's no debate .
i do think ther 's a correlation there ,
in 1963 you 'll see gene
and he was out , like ,
i 'd throw him and flip him and
and he was a magnificent athlete .
he 's before anyone else .
that bo@@ thers me .
and if you don 't believe me , i 'll choke you
people get pis@@ sed off and bombed out and everything else .
he was so directed and
" the right punch comes .
yourself ?
and did that part , just expressed myself like i say
was he too ?
you 've had everybody as your student .
i don 't know if you remember them .
i said . this is what it is ok
now , you put water into a cup
you put it in a te@@ ap@@ ot , it becomes the te@@ ap@@ ot .
be water , my friend .
bruce lee plays a working-@@ class hero .
but at the same time as that , he 's never one of the guys .
bruce lee completely changed
it 's a ballet . in terms of
they chop ' em up so much .
i was living in miami when they came out .
i would spend hours wh@@ ipping
it became like a household product .
after i watched this movie , i used to use that .
right out of the gate i swung
and after that i stopped making the noise
i got into it because i stopped carrying a gun .
i 'm not ashamed to admit it .
this one particularly is senti@@ mental for me .
he wants to put a little more
and he was adam@@ ant he was not going to the set .
he could lose his temper .
linda was that fab@@ ulous wife .
i was talking behind the
let me think .
and they 're all better off , the world is better off ,
enter the dragon was hollywood 's first di@@ pping its toe
the opening scene , bruce lee
i haven 't seen any actor in an action film
destroy the image and you will break the enemy .
this is the moment that he was waiting for .
bruce was in a studio doing du@@ bbing for enter the dragon
and he was unconscious and i was talking to him ,
ted wong used to always tell me ,
he had just had a collapse .
he told me that he 'd had an ok from u@@ cl@@ a that his body was fit .
bruce lee faces a real dilemma .
so what does he chose , the east or the west ?
i was called and told by raymond chow ,
everything took too long a time .
and i remember turning to
what 's the emergency ?
where ?
where do you think ? on mars !
yeah , baby , i 'll be right in .
yeah , i picked her up in the bar . she 's a doctor .
wait a minute .

oh , okay . let 's go , friend leonard .
my mother is so gonna love her .
i 'm sorry . i totally interrupted you .
just said howard 's a terrific guy .
he loves his mother ...
people say " too much . "
you know , if you look at the big picture .
are you insane ?
cool .
actually , i was just checking my e-mail .
i believe the appropriate metaphor here
there 's got to be other options .
but based on nasa 's latest timetable ,
oh , snap .
okay , i guess we have to turn to plan b .
erase all the hard drives , scrap the surveillance tapes ,
will you all excuse me ?
no . yeah , i remember specifically .
well , that does sound like me , but no .
yeah .
all right , good-@@ bye .
if anyone asks you where i went , you don 't know .
who would ask me ?
so you brought me in here to inform me
leonard , a moment .

i was never cartel .
my mission was to infiltr@@ ate los cu@@ er@@ pos .
i had to do things .
you need a stronger vehicle , an armoured vehicle ,
there 's a ch@@ op-@@ shop there .
once he crosses the border , we can move in .
come on , you want to get across that wall or what ?
sh@@ h . no , no , no , no . be quiet .
we 're looking for a ride .

you didn 't think it would all be over once we crossed the border , did you ?
there is a grand conductor behind all this .
he dis@@ hed out $ 6 million of taxpayer money
he took a stand and defended our second amendment with a vengeance .
my fellow americans , it 's been a gro@@ ov@@ y four years .
for me , winning was only the beginning .
it 's the simple things that fund
why ?
but given men@@ dez 's ap@@ titude for the unpredictable ,
higher than you could mentally ascen@@ d to .
technically speaking , space shuttle .
it all started about six years ago .
i saw the future
aboard it , me and anyone who wants to join me will take flight .
noah had his ark , i got mine .
i believe what i see .
i see glim@@ pses of what lies ahead .
good luck .
or three ?
cl@@ ones .
just as i predicted .
i created my cl@@ ones because where i 'm going , i 'm going to need an army .
but since you fuc@@ ked him up like a special ed science fair project ,
i need a stronger specimen from which to draw a new batch of cl@@ ones
but what if there were more ?
mac@@ he@@ te , mac@@ he@@ te . every where mac@@ he@@ te !
surely you know by now that i know how all this turns out .
oh , and where will you go ?

god@@ damn , you 're good
my molecule bl@@ aster doesn 't quite work right yet .

we need to find someone to disarm it
osi@@ ris .
he 's not with me .
you wanna choke him out , go ahead .

said he 'd changed his tune .
i know that you would prefer to see me all sorts of dead ,
to finish your brother 's work .
here you are .
ladies and gentlemen , your host , vo@@ z !
and once the world is pur@@ ged ,
but first , my friends , prepare for infin@@ ity !
why don 't you tell them the truth ?

what the hell ?
really ?
i 'm pretty sure they 're gonna take my crown for that .
so , they did in fact know the parenting style of each parent .
obviously it was far from a random selection .
there was nobody in the world like his son .
bobby 's father was very busy as a doctor
.. who was rather strict . he was the boss .
he made the rules and eddy was supposed to follow .
and why do you say it couldn 't have been good ?
this was the last picture we ever had of edward .
he got into all the things young boys do .
i mean , occasionally i disciplined him .
eddy was more ar@@ ts@@ y , kin@@ da kid , you know , he wasn 't into sports .
he was a teacher , he was all about punctu@@ ality .
this ?
uh , so something like ..
no , it doesn 't have a face .
not here . nothing 's wrong here .
uh , well , can i see you tomorrow ?
give me something to work with .
and as i 'm saying this ,
i ripped the middle right out of my span@@ x .

my mom was an alcoholic .
not able to be located by maur@@ y po@@ vich .

hey , everyone has something wrong with them@@ .@@ ash@@ v@@ s@@ ash@@ .com
i think i 'm gonna tell him
max , i think it 's great you were able
that is amazing .
ever since i was a kid ,
and she was a ure@@ th@@ ra that could not shake him .
a gall@@ ant man would defend
well , that didn 't go your way .
i mean , you want what i want .
but what about the other girl ?
i 'll tell her we should just be friends .
penny , we should just be friends .
you think he bites ?
you fool@@ ed me with that goat at the pe@@ tting zoo .
i wonder where dr. lor@@ vis is .
maybe he 's playing b@@ ingo with his mommy .
grab your go@@ gg@@ les , put your lab coat on
why don 't you put her in a ken@@ nel ?
to be honest , she 'd do better in the ken@@ nel .

out of my way , loser .
yeah , but that 's okay .
that 's what i 'm doing .
what is the promotion for insurance apprais@@ er ,
you 're gonna make me throw up . that 's not a real thing .
a place where humans and po@@ kem@@ on can live side by side .
here , we live and work together .
no po@@ ke@@ balls .
from all our citizens ,
hi , tim .
your dad was the best of the best .

i can stop whenever i want .
another round , extra shot .

ready for more to step up !
you give me my re@@ match ,
okay .
hey tim , i don 't float .

yeah , well , my plan 's changed because i found him .
harry is not dead .
that is not proof , son .
harry 's last case had to do with underground battles ,
day 68 .
alert condition red
that must have been how me@@ w@@ two escaped .
i 'll never forgive my hands for what they did .
do it ! do it !
you can drop the act now .
great , by the way . you haven 't aged a day .
is this an intervention ?
okay , when and where did you bump your head today ?
will you excuse me ?
this is your second chance to say yes to his marriage proposal .
you are here because regret has ruined your life .
this is gonna sound stupid .
but my mom made me promise that i wouldn 't , so i became a cop .
but you didn 't ?
when this came around , i figured : " this is my chance to play soldier , "
uh , for luck .
revenge on a childhood bully .
i 'm not sure how you should take a bucket of toilet water
i was having a lot of anxiety , so my mom forced me to go see this shrink ,
anyway , dr. torture ,
i just want to feel what it 's like to be on the other end .
to feel something ?
mr. sullivan , do you mind giving us some privacy ?
in the meantime , feel free to do push@@ -@@ ups or cr@@ un@@ ches .
yeah , that would be a start .
i was talking to you both .
time to make amends for your past and ask for forgiveness .
stop giving this teenage version of her all this d@@ ang power over your life .
god , you two remind me of my daughter .
let 's go .
please , no !

we should 've never come here .
i did everything for you .
it should 've been you instead .
no , i was a dam@@ ned star !
and it was the hardest choice i ever had to make .
no ! i did not want to leave surgery .
i 'm gonna try his apartment .
could you take her home ? she 's had a rough day .
what , you drank too much champagne ?
my boyfriend ran off with the bride .
there was no dancing .
can you wait five minutes ?
and so did he .
i mean , it was hell , but he did it .
don 't bail on him now .
i know what it sounds like when he 's full of cra@@ p .
it took 15 sur@@ ger@@ ies total .
how many people do you know that are unhappy with who they are ?
i 'm not walking out on you .
don 't use him as an excuse for cold feet .
i don 't ! i 'm not ready . okay ?

no chance of that cause of the auto-@@ pilot loop , right ?
can you move that thing ?
no chance of flying over that thick ash cloud .
we 're gonna have to ride it out .
yeah and what do i say ? i said don 't eat the grav@@ y .
just don 't let the old man see you like this .
that cloud isn 't just moving fast , it 's c@@ locking in at three hundred knots !
delta 2-@@ 1 , return to base ! i repeat , return to base !

pick , we need to go .

unfortunately , the day@@ care center 's full .
it 's a popular class , and the other m@@ oms come early .
lau@@ ren , i 'm a mother of four . today i had to get up at five ,
and things like being told to plan ahead make me so crazy
it 's a vicious cycle . see how that works ?
the m@@ oms who followed the rules would get pis@@ sed .
see how that works ?
well , we might as well give the people what they want .
what they do know is ... martha died a violent death .
apparently there was a struggle .
now . i think it 's time that you return to your homes ,
their parents can 't leave london .
so where are you headed ?
i 'm flying officer burn@@ st@@ ow , but you can call me harry .
i 'm sure you are .
really ? and what are you going to do there ?
that 's what they all say .
ye@@ p . all right .
full of character .
mrs. ho@@ gg , dr. rho@@ des , board of education .
oh , don 't worry , don 't worry .
you work for the education board
no lights up here yet , but there 's plenty of candles and oil lamps .

oh , it should be locked .
1@@ t@@ - ' s so cold in here
t don 't know@@ . sad
so when can you send someone round for the repairs ?
well , we 'll make the best of it .
now i lay me down to sleep , i pray the lord my soul to keep .
i don 't know . read
what things ?
oh , i see . psych@@ ic powers ?
with the war ?
i think it 's time we had afternoon lessons , don 't you ?
good day , miss par@@ kins .
family , your home , a memory , a f@@ ara@@ way place .
can we write about the people that used to live in this .
edward , would you come with me , please ?
is that where you found this ?
it 's very , very important that you tell me .
did she tell you to say this to me ?
a ghost ?
was it your mommy ?
leave him alone ! stop being horrible .
a few minutes ago .
you 'll have some tea ?
you 've taken quite a shine to flying officer burn@@ st@@ ow .
no , nor do i
was your husband called up ?
both army families . now our boys .
do you have any photos ?
but you must miss them .
i 'm sorry .
well , i 'm sure they 'll come back to you .
says i 'm the tough@@ est soldier he 's ever met .
but our own worst enemy is ourselves .
despair .
good night , eve . i hope you sleep better tonight .
what do you mean ?
did you speak to them ?
i think you should keep your visions to yourself .
no , you listen to me .
i provided when she could not .
the horse somehow lost its footing
e sank so fast .
you 're too late
you brought her back .
you brought her back . your fault .
i move lights around , make it look like planes are taking off .
i 'm a deco@@ y .
i was , but after the crash ... i couldn 't fly anymore
ln f
which is unfortunate , because i have a fear of nets .
movies , yes .
and remember , he 's more afraid of you than you are of him .
no , i was talking to the bird .
shel@@ don , just ignore him .
oh , much better . all right .
make a pot of tea , leonard . it 's going to be a long night .
for a prostate exam , yes .
i 'm going to the movies with penny .
do you think it 's a date ?
you should !
good ! go ! there are some girls right over there .
they 're in a group . i 'm scared .
you 're bi@@ ologists .
that 's a living thing ; get cracking .
it 's remarkable .
and for what ?
oh , dear .
oh , it 's just like my grandma with her par@@ rot .
my phone 's on the desk over there .
make it good enough to go on a mu@@ g , a mouse pad , and a calendar .
oh . who am i kidding ?
u@@ gh , i am so embarrassed !
what did you tell them ?
fine ? you said it was fine ?
you put it in front of " wine " or " dining , "
it was@@ . okay .
yeah , it 's a perfectly good word .
want a glass of wine ?
you know , have a little wine , take the edge off .
don 't talk , just drink .
how could you possibly know that ?
a precise relationship that is not present
under the terms of my roommate agreement with leonard ,
oec@@ an@@ thus ful@@ ton@@ i .
okay , okay , tell you what .
i can 't take your money .
that is not to@@ by ,
oh , i really don 't care anymore .
y@@ id@@ dish was not spoken in east texas .
yeah , fine , whatever .
we haven 't established that i 'm wrong once . all right .
tell you what . let 's go down
i bet i could throw a rock in this room
if 's like silence of the lam@@ bs down here .
you 're such a girl .
well , apparently , i was wrong .
enjoy ox@@ n@@ ard .
oh , hey , shel@@ don .
old comic book .
what do you have a safe deposit box for ?
i lost this to w@@ olo@@ witz in an ill-@@ considered cricket wag@@ er .
and it 's going to protect me from the crushing force down at the
that 's like having two hum@@ ve@@ es stac@@ ked on your th@@ umb@@ nail
the reason for that is we 'd just rather spend the time at the bottom
so , nature provided an example
it 's designed from the ground up as a science platform .
a sample tray in the science door .
a payload bay for instruments .
every single thing on this vehicle has to be built from scratch
is that it shrin@@ ks over two inches during the dive from pressure .
yeah , it 's still got to go in quite a way .
but we 're also fighting the pressure of time .
how big a problem is that ?
if not , it will be boxing day .
you don 't compromise
i need to have the shot cut right about here . it 's a close up , okay ?
at the core of it is this idea of going deeper and seeing what 's down there
because i knew that in the making of that film ,
pitch black . going to another world .
and it wasn 't a legend anymore .
and something about looking out at that ru@@ sty deck ,
am@@ drew wi@@ ght has tu al ou@@ ur expedi@@ tions since 200
our next target would take us even deeper .
the infamous german battles@@ hip was sunk
the guns are silent now ...
the whole ship somehow preserved in the under@@ world
okay , that could be a way in .
what is your reaction to this ?
to the day .
okay , the camera boom is also wired backwards .
okay . all right . that explains that .
now , be advised temperature is 100 degrees . 100 degrees .
okay , i think it 's time to descend one meter . over .
that 's the big dive . one meter .
well , the compass worked .
this dive will also provide mike
a comm@@ s signal is coming through strong and clear .
200 units and down thrust in . just easing down .
surface , i am on the bottom .
super , super successful dive . everything worked .
in general , that i just .. it just felt wrong to even be trying to co
andrew and mike were like family to me .
it just went ch@@ om@@ p . i was literally inside the ja@@ ws of the shark .
there was just this big rip across the fabric of reality
i think the one thing i 've earned from all of this
don 't put it off till later because it 's ...
safe travels . see you .
but right away there 's so many things to do ,
dee@@ p@@ sea challenger , a comm@@ s mer@@ maid , how do you copy ? over .
we were diving just on the south side of new britain island ,
they call it sub@@ duc@@ tion and it 's because the continents
and the pressure just builds and builds
when that fault slips in one of these deep tren@@ ches ,
we could save a lot of lives if we could predict these events ,
surface , dee@@ p@@ sea challenger . i am on the bottom .
i 'm two-@@ and-@@ a-@@ half miles down , same depth as titanic ,
keep it coming .
i 'll bet they didn 't intend that .
when the dive begins , it 's exciting .
and then you just go into darkness .
and you just fall for a long , long time .
can stretch to there and to there .
i 'm doing it for real .
tl 's cool
my thru@@ sters are running away and they won 't respond .
i think we got a problem .
without thru@@ sters i can 't even stop . this is not good .
everything 's getting hay@@ wire and i 'm getting deeper and deeper .
speed 's 1.9 knots . i still can 't stop from that . i 'll hit the bottom too fast .
i 'm going to have to drop some shot . i 'm going too fast .
and dropping shot , here we go .
oh , shit .
surface , dee@@ p@@ sea challenger . descent is abor@@ ted .
and pretty soon you realize you 're in this kind of dead metal coffin ,
and we 're going to hit hurdles like this where we think
touch@@ down
lights are working
a lot of very happy people up here .
oh , what 's that ?
copy you loud and clear .
all stop , all stop .
this ship 's got to go back .
we 've got to dive , even if it means
and ver@@ ticals d own
i predict we 'll be about ..
a little bit ate , but not much .
we 're on target right now .
there 's of course an element of fear in it ,
i 'm only minutes away from diving the challenger deep
gol@@ dy , a bit more out , please .
here we go .
yeah , copy that , tim . thanks .
hatch looks good so far .
dee@@ p@@ sea challenger , five minutes from drop zone .
dee@@ p@@ sea challenger , surface check .
carbon dioxide is 0.5 percent .
oh , man .
the soft ballast bag has deployed . the hatch pop@@ ped .
yeah roger , i 've got that . i can see that .
and there 's still 9,000 feet to go .
it just gets really quiet .
and you feel yourself just getting farther and farther and farther
time to shed some shot .
35,@@ 200 feet .
get everything on .
let 's get this spotlight aimed down .
100 feet .
i am on the bottom .
and life support 's good .
oh , my cod .
this is how the nasa team must have fe
god speed to you , baby . i love you .
surface be advised , i 'm starting my tran@@ sect to the north . over .
so we have this fantasy that the deeper we are , the bigger the monsters .
i see a lot of hydraulic oil coming out .
all right .
i think we might have a sample there .
okay , mo@@ w
yeah , it just sp@@ ins me around .
surface , dee@@ p@@ sea challenger , preparing to ascen@@ d . over .
weights are coming off
weights are off . on as@@ cent . over .
exploration is never done .
you know , he 's driven us hard
who ?
the last time i shook my boo@@ ty

hol@@ la !
oh , no . how did you find me here ?
you know what 's not a secret ?
whole foods is where i come to get my groove on .
as much as i 'd love to see what else you 're gonna buy
it 's tuesday , and the d@@ j didn 't come .
no ! he didn 't show at all .
well , what did you expect ?
stop calling it a club !
what if i judged you for some of your jobs ?
what about when you worked at the gap ?
you , that time you were drunk , folding a sweater ,
maybe sebastian needs the money , too .
and if you ever tell anyone about the gap ,
still counts as a d@@ j sh@@ out-@@ out .
why don 't i take a break and we can go in the back .
busy !
hil@@ ary wal@@ dare works here , as a cashier !
oh please , this is real .
what , you couldn 't wait for me ?
the kelly with the cy@@ stic acne ,
i 'm glad you have no line ,
i 'm a cashier .
my husband left me for my dad .
well , i 'm sure you 'll pull yourself together like i did .
there 's only $ 14 here .
didn 't want the dinosaur k@@ ale .
oh , i don 't usually shop for myself .
caroline , do you not have enough money ?
i just don 't know why i have so many eggs .
you know , maybe before our meeting we should talk to a lawyer .
well , you must have someone in your family that 's a lawyer .
that 's amazing !
is that really what 's important right now ?
that 's super helpful , amy .
get out .
yeah , we actually dumped her re@@ tain@@ er in the toilet
but otherwise ,
oh , thanks . you know , i just wanted to get some work done
i 'm sorry .
you really think they 're gonna start treating you differently ?
i 've always been treated differently !
i mean , the first thought when you see me isn 't ,
i understand how you feel .
the business made us destroy it .
yeah . we found some in a truck
truck 's manifest led us here .
company sends us all kinds of material to sh@@ red .
hey , somebody has to lose the super bowl , right ?
maybe someone fell in .
not to mention o@@ sha .
you 're gonna have to shut it down right now , boss .
we want to talk to everybody who worked that night shift .
hey , got one right here .
except for the big stuff ,
that 's it ; that 's the whole grave@@ yard shift .
well , maybe they didn 't have to .
all this came from the one truck with the body parts ?
did you really sign up for this ?
still got wend@@ y on your mind , huh ?
believe me , i get it .
good night out on the town .
when ?
i got " y@@ uck . "
somebody 's in a good mood .
you have a ... certain glow .
detective var@@ tan@@ n 's a good man .
i , uh , sent representative samples to dna .
obviously , the body 's too man@@ g@@ led
i took a tissue sample .
i 'll give you a tour .
are you thinking entry wound ?
bullet fra@@ g .
greg found bullet fragments
you know this guy ?
haven 't you 've seen his online ads ?
i just signed up last month .
every aspect of our life has been reduced
my name is larry lam@@ ot@@ te , and i want to ask you a question .
you 're larry lam@@ ot@@ te ?
now , did i hear you gentlemen correctly ?
you look younger on tv .
marketing 101 .
and who is the man in front of the camera ?
yeah , he can 't string two sentences together ,
well , as i was , uh , telling mr. ka@@ plan ,
the credit cards were in your name .
hell , they even re@@ possessed my truck
six of ' em .
you running the credit card
on the computer in the bull@@ pen .
i 'm checking my purchases .
i can 't believe that i trusted those guys .
it 's like that friend that you meet in science camp ,
and then he starts showing you this sket@@ ch@@ book ,
it 's not the same .
right , but could still come from the same victim .
a previous incident .
over time , the body 's defense mechanism
maybe this sh@@ red of evidence will help .
cartridge case from the shooting .
no , the only good thing about a case going cold is
okay , so we 've got two shoo@@ tings , six years apart .
there 's got to be a connection somehow .
then someone kills julius ka@@ plan ,
could be .
sh@@ red@@ der guy had a credit card
right .
maybe he wanted larry lam@@ ot@@ te to know he was in town .
i mean , julius ka@@ plan said it himself .
well , he might be , if the thief is threatening
d@@ mv in florida
well , if he 's larry lam@@ ot@@ te ,
we pulled a six-@@ year-old print off it .
you have a very impressive cv .
goodbye , larry lam@@ ot@@ te .
ar@@ lo kar@@ den doesn 't have the same ring to it , i 'll give you that .
information is currency .
and you turned it into cold , hard cash .
knows every phone call ,
you knew about the blackmail .
you even knew
the thing about the " quo " is ,
and the " qu@@ id pro quo " started a long time ago .
" honey , can you grab me a cup of coffee " ?
" sweetheart ,
we spoke with lee dev@@ ries .
you used his identity to rent a ge@@ ta@@ way car
naturally , we 'd be looking for dev@@ ries and not for you .
1@@ ll 11@@ 11
she calls it " the bosom 's welcome mat . "
no . this is just to give you ideas .
i mean , do you want a train ?
not the kind of trains you like .
the kind on the back of a wedding dress ?
but while we 're on the subject of fashion ,
mm . well , i 've got a push@@ -up bra i can loan you
$ 500 million .
what do you need that kind of money for ?
i just need 2,@@ 148 high-@@ power lasers
shel@@ don , they 're not gonna give you half a billion dollars .
no . sh@@ h .
well , it 's too much money , you can 't ask for that all at once .
okay . what if you asked for $ 20 million ?
we have a deal ?
no . that 's only a two letter word .
well , i 'm sorry , shel@@ don , but this sort of thing happens .
50 years ?
you just have to wait for science to catch up
you know what they say :
oh , don 't be silly .
just be gentle .
you don 't seem like you really want to sell these .
these are all important to me ,
is it okay if i stand here and watch ?
if anyone asks , tell them i was brave .
i know , right ? that was crazy .
do you know how that makes me look ?
right ? !
and i even used the perfume he gave me in fifth grade ,
it 's the most beautiful gesture i have ever seen .
the horn doesn 't help , does it ?
but i can 't decide between mate or sati@@ n .
we decided against eg@@ g@@ shell .
why don 't we just paint the floor eg@@ g@@ shell
she brought that frog back to life !
t-@@ they 're suggesting that she skip fifth grade
we 're not charting out the next 20 years of her life .
if we don 't do this right ,
i 'm just saying
luke 's first hair@@ cut .
well , that 's it .
you remember when he hid that mouse trap under the pillow
yeah , so maybe spl@@ ash some cold water on your face
my name is luke dun@@ phy
that 's what he said when i was the tic@@ kle monster !
well , i guess you can 't have cake today .
claire , i guess i 'm picking up the cake myself ,
this is my new friend , charlie .
he smells so good !
what is going on ?
i know . it happens so fast .
today he gave us a roll@@ s-@@ roy@@ ce .
i thought i was gonna be able to meet mr. bur@@ t reyn@@ olds !
the one time that i thought
i 'm gonna kill him !
oh , yes . this is it . this is the one .
the lunch scene in a strip joint
maybe one where we just sat at a table .
unless you want to skip all that
i learned how to shoot a gun when i was eight .
l had night@@ ma@@ res about the basement .
i 've spent my entire life trying to get over the par@@ ano@@ ia
yeah , that quarter@@ back thing is all mess@@ ed up .
what is she gonna do with herself ?
she 'll be all right .
why do we have to come out again ?
what ? you don '@@ t. you don 't enjoy it ?
but hey .

l need to go do a number two almost immediately .
you deserve better .
all@@ y@@ son , you 're the cool@@ est , you 're the pre@@ t@@ ti@@ est ,
thank you .
let 's get out of here .
from a clinical perspective ,
they can grow accustomed to always being afraid ,
but there 's also the other side .
we do one more hit , we have the cash to get started .
jesus , let 's fucking go .
let 's just get it over with .
open the fucking safe !
this is agent martin@@ ez requesting immediate backup
but your kids ?
that 's the right move , you putting your kids first .
i didn 't put them first . i did this for me .
thanking you . thanking some man holding the door .
thanking jimmy .
and with all that , i never walked a day on the streets
it 'll be a cold day in hell before that
i was just about to make my decision
a closet doesn 't get installed in this town
it 's all about the songs .
whatever it is , it needs to be truth .
brother , i write love songs , to god .
sometimes to a girl .
so , yeah .
yeah
but to be honest with you ...
but i have to believe there 's a reason .
it will all be worth it .
you 're so good at it .
in one story . god grants healing
because each is a chapter in a bigger story .
each is the light of one star helping to form a galaxy .
i had my miracle .
it was enough
even when we can 't see .
all right , just this once you may close the door .
oh , damn it .
pri@@ ya , this is your brother .
would you be sleeping over again this evening ?
actually , he can .
if a woman 's father is not around ,
there it is , pri@@ ya . we 're indian .
my point is , you can 't go out with leonard .
my sister .
it 's very nice to meet you .
your former boyfriend has replaced you
oh . well , good for him .
so when you start crying ,
cool , huh ?

what 's the problem , danny ?

b@@ am , she sm@@ acked her head right on that thing , knocked herself out .

con@@ lon and the son were both seen pulling their weapons .
i 'm coming after your boy with everything i got .
you 've got no choice .
you and i are gonna meet back here at this restaurant
and i 'm gonna see how empty they are ..
you came home only when you needed a place to lay low .
and i 'd be scared to death that you 'd end up like cousin billy .
i got a job for you .
but it 's gotta be done by the morning
and what are their names ?
you 're fucking with me , right ?
this is for your own sake , right ?
that 's right .
so are you ?
i used to watch your fights .
i got fuc@@ ked by the judges . the judges didn 't fuck you .
you could 've made the rankings if you 'd used that jab more .
i know . otherwise i would 've put in for one a long time ago .
what 's her apartment number ?
two tactical units are heading inside now .
why do you think i saved you a front-@@ row seat ?
go out the nearest exit
e 's not in here .
you can 't ever pull that trigger . you understand me ?
we get everybody to go back to the edge of the perimeter ..
we 'll go to your uncle eddie 's house .
don 't wipe off the tat@@ too .
there you go .
we were jumped . over on bed@@ ford avenue .
where 's mom ? is she asleep ?
jesus christ .
it 's been all over tv . all night long . showing your picture .

it wasn 't enough that you ruined your own fucking life ?
i 'm not bringing michael into anything . i 'm trying to get him out .
sha@@ wn mag@@ u@@ ire .
get the fuck out of my house . get the fuck out of here !
he 's not trying to get you out of this , michael . he 's not .

where the hell would i go anyway ?
when the cops get here , i 'll tell them everything they wanna hear .
uncle mike ?
go home , l@@ j .
he won 't take this well .
he 's beginning to think anybody he attaches himself to is gonna end up in prison .
will you give us a minute ?
don 't you understand ?
she 's gonna lo@@ b it at you like a grenade .
i know .
we 've been over this .
you don 't have a violent bone in your body .
why won 't you let me help you ?
but you gotta let me deal with this . ok ?
however the fact that you discharged a deadly weapon during the commission of the crime
it says here that you 've requested to be incarcerated
the closest level one facility to ...
that 's maximum security . your honor .
we ain 't got all day to get this done .
move it . you got less than five minutes to take a shower .
let 's go . move , move .
never thought about it
man killed the vp 's brother .
which means no one up this river is more dangerous than him
oh , no the only time those boys get out is for chapel and p.@@ i .
may 11th . that 's the date , man .
i know .
the evidence says you did .
you got nothing i need .
my mistake .
wouldn 't think you 'd find the daughter of frontier justice frank working in a prison .
i believe in being part of the solution , not the problem@@ .@@ hm .
nothing . that was just my senior quote .
this whole time i was thinking it was gandhi .
sit tight .
so , how do we play this ?
nice try .
no . honey , no
i just can 't help thinking this is about ..
i love you .
" passion " ? what were you thinking ?
she probably thinks i went si@@ s@@ sy up in here .
one-@@ syl@@ lable su@@ cre .
" yes , " " no , " " love " " hate .. " " love . "
" yes , " " no . " " love , " " hate ... " " love . "
no one gets an audience with the pope .
top of your class at loy@@ ola .
i can 't help wondering what someone with your credentials
i gave him a shot when i got back from college . i did .
you ever think maybe he was hurt that you left in the first place ?
whatever it is you 're doing , don 't do it .
i told you to leave alone
you wanna do something ?
nobody 's trying to bury him .
the evidence was cooked .
take care of yourself .
something more is going on here .
gentlemen .
it 's our understanding that you have great influence with the governor .
we 're friends .
i 'm a man of god . how could i not ?
they won 't provide anywhere near the sheer strength
you want it by when , june ?
you gotta realise who 's getting punished
i did the same thing .
look where it got me .
i already scre@@ wed up that chance long ago
wouldn 't want to mess with the catholic roots , would we ?
you 've been checking up on me .
i went to north@@ wester@@ n.@@ graduated two years after you did .
i love you .
su@@ cre tells me you 're the local pharmacy .
fu@@ gn@@ ac .
standard over the counter vari@@ e@@ ty@@ .you can get it at any pharmacy .
i can 't get it at medical .
because they 're giving me insulin shots .
the company 's in trouble . i 'm losing my grip .
ii is difficult for a child to come to terms with it
i just can 't get through to him anymore .
the police have been involved . i 'm losing him .
i 'm here for ken , and i 'm here for you .
when the time is right , your son will return to you ...
you 've seriously gotta work on your english .
ry@@ u !
atta boy , r@@ yu@@ . don 't let him push you around .
after their uneasy beginnings ..
a special bond through years of training together .
i 'm going through with it . i 'm gonna tell him .
well
ken , we need to prepare ourselves .
if you don 't wanna go , it 's fine . i 'll just go on my own .
better come and make sure you don 't get into trouble .
what town ?
we have a mission to complete , remember ?
i 'm just trying to broaden your horizons .
by knowing where we have come from
master gou@@ il@@ k@@ x@@ en ?
tat@@ suma@@ ki sen@@ pu@@ -@@ ky@@ ak@@ u ...
and had@@ o@@ ken !
in the muscles of your legs .
whilst doing this , you must simultaneously concentrate .
as it reaches the moment of impact , the h@@ ado consolidated into your fist .
shor@@ yu@@ ken@@ . damn it .
how are you supposed to stay calm and without anger in the middle of a fight ?
good ry@@ u , you are close .
we just want to watch .
it 's not for the fain@@ t-@@ hearted
he 's big , but he lacks technique .
who you 're calling kid ? 10.@@ 000 says i 'll lay you out in the ring
but 15 grand says my boy here takes out your cham@@ p over there first .
it 's okay , ry@@ u , you got this guy .
just finish him quick before he kills you . no holding back .
e wants his son to come home
you can never just meet me halfway , can you ?
you 're here because of the company , aren 't you ?
what do you say ? come on . it 's time to come home .
he and the company can wait a bit longer .
i 'm proud of you , ken . you made a brave choice , the right one .
it helped him to get back on top of things .
what has go@@ ki done to you ?
how could things get to this point ?
it was not my fault .
t@@ n his own time . let him be .
no more lost than you are .
are you from the monastery ?
this little one i found wandering in the woods .
hello , my child . what is your name ?
if he has a voice , i couldn 't ind it .
it will still hurt
that would have been good to know last night .
actually , this lesson can wait
so you pop@@ ped your h@@ ado cherry . how do you feel ?
how 's your arm ?
they are not your concern .
now leave this place !
well , then i shall be waiting
that kan@@ ji ... master , who was that ?
" on the field of battle , there is no friend or fo@@ e , "
what do you know of war ?
you will never understand
it is the only way i can reach my full potential .
why ?
look at you .
yet you think you can master its greatest prize ?
the path of the shin oni drives me .
i know you don 't want to hear it .
i miss him too ,
just forget him ?
i still feel you should have done more .
he has chosen a path which no one can follow him on .
this stops now .
what do you mean ?
no , not yet .
i must become stronger .
for two years i have trained in nothing but sat@@ sui no h@@ ado ,
my training under him is coming to an end .
you 're leaving ?
when i return , i will be the master of this house .
what did my uncle say ?
i must have been dreaming ..
think i felt sat@@ sui no f@@ ado .
beyond the mountains , deep in the valley ,
he hasn 't been heard from for over two years .
you taught us that it was myth .
that one would become completely consumed by it .
it may well have been the death of go@@ ki .
something more dark@@ ly powerful than i have ever encountered .
i don 't know ,
one master must seek out another and destroy him ,
i 'd rather just stay and finish my painting
no good can come of remaining here .
i pray that you may one day forgive me .
this makes me proud .
there is little left i have to teach you ...
your remaining time will pass quicker than you think .
you old son of a bitch .
i 've finished your song . i play for you now .
shut up , woman . i didn 't ask you to sing over ry@@ u 's song .
it 's perfect .
thank you . i love it .
come on , boys . un@@ load the truck .
cool , it 's from my dad .
i said i 'll play with you , come over here .
help me , help me . when did i ask you to kill me ?
in time
be strong
sat@@ sui no f@@ ado .
this fight is not over .
i don 't know what 's got a hold of you , but if you can 't snap out of it .
ry@@ u .
calm yourself . it 's okay , ken . he 's awake .
it 's alright , man .
keep it . a me@@ mento of our battle .
at the end of the fight , there was an intense feeling of dark h@@ ado .
you promised me . i need to know .
look at your hand , ken .
i 've never taught you , never seen before .
ken , no excuses , no lies .
sen@@ sei , it wasn 't ken . i think it was me
you know , i was all ready to get out of here .
new people , new experiences , new challenges .
like sen@@ sei says , enlightenment through combat .
we 've come far together , ken .
thanks for everything , sen@@ sei . i 'm gonna miss you .
go and show the world what you 're made of . now get going
you guided me towards the buddhist path ..
when all i knew was turmoil and rage .
yes .
you have du@@ ti@@ fully served my master 's household ...
you are relieved of your services to me .
thank you .
no , i like hanging , out
yeah , i want to go .
hey , would you tell me the truth ?
that 's not funny .
might as well be a map to shang@@ ri@@ -@@ la .
i know what you 're thinking , major .
you mean , you couldn 't do it ?
there is no way out of the infection zone .
you might as well get used to it , major .
i won 't lose any more people .
really ?
well , if that 's the best you 've got , major ,
i 'm afraid i 'll have to love you and leave you .
you don '@@ t. you don 't even have to take me with you .
can you do it ?
you know , maybe there is ,
i believe in my mission .
look , you 're gonna have to go outside if you want to keep this up .
just not so soon . i mean , my career and
it 's real old . it 's been sinking in the mud forever .
betra@@ yal !
have you seen that girl ?
everything they say about communists is true . dirty and stupid .
come !
your majesty .
this is heaven street , your new home .
ru@@ dy .
stay outside , you fil@@ thy sau@@ ker@@ l .
do you like to run ?
go on . read one word . read something
i bet that wasn 't your first fight .
since he pe@@ ed in tommy mul@@ ler 's lun@@ ch@@ box .
j@@ t was a draw
oh , my god .
i have to get home .
i have to 20 inside .
what do you want ? my permission ?
where have you been ? you 're late .
ne@@ in , mama . rosa
and don 't forget to count the money .
are you sure ?
all here
if they could have shown me his body , i would have believed them .
a mother never gives up on her child .
do you think my mother really loved me ?
even hitler 's .
do you think she writes to him ?
he can 't just walk around .
because people will see in .
why ?
co@@ sa .
tried to make it as comfortable as i could .
if anyone saw , you know ?
make sure you knock first .
promise .
now you know what you 've been missing out on .

so i had better get started .
but i know this al started with a train
und on a place called heaven street ...
until the sun forgot what his face was .
for max , who gave me eyes .
i 've always quite liked the image of me with a sick@@ le and cape .
unfortunately , i 'm far more ordinary and commonplace .
it was a mis@@ read on a map .
it 's my mental health@@ .@@ my mental health !
could you let go@@ of my lap@@ el , please ?
they were growing increasingly concerned
great , she caught me staring .
i don 't trust friendly women .

jon@@ as .

gi@@ ver , wake up .
something can be done . something can be done .
all the memories back and back and back
we 're not permitted to see into the receiver 's residence .

leaving ? what do you mean ?
i want you to come with us .

he is .
i came to give you this .
the king 's je@@ wel .
how is this yours to give ?
why would you do this ?
i 'm not doing it for you .
let 's give these bast@@ ards a good ham@@ mering .
oh , come on .
upon us !
i 'm going over the wall , who 's coming with me ?
til@@ da !
si@@ grid ! get down !
you understand ? you must not come out for any reason .
show your father some respect .
you heard him , we make for great hall .
i have no right to ask this of any of you ,
to the king !
they 're r@@ all@@ ying to their king .
i say we stand with our men in life and in death .
you did what only a true friend would do
i am so sorry that i have led you into such peril .
each and every one of them .
farewell , master burgl@@ ar .
this isn 't what we wanted .
i know .
we are together .
i 'm not comfortable with it .
it 's chaos out there , rac@@ ha@@ el .
there 's nowhere to ..
there 's ...
this isn 't how it was supposed to be .
and yet here we are .
lawrence of hamburg , keith calls him .
he actually seems to like lu@@ bert .
is that wise ?
be careful , that 's all . they 're not like us .
it 's fine .
she should have asked permission .
don 't do this .
why ? what difference does it make ?
it 's been over for years , ever since michael died .
everything changed when he died .
you left me .
i 'm gonna ask you one more time :
you 're getting your teeth cleaned ?
i 'm moving in with sophie .
she makes you call her that .
and i 'm charging you with three counts of interrup@@ ting
you told me you had it .
it 's ole@@ g and han moving in .
han will see your feet under the door .
see you tonight at the be@@ ef-@@ a-@@ th@@ on .
i mean , you have all this stuff that you like ,
i 'll see you at 8 : 00 !
absolutely not
ole@@ g , will you excuse us a second ?
if we help ole@@ g out ,
but we just talked about it !
that baby fell fac@@ e-@@ down into m@@ ashed potatoes .
just because you rhy@@ me doesn 't make it okay .
there was so much awkward silence ,
oh , ole@@ g , dinner is ready .
no , i meant i would shower here .
in my bathroom ?
and the one before that .
president lincoln , sir ?
we saw you at , we .
i reckon it 's the speed that 's strange to me ,
i don 't want to be spared if you aren 't !
perhaps it 's ...
you dream about the ship before a battle , usually .
beyond description .
you don 't care about parties .
i know .
it 's not wil@@ ming@@ ton port , it 's not a military campaign !
why else would you force
don 't , don 't waste that power
i knew you 'd forget .
you need@@ n 't tell me i 'm right , i know i am .
she needs this for the grand reception .
good night .
me too , t@@ addi@@ e . but we can 't .
wil@@ lie 's gone . three years now . he 's gone .
that 's my speech .
from mississi@@ pp 's winding stream and from new england 's shore .
even if every republican in the house votes yes ,
only twenty ?
we can find twenty votes .
with the amendment ,
president lincoln says the war won 't stop unless
if they run out of bullets and men ,
jeff city ? that 's , congressman burton ?
republican .
perhaps you could call on him and inform him of your enthusiasm .
if the rebels surrender next week ,
and , why is that ?
spare me the indign@@ ity of actually speaking to democrats .
pardon me , that 's a distress signal
you had night@@ ma@@ res all night , mama 's right to ..
perhaps .
you know who you 've got to see .
ask pre@@ ston blair can i call on him around five o 'clock
oh . you don 't mind , boy , do you ?
they taught me a song !
soldiers know all manner of songs .
he 's at school now ,
good he 's not in the army !
leo , it 's a hundred miles to rich@@ mond .
yes ma 'am .
oh . thank you .
where 's my hat ?
all right ? go make peace .
we 'll commence our assault on wil@@ ming@@ ton from the sea .
was the boy playing with it ?
this is an official war department map !
now here 's where it gets truly slippery .
but the south ain 't a nation .
so if in fact the ne@@ gro@@ es are property according to law ,
we finish the deed now , we can 't wait !
on the 31st of this month . of this year .
wh@@ al@@ ers ?
the man 's never been near a whale ship in his life !
he@@ -@@ he ... he dra@@ gs his feet about everything ,
come december you 'll have the same in the house .
i imagine we 'd rejoice to see that .
if we pass it , which we won 't .
we all know what he 's doing , and we all know what he 'll do .
he 's said he 'd welcome the
you said
i 've never trusted the president . i never trust anyone .
no , mr. stevens , he hasn 't .
therefore nothing about you is surprising .
it 's late , i 'm old , i 'm going home .
leader of the god for@@ sa@@ ken republican party , our party .
retain , even in opposition ,
well , will he be unhappy if we lose ?
if that squir@@ rel@@ -@@ infe@@ sted
the house recognizes fernando wood ,
the new york delegation 's looking deci@@ dedly un@@ inspired .
his emancipation
who 's the swe@@ at@@ y man eating his thumb ?
perhaps he 'll jump .
jesus !
we are once again asked ...
which , if passed , shall set at immediate liberty
every member of this house ...
looks like he ate a bad oy@@ ster .
a point of order , mr. speaker , if you please ?
when will mr. wood
we shall oppose this amendment ,
slavery is the only insult to natural law ,
you un@@ natural noise .
you are out of order !
instruct the sergeant of arms to suppress this !
please don 't encourage this !
you 're back , you 're back , you 're back , you 're back !
here , help me get one of these to my room .
she 's asleep , probably .
no , sir , i don 't . no .
the good lord on high would despair of their souls .
we 've abandoned these 39 to the devil that possesses them .

and lastly ...
t-@@ tax collector for the western reserve , it ...
don 't just reach for the highest branches ,
uh , boats , the@@ y-@@ they make me sick .
let the assistant assistant port inspector 's stomach go weak .
he 's selling himself cheap , ain 't he ?
scatter ' em over several
might as well let ' em in .
my associates report that among the representatives ,
not without consulting me , you wouldn 't ..
january 11
we 'll hear ' em out .
and next the democrats
oh , the bl@@ airs promise , do they ?
what hope for any democratic votes , william ,
it 's either the amendment or this confederate peace ,
what do you think their families think about me ?
i can 't concentrate on british mer@@ can@@ tile law ,
it 's a stur@@ dy profession ,
i ain 't wearing them things , mr. sl@@ ade ,
you 're delaying , that 's your favorite tactic .
now we 're working together , and i 'm asking you ...
when the people disagree ,
long and hard for the good of the people
the people elected me ! to represent them !
i admire your zeal , mr. stevens ,
you claim you trust them .
you know that the inner compass
a compass , i learnt when i was surveying ,
what 's the use of knowing true north ?
make time to talk to rob@@ bie .
too young for the army .
don 't take rob@@ bie .
go away ! we 're occupied !
they cannot possibly maintain under this kind of an assault .
fort fisher is a mountain of a building , ed@@ win .
to bring this down ?
it 's gru@@ esome !
this fight is for the united states of america .
they 're not lazy . they 're busi@@ ly buying votes !
before this blood is dry , when stevens next takes the floor ,
george , please . stay on course .
i can ensure that every
although i 'm disgu@@ sted by slavery
we must consider what will become of colored folk
that 's what 'll become of them !
too publicly against us . he can 't change course now .
bless my eyes , if it isn 't the post master

my neighbors in n@@ ash@@ ville ,
you do right , clay haw@@ kins
wait ! ! you wanted , what was it , tax man for the western reserve ,
eleven votes ? !
there are defec@@ tions in the rich@@ mond
ask the horse what he thinks .
there 'd be no sixteen year old boys left .
just read me back the last sentence of that telegram , please .
" have captain sa@@ und@@ ers convey the gentlemen
say you believe
or you risk it all .
do you or do you not hold that the pre@@ cept that
to promote your ultimate and ar@@ dent dream to elevate ..
now you have always insisted , mr. stevens ,
i don 't hold with equality in all things ,
you believe that ne@@ gro@@ es are entirely equal to white men .
for shame ! for shame !
how can i hold that all men are created equal ,
how dare you !
and so again , sir , and again and again and again i say :
mr. president ..
what 's the matter , bob ?
and i will do it and i don 't need your permission to enlist .
" i don 't need your damn permission , you miserable old goat ,
or i will feel ashamed of myself for the rest of my life .
and not just to other people , but to myself .
but i don 't want to be nothing .

and if the slaughter of cold harbor is on your hands same as grant ,
just , just this once , mrs. lincoln ,
the child who was not only sick
oh but your grief , your grief , your ..
in@@ exhaus@@ tible grief ! how dare you throw that at me ? !
i ought to have done it ,
do it ! don 't you threaten me ,
i couldn 't tolerate you gri@@ eving so for wil@@ lie
and i still do .
don 't speak to me about grief .
and ... bear what we must , hold and carry what we must .
may ligh@@ ten this burden ,
and since you are sending my son into the war ,
no one has ever lived who knows better than you
because if you fail to acquire the necessary votes ,
i know you 're concerned .
god will see to it .
he may wish he 'd chosen an instrument for his purpose
are you afraid of what lies ahead for your people ?
white people don 't want us here .
i assume i 'll get used to you .
what my people are to be , i can 't say .
i never heard any ask what freedom will bring .
as for me .
wearing the union blue .
i 'm his mother .
what else must i be ?
why are you here ? no offense , but mr. se@@ ward 's
oh , you 've got no cause to be encouraged ,
" we have heard the chim@@ es of midnight , master shallow . "

y-@@ yes sir , we sit only three desks apart .
a republican , and you , cough@@ drop , are a democrat ?
um , that is to say , i ...
i can 't accomplish a god@@ dam@@ ned thing of any human meaning
we 're stepped out upon the world 's stage now , now !
blood 's been spil@@ t to afford us this moment !
yes . but how ?
i am the president of the united states of america ,
we welcome you , ladies and gentlemen ,
on the matter of the joint resolution before us ,
i 've just received
the conservative faction of border and western republicans
quick , man ! quick !
word for word , this is precisely the assurance
give this to mr. ashley .
could you please just step outside ? !
making false representation to congress is ...
we won 't know ourselves anymore .
we have no legal basis for that discussion .
if they escape , leave the country while my back 's turned ,
by outward appearance ,
i never seen the like of it before . what i seen today .
you always knew that ... what this was going to be .
you must 've needed to see it close
and we 've won the war .
you 've an it@@ ch to travel ?
to the west by rail .
of course , had he known what she was about to do to his life .
dh season 4 episode 1
or a recently diagnosed tumor .
regardless , it 's all they will think of .
carlos .
uh , she left a note which pretty much bl@@ ames me .
i can 't believe this is happening .
yes , but the good news is she 's gonna live .
oh , cra@@ p .
i just got married .
ga@@ by you just said you don 't feel like victor really loves you ,
edi@@ e tried to kill herself tonight .
i found her just in time , but obviously , i can 't come pick you up tonight .
in a few weeks ? what ?
victor 's in the bedroom right now waiting to consum@@ mate .
susan !
you haven 't changed a bit .
how 's your aunt ?
i feel so lucky to have you for a neighbor .
look at my view .
and that pine tree in the backyard .
oh , it absolutely kills me to have to ask you to cut it down .
the nice thing about this fake pregnancy is my feet don 't swell .
b@@ ree !
but i 'll be gentle .
perhaps i need to make my point a little more clearly .
is there a problem here ?
i 'm just saying hello to a very dear friend of mine .
i don 't know , but you 've got to stop rough@@ ing them up .
dr@@ .@@ go@@ ren@@ berg just had a patient go into labor .
sure .
doctor ?
i don 't need any test !
now i don 't know what kind of nonsense they taught you at .
oh , my god !
just give me the damn test .
if the sheriff comes , we will drive him away with our bows and arrows .
i 'm feeling a little .
i bes@@ e@@ ech thee !
i said i didn 't then you changed your mind .
that 's not gonna happen .
if you wanna have kids , you might wanna jump on it right now .
it 's okay .
surely not over food .
you know , and this whole thing has just brought us closer together .
hello . i don 't think we 've met .
ga@@ by , the woman tried to kill herself because i left her .
neither am i !
mommy has to conserve her energy for more important things .
how many more mis@@ haps are we gonna get away with :
pretty soon , this whole char@@ ade will completely unra@@ vel , and we will be humili@@ ated .
well , that 's not true .
you held something back because you knew what we were up to .
an audi@@ tion .
doesn 't matter . you failed .
but your deception was obvious .
he 's not gonna check every compartment .
listen . every man for himself .
hi , daddy . hi , dad .
good . okay , i guess .
yeah . when are you coming home , dad ?
why ?
grandma says you 're never coming back .
are you offering me a choice ?
then you do have a choice .
tell the crew where you want to go .
how would you like to go home ?
you can 't fix that . no one can .
building a dream from your memory ...
is that what happened to you ?
this has nothing to do with me , understand ?
hey , get off of her . back up . back up .
get off of her !
it 's versatile .
thank you very much .
now , before you bother telling me it 's impossible , let me
hmm . arthur . you still working with that stick in the mud ?
oh , he 's the best , but he has no imagination .
listen , if you 're gonna perform inception , you need imagination .
we tried it . uh , we got the idea in place , but it didn 't take .
no , it 's not just about depth .
co@@ bb , do the others know ?
you 've gotta warn them if this is getting worse .
i need to get home . that 's all i care about right now .
because they think i killed her .
" i will split up my father 's empire . "
the sub@@ conscious is motivated by emotion , right ? not reason .
how do you translate business strategy into emotion ?
robert 's relationship with his father ...
... so they 'd turn and smile and i could see ..
right now or never , co@@ bb .
i realize i 'm gonna regret this moment ..
if i get on this plane and you don 't honor our agreement ..
complete the job en route ..
.... you have no trouble getting through immigration .
oh , yeah , absolutely .
excuse me , i think this is yours ? you must have dropped it .
oh . water , please .
um ...
you know , i couldn 't help but notice .
all right , third and market . sn@@ app@@ y .
it 's not .
maybe not . can you pull over and get this ?
come on .
you might at least drop me at my stop .
down ! down now !
this wasn 't in the design .
get him !
yeah , i 'm okay . i 'm okay .
this was your job , god@@ damn it ! this was your responsibility !
we are not prepared for this type of ...
we 'll be more careful and we 're gonna be fine !
put him out his misery .
co@@ bb , hey , hey .
no . it won 't wake him up .
not from this .
right . so , what happens when we die ?
are you serious ?
i am sitting this one out on this level .
ten hours of flight time is a week at this level .
that i can guarantee you .
no , he never gave me any combination .
well , what , then ?
you feel that ? you 've actually been trained for this , mr. fis@@ cher .
none of this is real . you 're in a dream .
.. is to try and remember how you arrived at this hotel . can you do that ?
no , breathe , breathe . remember your training .
i was sent here to protect you in the event ..
and i believe that 's what 's going on right now , mr. fis@@ cher .
okay .
right away . follow me .
jesus christ ! what are you doing ?
if you want my help , you have to remain calm .
if this is a dream , i should just kill myself to wake up , right ?
i believe they have you se@@ dated , and if you pull that trigger ..
it had something to do with , um ...
god , why is it so hard to remember ?
listen , it takes years of practice .
what is it , mr. fis@@ cher ? think !
they 're trying to extract a number from your sub@@ conscious .
we should try hotel rooms . what was the number , mr. fis@@ cher ?
five .
well , how will you know ?
and then when the van hits the barrier of the bridge ,
if it 's too soon , we won 't get pulled out .
it wouldn 't be very strong if it did .
are those projections his sub@@ conscious ?
are you destroying parts of his mind ?
you keep telling yourself that , but you don 't believe it .
what if you 're wrong ?
you keep telling yourself what you know .
what do you feel ?
i feel guilt , mal .
.. no matter how confused , that guilt is always there ...
that the idea that caused you to question your reality came from me .
what is she talking about ?
well , you know , she 's sort of new to this kind of work .
yes , well , she clean like rich girl .
this whole building is models .
when i lived in manhattan ,
you 're right . life is funny .
10@@ j . here it is .
maybe he 's the aber@@ cro@@ m@@ bie model from the christmas ad
hi , i 'm big bill .
what are you talking about ? she loves you .
i think she has a blonde spot .. for me .
man , why do i never get invited to parties like this ?
yeah , this building has a real shirt shortage .
i doubt it 's the aber@@ cro@@ m@@ bie model 's apartment .
it 's addressed to " cleaning do@@ od , "
so , do you think he slee@@ ps in the nude ?
oh , oh , you 're the reason ?
you did . and who delivered the cup@@ cakes this morning
i floated over there and got paid for the job that i got us
oh , no ! i am going to wake him up .
oh , see ? i can 't get away , because you 're the rock
this is cleaning job ,
what is all this ?
i 'm going to go wake the hot model up .
as usual .
what kind of question is this ?
i don 't know these people or this place .
i 'm just saying , it 's the ap@@ pal@@ achi@@ ans .
especially my sister and danny .
gotta love therapy .
sally ?
.. i 'm pretty sure we can handle you , though .
this is huge !
they call this a spa ?
just let it roll off my back nowadays .
as i said , we weren 't expecting so many .
uh , no , no , it 's fine . really .
what is that ?
we 're really staying here ?
now you keep doing
fucking family .
like , you 're carrying them around everywhere .
just wh@@ atis a lovely coup e like you doing settling in hob@@ b springs ?
well , nice for him , huh ?
you take one of these up there , do me a favor , show it around .
danny . we 've been looking all over for you .
take a look at this picture and tell me if i should be .
how could i not know any of these people ?
maybe your side of the family moved .
i think we just met your cousins .
i don 't know how to break this to you , man ,
you heard him !
we 've had a sorts stay here , including three presidents :
jefferson davis ?
he was just m@@ essing around . weren 't you , vic ?
families really tam@@ ed this land , they made it into something
ever been bow hunting , danny ?
i would like to keep it that way .
d on ' .
i 'm getting used to it .
your girl , she really didn 't want you to come .
that guy with the fancy car and girl to match .
not my company .
i lost a lot of people 's money .
i guess that 's when you find out who your real friends are .
maybe they think you owe them .
it was all so embarrassing .
bait your area .
you don 't wanna go after your prey .
most of it 's not mine anyway . ah !
who ? are you tri@@ pping ?
you sit right there .
now to get you out of those bloody things .
now , don 't you be that way . i pat@@ ched up all my brothers
oi . fine
you just ..
t '@@ oni will be here any second , so .
you 're very important to us .
i had a bad feeling about this .
did you actually kill something ?
you actually ... yeah .
can i interest you in an herbal essence ?
you see one mountain monster man , and you go cold turkey .
nothing . give that to me .
oh , shoot !
sure , but .. see , br@@ y ?
the rest of it is just simple business sense
don 't you fre@@ t , lover .
fried outlets
this would go a hell of a lot faster if we knew what danny had in mind .
we need keys to some of these places .
that 's for the lady . that 's for you .
it 's the family vin@@ tage .
it 's a place for our folk to gather from far and wide .
like your friends came with you .
god created both the lamb and the tiger .
both parts are perfect and necessary .
.. and that is also the artist 's nature .
after all , the poor lamb didn 't ask to die
but still the same red van . now all bloody .
now , that 's exactly what i thought .
your nar@@ cis@@ si@@ sm knows no bounds .
for me though , what was really sens@@ ational about the work
the dark light .
the ones i deal with tend to rep@@ ent all over the place .
imagine a man walking down a street
we want to go up in the tower , mom .
ye@@ p , we are going up .
i 'll aim ..
excellent !
as you can see , this one was hit here
that 's why typically a good hunter would have
verge ?
i don 't feel so good , verge .
you want me to show you the way to the next whis@@ key bar ?
it appears at this depth .
and perhaps it 's more interesting to him .
but to be honest
no matter where you go
i actually net sad when i think about it .
women are always the victims , right ?
told you before , this is private property .
all the king 's horses and all the king 's men
who 's stupid ?
l 've also killed men .
well , the stories i 've told were selected at random , but .
it turns you on , doesn 't it , jack ?
not physically , they 're just easier to work with .
to kill , you mean .
mr. sophistication believes in that theory .
thereby , it 's neither particularly good nor evil
he argues quite well that the ultimate goal
verge , you 're a bitter old bast@@ ard .
may i illustrate now ?
i don 't have a handle on how many processes take part
the three most common forms of decomposition are
albert spe@@ er invented " the theory of ruin value "
hu@@ br@@ is is punished by n@@ eme@@ sis
this talk about the value of ruins
the scre@@ ech@@ ing sound .
poor design , please .
no one who heard it in action will ever forget that sound .
known as jericho 's trum@@ pet .
hey , yeah . we 're just talking about the trip .
you have a plan ?
he 's .. he 's just gonna collect tiny spo@@ ons
i 'm not collecting tiny spo@@ ons .
okay , well ..
by the way , travel tip :
will do .
the grandma thought that i was a ghost .
thank you all for coming out
thank you , miss parker , for having me .
and thank you , spid@@ er-@@ man .
thank you !
i was a little stiff . i felt like i wasn 't in the pocket .
yeah . i actually think you were a little stiff .
why don 't you want to talk to him ?
you sent nick fury to voic@@ email ?
you don 't send nick fury to voic@@ email .
you do not ghost nick fury .
after my trip .
no , no , he 's not gh@@ os@@ ting you .
are you the head aven@@ ger ?
uh , no , i 'm not .
does anyone have neighborhood questions ?
what 's it like to take over from tony stark ?
what ?
italians created it , and i discovered it .
that 's the thing . it can means a million things .
i don 't know and get out of my face .
oh , so you 've been drinking es@@ pres@@ so ?
a rose for you .
we 're talking about an eternal inflation system .
it 's insane .
don 't ever apologize for being the smar@@ test one in the room .
they were born in stable orbits within black holes .
the science division had a technical name .
like th@@ or .
these myths are threats .
we mobilized and fought them ,
all we did was delay the inevitable .
so thank mr. beck for destroying the other three .
the strongest of them all .
it 's the one that took my family .
and it will be in prague in approximately 48 hours .
and you 're coming with us .
i 'm sorry , man . i have to .
okay , put your one foot in front of the other ,
you missed them .
what ?
yeah , so why are we here ?
i 'm home .
the sque@@ ak@@ y wheel gets the upgrade grease .
no , i was sick . remember ?
you know , susan yang thinks you 're a male escort .
well , then you 're spid@@ er-@@ man .
look , i know you have a lot of questions ,
you took everything from me !
pause .
yeah , can you just fast-@@ forward to the end ?
all right , fly , fly , fly , z@@ ap , z@@ ap , z@@ ap .
kill image .
all right , weapons .
let 's save the world , people .
you 're an fos now . " friend of spid@@ er-@@ man . "
but it 's fake , so , there 's nothing to worry about .
great work , gu@@ ter@@ man .
i have a fake id ,
if it wasn 't for those stupid videos ,
i saved us , guys .
i faced a lot of deception .
so it 's time for the truth to be out there .
yes .
if carlos 's mother dies , there is no statute of limitations .
shut up !
how could it be murder ? it was an accident !
but we can 't sell it .
we 'll take the car to a bad p@@ ant of town ,
anyone could have hit mrs. sol@@ is .
b@@ ree , are you sure ?
i was up all night reading statistics on line .
i hope whoever hit ju@@ an@@ ita gets put away for life .
an innocent woman gets hit by a car and the driver just takes off ?
you should go home and get some rest , eat something .
carlos , i can stay here with your mother .
you can 't go on i@@ ke this .
what if she dies ?
why would i steal from you ?
i hear you bit@@ ching on the phone to your bank .
i can put up with your deb@@ au@@ ch@@ ery and your food theft , but i will not tolerate sp@@ ying .
you don 't mean that .
i 'm leaving tomorrow to visit my sister for a few days .
i 'll do you one better .
i hope this works .
i 'm up all night , and then do@@ zing off during the day .
i plan to stop , but right now , i need to sleep ,
i know you 're not .
hmm , sounds like a job .
um , yeah . uh ...
what time do you want me to be ready ?
well , what ? realistically , i 've known this guy a few weeks .
if you really think that , why are you going on a trip with him ?
so have the police come up with any leads ?
they 'll be able to determine the make and model of the car ,
no change .
we put her on our prayer list at church .

u@@ gh , u@@ gh !
which sounds great , but for me ,
to me , the perfect way to spend summer vacation
the real problem is , me and my dad have nothing in common .
i think i have a shot at a fun summer .
my dad has this crazy idea
my dad has his eye on me , so the key to a successful summer ...
i 'm sorry . did you say something ?
it 's the first day of vacation .
actually , that 's exactly what i thought .
back then , tin@@ gy was a flu@@ ffy blue blanket .
you don 't think he cares anymore ?
what ?
my dad and i don 't agree on anything , except for ...
we both hate it . but we can 't stop reading it !
it 's not even a joke !
this is important .
you need to get to greg 's level and really engage with him .
i have nine hundred and forty-@@ nine e-mails ?
i have to get out of here !
please check the number and dial again .
9@@ 11 . what is the nature of your emergency ?
hello ? are you hurt ?
i don 't think so .
yes , officers ?
what ?
you can never trust me again .
row@@ ley , i get it . you didn 't want to hurt my feelings .
that 's all right .
so what about the gi@@ g ?
don 't want to be late for work
but if my dad finds out i don 't really have
i 'm even considering telling him i got down@@ sized .
but i don 't think he 'll like it .
so many identities , i 'm having trouble keeping track of them .
i 'm sorry , mr. jefferson ,
that is not my son .
good morning , arthur !
row@@ ley ! my man ! what 's up ?
your boy should be expelled .
shut up , stan ! just shut up !
i know . it 's on my phone .
there can only be disappointment from here .
i know i am a very good " on paper " person .
but when it comes to being an " in person " person , i ...
i said i didn 't want to talk about sad stuff .
i 'm dr. banks .
officer . this guy 's on something .
you understand ? he came at me !
he 's fine .
he saw his dead father driving the taxi .
weird for me and you , but it 's perfectly normal for him .
m@@ va in bed eight , with minor head trauma , in need of a consult .
better living through chemistry .
yeah ? i 'm dr. banks .
uh , we have to wait for the ct scan results to know that .
oh , honey , i think she must have been putting on a brave face .
i want to start her on this . it 's called an s@@ sri .
what does that do exactly ?
in a few weeks , she should start to feel better .
it was soft . absolutely , it was soft in that first ..
how did that happen ?
and he would just order the most complicated drinks .
one night , he climbed over the bar
and you went .
and watched me while i made drinks .
then he stared at me like i was a painting .
ta@@ u@@ cht me how to ski .
proposed to me in ma@@ ui that winter and we were married by spring .
that was five ve@@ ars ago , so i was 23 .
did you see anyone about it last time ?
i had to stop seeing her when they took our house away
no , of course not .
she didn 't just have the rug pulled from under her ,
even her health insurance . she moved into the city to find work
why is that ?
she says you tried her on medication .
really struggled . m@@ mm .
j@@ h . well , maybe she 's a candidate for one of these newer me@@ ds .
i put her on abl@@ ix@@ a .
we 'll be starting the presentations soon ,
no ? no .
a week ago . oh !
i 'm sorry ! i can 't , i 'm sorry .
come here .
thank you .
what are they called again ?
is it bad that i 'm doing this ?
lawyers , musicians .
it doesn 't make you anything you 're not .
it 's between me and two other people .
but haz@@ lit@@ t says i have the inside track .
emily .
i 'm with my wife .
could we just go talk ?
no . i just , um ...
and i was like when i was in the car .
you 're going to go to work after ?
what did p@@ fi@@ zer have to pay to make their whole thing go away ?
lil@@ ly paid over a billion to settle the zy@@ pre@@ x@@ a thing .
a certain rep , who will remain nam@@ eless ,
if only i 'd known you liked baseball .
go to a few mee@@ ting@@ s. recruit some patients , track some data .
yes .
oh , i see .
yes , honey ! in here , swee@@ tie . just un@@ packing .
oh , love . oh !
back to bed , swee@@ tie .
yeah , i 'm pretty much sure we all do .
albert einstein , remember him ?
where is her lawyer ?
no sion of struggle on either one of them .
we had an appointment last night that she didn 't show up for .
any idea why the dinner table was set for three , dr. banks ?
no , she didn 't have children .
for depression , right ? i 've seen the ads .
i 'd like to speak to her , if that 's possible .
it 's possible , you see , that she was asleep .
she walks in her sleep .
she 's had other episodes .
stand up , please . and turn around .
and before you answer that
well , this goes one of two ways , doesn 't it ?
in which case , you 're the target of a bid civil suit .
this is different .
i never want to see another pill again .
another pill to help me sleep .
i don 't think so .
i killed the wrong person .
jon . you can 't follow them around
i think they 're going to charge her .
ou said she has no memory . no criminal intent .
a man in arizona .
woke up the next morning , no memory of it .
neighbors even saw him throw the body into the pool .
a woman bl@@ ud@@ ge@@ oned her husband while on vacation in san@@ i@@ bel island .
i assumed as much .
t know you are , but if she goes away ,
she ever talk about killing her husband ?
you spoke to any of the family ?
we need your help .
a patient of mine was arrested .
yeah . pretty bad .
no , not at the moment .
i have no comment . she 's my patient . that 's all i can say .
i saw some press people downstairs .
is that for you ?
my wife never liked me coming here .
it 's going to be a " thing . "
i 'd really like to focus more on what 's going on with you .
no . you 're taking something else .
as part of the office 's medical conduct review ,
and expressed a desire to get better .
in addition , she had no history of violent behavior .
i didn 't think she posed a risk to others .
dr. sie@@ bert . hmm .
you also do work at the hospital , a number of shifts .
and you said you 're doing pharmaceutical consulting .
my wife lost her job .
i bought a new place downtown , too .
they can 't come after you for any of this , right ?
they don 't blame me .
like i was on that case with the kid from uganda
what makes us human ?
an awareness of what we 're thinking and what we 're doing .
and so , i go to the fridge and i make myself a sandwich .
yes .
objection , your honor .
she 's known me for a lot longer , and she could testify .
and you weren 't in her care at the time of the murder .
what if i say no ?
but they have a body , they have your prints on the murder weapon ,
you walk out of here on your own .
well , what do you think ?
it 's become a part of the environment here .
we had the state board here . it 's on the nightly news .
she 's going to hospital for observation . it 's behind us .
and us , too , if we 're standing next to you .
rational people may look at it like that ,
we shouldn 't even have to ask . you should see what 's happening .
why are they writing this ?
it never happened . look .
f@@ ad her perform oral sex in your car ?
depression can take away your energy .
a number of years ago .
came in here every week like he was going to confession .
it was about six or seven months later
and he was lying to me .
at times , i blamed me .
from the tests . it 's in the blood .
or the past , or the sadness ?
we were consulting on a patient , not comparing re@@ sumes .
it wasn 't about me , it was about em@@ il@@ v .
yeah , and she was carrying the seat belt .
yeah , i saw it !
who wouldn 't be depressed ?
oh , god , it 's just so tragic .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
that 's not me . it 's william sty@@ ron . yes . william sty@@ ron .
there are times when i feel i could have written it , but
excuse me . are you julia ?
but united fell 40 % after the planes crashed
thinking something 's going to happen isn 't illegal
sure , you do , but , look . see !
down . way down .
she did it . she made it happen , do you see ?
hopefully with this and the consulting money we can finally get back ...
they fired me .
i don 't want to hear about emily or al@@ ison .
no , it 's not making sense !
the case is over .
i just want to know what happened .
that 's what happened .
how does it do that ?
but you killed him .
no . i never would have hurt him . i loved everything about him .
his hands . everything about him . i loved .
like he did ?
stop ! it 's too late ! millions of dollars were made !
the verdict 's in . it 's too fucking late for whatever that circus is
we have double jeopardy laws in this country .
and that you lied to a woman
you were never here .
she wasn 't depressed .
oh . i did .
i think she requires more observation .
this is dr. sie@@ bert on bridge street .
a different course of treatment to pursue
saved . end of new messages .
you could get national coverage on this .
nice try , jon . i 'm not buying it .
because they 're coming to take it back .
you could go and ask her .
she told me ever@@ v@@ thin@@ o .
none of the side effects you get with pills .
i also wanted to give you another test .
first saved voice message .
i 'm sure you 've received my latest notes
different course of treatment to pursue
wait . what is she saying ?
get off the phone . get off the phone !
get me dr. sie@@ bert ! this is bull@@ shit !
relax ! relax !
yes . dr. sie@@ bert ?
i 've been thinking about our last conversation .
an idea occurred to me .
hello there ! best we don 't talk inside , right ?
uh , she wants to go before the judge this week .
well , it depends .
we needed everyone to see how much i wanted it to work out with us .
and how terribly depressed i was .
it 's not a decision you make just once .
and it all leads back to him .
and you think to yourself ,
was it because of al@@ ison fin@@ n ?
a convenient distraction .
it could have been you or anyone else
i think it started there .
you know , i get scared that people will leave and then
uh , i 'm sorry , z@@ ach , this is an emergency .
how much did you have to pay him to get me out ?
you didn 't leave me much choice .
two accounts .
god .
yes , i 'm sure .
do i look sad now ?
yeah .
oh , yeah .
please ?
i do not like it , but i have a very full schedule today ,
you will run every test i ask for .
this woman has lost a husband and a son in this hospital .
o '@@ mal@@ ley ? george 's mother is our v.@@ i.@@ p. ?
as promised .
oh , you come over here and give me a hug .
i bet it never occurred to you
why ? do you need it today ?
uh , have you been experiencing any fe@@ vers at all , louise ?
yes , actually , i have .
i know . i 'm sorry .
you know how proud it makes me to have you as my doctor ?
go to seattle grace . they 'll take care of you . "
a doctor .
looks like columbia 's got a good match
my characters are my family ,
yes , i want to give my readers closure .
and i 'm the only one who can give it to ' em .
you want to help me ?
how fast can you type ?
i want to hear everything . how have you been ?
i-i got married .
ah , hunt . just in time .
can this just stay between you and me ?
now i 'm thinking . i must not be much of a teacher at all .
to prove to a judge that 's never met me that i 'm a good person ,
i 'm rac@@ king my brain for anything
but there 's a button missing , and it shows too much cle@@ av@@ age .
i 've got one shot at this .
and frustrated .
the lady of the lake appeared with a gil@@ ded scal@@ pel
i 'm actually being serious right now .
first of all , i was 19 .
why don 't you just eat it like usual ?
hm ? what 's that ?
something 's glowing in the spring !
did you see that , hawk ?
you 're much more gentle , though .
you came here to find a way to save your land , right ?
what you 've started is not meaningless .
i wanted to save the kingdom of li@@ ones too .
you , too ?
everyone , prepare to land .
this is
what is the meaning of this ?
was that supposed to happen ?
the demon clan !
there 's so many of them !
the resurrection day was supposed to be much later !
we have the great oo@@ ink with us !
the ceremony will have to wait .
for our most precious wish !
what is that ?
name yourself !
descendants of the goddess clan !
your dirty little souls will all be dev@@ oured by me ,
awa@@ ken , o great beast !
i 'll head to the top of cra@@ ggy peak .
oh , a flying captain lef@@ to@@ vers .
hot , hot !
we 're saved !
i will be your opponent now .
you 're going to play with me , right ?
that 's one down !
how can you still be alive with needles all though your body ?
you wanted a hug , right ?
the six knights of black .
yet , you 're so lawless , even the demon lord abandoned you .
you bast@@ ard !
my skills have surpassed that of the ten commandments !
are you finished ?
how dare you hurt our friends !
won 't move ..
you 're up to no good , aren 't you ?
how could the captain lose ?
he 'll be okay , right , mer@@ lin ?
but this sword appears to be quite dangerous .
this is due to the hidden power of the winged sword .
this sword can only be handled by the head warrior .
sol@@ ad ..
father !
you are all right ?
what about your injury ?
it 's said they even prey on the demon clan .
the time of ruin .
we 'd better revive the captain real quick and stop that monster .
you must not pull out that sword .
he is a demon ! a high-@@ ranked one at that !
a demon was pretending to be sol@@ a@@ ad ?
master z@@ oria ....
for 3,000 years , the winged sword has been passed down so that we can fight
countless lives have been lost in these battles .
do something , gran@@ ny !
master z@@ oria , the beast is headed this way !
i will follow suit !
the desire to protect people has nothing to do with laws .
it 's a bit late in the afternoon , but i still have plenty of power left .
i wanted to observe this exchange a bit longer , but
you can leave it to us !
you guys protect the women and children in the plaza !
you can die alongside the cel@@ esti@@ als !
no , the plaza !
we can 't let it get near the plaza !
new spirit spear ch@@ asti@@ e@@ fo@@ l . second form .
fil@@ let and roast !
you 're in the way !
master z@@ oria , the seven deadly sins are batt@@ ling the in@@ dur@@ a .
you too ...
i don 't deny that i was a co@@ ward .
i have paraly@@ zed his sight .
you 're different from what i 've heard .
thank you for protecting this village while i was away !
after we get rid of that beast .
mum ! it 's just my bow .
leave her be .
mum ? you 'll never guess what i did today .
fire falls ?
what did you do , dear ?
hungry , aren 't we ?
i don 't want my life to be over .
but are you willing to pay the price your freedom will cost ?
if you could just try to see what i do , i do out of love .
i 'm just not ready .
i think i could make you understand if you would just ...
i 'll make you a deal for this rare prize .
it was sweeping by itself . that 's ridiculous .
i should know . i 'm a . whit@@ t@@ ler .
how about this conversation starter ? it 's made of ye@@ w wood .
that 's stuffed .
i didn 't know what to think . look at your dress .
well , you 're home now , so that 's the end of it .
mum !
how do you feel about the marriage now ?
all right , that 's fine . that 's just fine .
it 's good enough .
what ?
we 've been waiting patiently .
he 's got big giant pa@@ ws !
it 's locked .
i pro@@ pped it open with a stick .
for goodness ' sa@@ kes , mau@@ die , would you get a grip ?
come on , mum . quick .
mum , we 've got to hurry .
go on and help yourself to anything you want , as a reward .
fate be changed ,
and thank you for shopping at the cra@@ fty car@@ ver .
welcome to the cra@@ fty car@@ ver ..
.. for all your ...
i 'm off to the wick@@ er@@ man festival in stor@@ no@@ way ...
we 'll sort it out tomorrow .
you 're the king .
none of your sons are fit to marry my daughter .
they 're gonna murder each other .
i know , i know !
shut it !
once there was an ancient kingdom .
that kingdom fell into war
aye , but it 's true .
it 's just a legend .
they ring with truths .
our stories are not yet legend .
our clans were once enemies .
you fought for each other .
my dad r@@ allied your forces
but i 've been selfish .
there 's no one to blame but me .
watch your blade ! you 're going to take somebody 's arm off !
give me a hand over here !
i 'm doing all the pulling here .
done !
are you out of your mind , l@@ ass ?
i 'm so glad to see
molly , are you sure it 's all right ?
thank you .
yeah , hi . i think i left my keys here .

we just can 't be seen by the dum@@ m@@ ies .
her cabinet is surrounded by a mo@@ at of exposed aisle .

such pretty hair .
you need to stick to the plan .
can we go to the carnival , too ?
come on . stay quiet .
my sheep !
bo , i 'm so sorry . really .

what about the others ?
it 's a commercial ! it 's not real !
it 's not fair !
okay , okay . calm down , duke .
right now , we need the only toy
you ever think about getting out there , seeing the world ?
no . you can 't teach this old toy new tricks .
so , how 'd you end up in this store in the first place ?
and i thought maybe you were inside
this is the only part of the store i ever liked .
for me ?
i am ?
i 'm gab@@ by gab@@ by , and i love you .
oh , what have you got there ?
you can take it home if you want .
what happened ? gab@@ by was supposed to be her toy .
mom , it 's over here .

like , you can 't you can 't tic@@ kle yourself ?
i 'm releasing all them hormones .

i think maybe you should go out into the woods
are you fucking with me ?
yeah .
get the fuck out of here .
i don 't know . i guess ...
wasting my fucking time .
the fuck you know about time ?
that was a good time to tell me she , uh , preferred women .
who was a mean@@ -@@ ass woman and an outrageous alcoholic .
just .. did not give a shit .
drama .
mother fell out of a window , landed on a free@@ way .

i want stories .
well , you get stories every week .
you make your own stories .
for me to have my son talk to me
what other kind could you have with him ?
i love st. patrick 's day .
just slip one of these babies into your pants
and possibly a very unpleasant paper cut .
put me down for five .
can 't you just go with de@@ ke ?
i know , but he 's snow@@ boarding somewhere called v@@ ail
this 'll hold us over till our 3 : 00 a.m. street meet ,
i miss my old st. patrick 's day tradition .
hell , no .
is this cab even moving ?
it 's the same one ,
if you touch my horn again , i cut your hand off !
do it . do it , if it 'll get us there faster .
and i 'm gonna need that for a junior king room
no , we won 't . we need that $ 356 .
it has to last till we 're 82 .
don 't worry , we 'll make more money .
damn it !
that means the parade 's over .
all right , i gotta move some t-@@ shirts .
" kiss me i 'm irish " cro@@ tch tees . $ 15 .
you nobody !
that 's illegal . you need a permit !
i can 't believe you call yourself russian .
oh , now you 're gonna cut out my tongue ?
look , oh , my god , it 's earl !
10 for a picture , 15 for a kiss , nothing below the waist .
will you take a 20 ?
just so you know , if you 're an orphan , i 'm interested .
we 're just taking advantage of drunk people .
well , then maybe you can get them to take advantage of me .
max , are you eating chicken ?
i think i came out ahead .
please . i 'm feeling sick .
is that one of those famous irish poems too ?
just let her cut . it 's st. patrick 's day .
not to bring up my st. patrick 's day tradition at the plaza ..
but it was so much better than this place .
max , this is boring . what happened ?
now i 'm thinking maybe this wasn 't
'@@ cause i feel like i got a text about it and ignored it .
well , that was quick . did you get properly fed ?
sure . we 'll see .
i just need my agent to call me back .
and we may disagree on what is considered fascinating .
why do you have mo@@ st@@ ly-@@ used toilet paper rolls in the cabinet in your bathroom ?
there on the end .
you 'll be a very rich man .
i want to talk about it now !
well , that 's not unusual , our grandmother and grandfather were first cousins .
here , jersey girl .
so , you still have a balance , miss israel .
but she 's really sick and she 's very old .
didn 't you people take a hippo@@ cratic oath ?
god . wow .
all right , i have $ 14 .
no , we need half the balance .
okay . just these .
i don 't want the others .
i just don 't want to carry them around anymore .
i told you i don 't want the others .
you know , you don 't have to be so dis@@ respectful .
just get it to me soon .
uh , hey , in the meantime ,
good afternoon , darling .
can i have a beer , pretty please ?
lee israel ?
last time i saw you ... thank you .
am i right ?
you 're friends with , um , julia some ..
yeah .
so , what do you think ?
i could give you $ 75 .
it 's a bit bl@@ and is all .
well , do you think you could pay in cash ?
i 'm glad to hear you 're writing another book .
did you hear tom cl@@ ancy is getting paid three million dollars
i mean , the p.@@ s. makes it pric@@ eless .
so , one of each , twice a day , in her food .
it 'll stabilize her .
oh , no , no , no .
yeah , it 's awful . i mean , there 's dead flies everywhere .
thanks .
i fear i must decline your invitation as this weekend
welcome .
i 'm aware that you sell memor@@ abil@@ ia and first editions .
yes , all of that .
wondering if these might be of interest to you ?
my cousin was a collector .
you clearly don 't know me very well .
come on ! spill the beans !
i have no one to tell . all my friends are dead .
i can 't fa@@ tho@@ m what criminal activity you could possibly involve in ,
libraries ?
how much are you getting for them ?
it 's a waste of a secret .
who else have you told about this ?
no . i remember you had someone .
why ?
unlike you , i prefer to put my money to good use .
i just thought we should do something .
" baby won 't you say you love me "
but if you are tempted , make sure you do your homework .
some care more than others about getting the real thing .
that one .
you run your mouth too much .
too much .
let 's go to your place . come on .
oh ! it smells horrible .
what 's going on in there ?
miss israel .
thank you for those cookies .
ms. israel .
so , what do you got ?
she had quite the mouth .
liked the ladies , too , i heard .
i assume so .
and people love this stuff .
that is fucking old . what 's that in cat years ?
ms. israel , i was wondering if you could come in tomorrow ?
please come in or call as soon as you can .
thank you . thank you for bringing it in .
what seems to be the problem ?
and he said that ..
it was illegal in those days , and ...
i 'm shocked .
you mean , your cousin ?
i 'm not gonna do that to you . i 'm a good guy .
i 'll lie .
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
that 's very generous of you .
you 're a clever woman .
oh , hello , welcome .
my grandmother just died , and .
and i discovered these when i was going through her closet and
oh , yes .
i guess i 'm not really up on all these things .
do you think it 's real ?
good .
you brought it back , right ?
you left it there ?
stop calling me an idiot .
i 'm just gonna kill myself first .
lee , come on . we can 't stop now .
maybe you could steal more real ones
fair enough .
i 'm a very private person .
yes , i understand that most of you could barely speak a word .
ar@@ ban@@ i@@ vic@@ z , i do admire your conviction ,

after six years of war in the streets , million gather to salute the allied forces .
representatives of millions who fought and work for their final victory .

yeah , how am i doing ?
so if you need me to make a call for you , i can .
there should be more than enough to salvage .
he 's a fourth year . he knows just enough to be annoying .
but look at him . he 's a cham@@ p .
now use two fingers , light pressure . go .
as well as live readings from local authors .
she loves mysteries , don 't you , honey ?
i 'm telling you , you really should look into it .
rose ridge doesn 't have anything that i can 't give her .
she burned your hand .
i know . i have been through this .
the least i could do is honor her in sickness
did you have any pets growing up ?
i 'm just trying to get to know you better . that 's it .
what were your dogs ' names ?
pick@@ les .
all right . okay .
i 've got it .
you 're an attractive woman .
you and a@@ very spend a lot of time together , don 't you ?
uh , but we 're just study bud@@ dies .
he 's an attractive guy , nice bone structure ,
have you noticed how up@@ tight he 's been lately ?
study bud@@ dies should help each other out ,
you 're not in love with penny .
the god kam@@ ade@@ va has shot us with his flow@@ ery arrows of love .
he 's the hindu version of cup@@ id ,
i 'm sorry . what ? !
" oh , bern@@ ade@@ tte , please play my clar@@ inet . "

okay , sure , i can meet with you on thursday .
yeah , and may i ask what this is about ?
that 's what he said to me .
thank you .
oh , i 'm sorry .
well , what color trash do you think they 'll believe ?
a man named jesus
well , nothing happened , right ?
well , you know , actually that 's not the case .
and he 's never been to texas .
what ? in the chat@@ ta@@ hoo@@ che@@ e national forest in georgia ?
no , no , nothing to be sorry about .
what ? but he 's a medi@@ oc@@ re academic .
he 's basically leonard with a bigger prostate .
this is ridiculous . i-i 'm going across the hall .
fine , then you go !
so , what do you do for a living ?
um , ran@@ d@@ all 's in between jobs .
it 's nice to meet the woman
prepare to be disappointed .
well , i could use another beer .
he 's done .
not at all !
i 'm , uh , leonard 's friend , stuart .
thank you for marrying me .
penny ...
but i don 't think i 'll ever understand
have you told them about the w@@ ab@@ ac ?
when i adopted sher@@ man , i vowed to be the best father i could be .
and so , sher@@ man inspired the greatest invention of my life ...
get that dog !
it 's simple , sher@@ man .
let that little kee@@ p@@ sake be a reminder to you ...
that no matter what challenges you face ono matter how far away i-@@ might seem .
that no matter what challenges you face , no matter how far away i might seem .
and when president wash@@ im@@ o@@ ton was a little boy ..
what kind of tree did he cut down ?
penny ?
fe@@ l in .
it 's really great meeting you guys .
i could bring my new model . it 's a hydrogen atom .
guess we 'll have to split it .
check it , guys .
i 'm sure he must have had a reason .
quiet , pur@@ dy !
it 's not normal for them to bite .
in my opinion , a dog can never be a suitable parent to a little boy .
and the court can take it away from you .
and rather un@@ characteristic , given how you feel about mr. gandhi
well , all right then .
try and get some sleep .
i have a deep regard for you as well , sher@@ man .
an advisor to heads of state .
when i found sher@@ man , it reminded me of how i started out in life .
a home
with all due respect , how hard could it be ?
if a boy can adopt a dog ..
da-@@ dal ! ho sher@@ man , not " da-@@ da . "
" ' imf . pe@@ a-@@ ba ba ,
" it s@@ not my birthday . no , it isn 't .
it 's not father 's day . is it ?
aren 't we , sher@@ man ?
say hello to penny , sher@@ man .
fel@@ lo , sher@@ man .
i am so glad you accepted my invitation .
you 're bar@@ king up the wrong tree , mister . in fact ... .
and i have to tell you , pe@@ abo@@ dy ...
hello . sure , i 'll take a survey .
because i could take it home , pretend to be sick .
mr. pe@@ abo@@ dy says you should never use the w@@ ab@@ ac .
how come ? there would be two of you .
i guess the world 's not ready for that .
um , well , now that we 've seen it , maybe we should go back .
ancient egypt . land of the phara@@ oh@@ s .
but a cruel and barbar@@ ous civilization just the same .
are these barb@@ arians bo@@ thering you ?
bows barb@@ arians .
and laid in a pit of fire ants ?
anything , my desert flower . consider it a wedding gift .
an@@ u@@ bis has spoken !
an@@ u@@ bis , you sound un@@ well .
but i 'm feeling much better now .
home .
before penny 's parents realize she 's missing .
certainly not .
or , perhaps , i 'm just some old " gi@@ za . "
uh , what 's the matter . , mr. pe@@ abo@@ dy ?
we 're going to have to make an un@@ scheduled stop .
we have just enough power to make it to the renaissance .
how many times i got to tell you , mona lisa ?
i can 't paint the picture ..
leonardo , tell me one thing i have to smile about .
all the things that make italy such a popular tourist destination !
translated into perfect engineering .
because children are not machines , pe@@ abo@@ dy .
oh ! it was cre@@ ep@@ y .
but i don 't want to fly !
no , seriously , penny , i don 't want to !
don 't let go !
i 've spent the last seven years teaching sher@@ man good judgment .
is that true ?
no , sher@@ man , i 'll never let that happen .
oh , dear , a black hole !
if i can 't pull us out of here .
thank you .
well , after a few failed experiments ... .
and constructed a rudi@@ mentary w@@ aba c
i just need to find a wor@@ m@@ hole .
hey , i 'm walking , here !
there they go . don 't lose them .
but they all lead back to the present !
there he is . after them !
mr. pe@@ abo@@ dy , you 're under arrest
you don 't understand
to@@ t usually .
if we set the w@@ ab@@ ac for the future , and go very , very fast ..
oh , my ..
i 'd prefer if you didn 't smoke .
he hasn 't ste@@ ered me wrong yet .
he can 't do it himself .
ex-@@ mi@@ 6 , but he 's still an insider .
is that right ?
you should have left me alone .
they changed their plans so i could join them .
not because i couldn 't . because i ...
so they flew without me .
re@@ za is an err@@ and boy .
you get those sorted and you 're sorted .
your breathing as the bass .
good .
the heart blows out .
what ?
are you out of your mind ?
think of your heart as the drums .
massive blood loss ... clean through the body ...
oh , i heard you found a donor
shepherd on the front page of a national journal ,
you think they air@@ br@@ ushed his picture ?
could you focus ? i need you right now
congratulations .
it was not good at all
i-i tried , but it just felt so weird
what i@@ f. what if me and er@@ ica are
two girls getting nasty and loving it ? that 's hot .
is everybody clear on that ?
i don 't know .
okay@@ . you 're busy i 'll be brief .
tonight ? you want to get together again tonight ?
fun .
your ank@@ les are looking a little thick
sounds just like a real doctor
oh the chief has got me doing press all day with journalists .
u@@ h-@@ huh i already pushed that .
paying money for a kidney
would drop out .
that 's what would happen
you 're in the hospital giving a kidney to a stranger .
your kidney may not be going directly to my husband ,
all eyes are on seattle grace .
yes , sir .
we got to spend time with each other
so , yeah , nothing
if you coul@@ d. just be patient a little bit longer
it wasn 't good for you .
something else will come up
we hadn 't spoken in over a year .
this was my chance to get him back .
i know p j. can be selfish
i worked late most nights .
you can 't blame yourself .
i guess you just try not to care too much .
these are , uh , your discharge papers .
it 's okay .
which makes me nothing years old .
caroline , are we still on for two boots pizza tonight ?
and just not because the city has demanded to
you can have one slice with two top@@ p@@ ings
okay , everybody .
first , the guy who found the be@@ ak in his sandwich
what do you think ?
oh , really ?
it was my grandma 's from russia .
she passed customs , then she passed this .
well , it takes four years for these cars to be custom@@ -@@ made .
that 's right , my father ordered this for me
all my father ever gave me was that one i@@ ffy chromosome .
it 's all yours .
it 's all about healthy choices .
damn , someone painted the bat@@ mobile white .
that 's a $ 4@@ 50,000 sports car .
and speaking of seconds ,
this is our ge@@ ta@@ way car .
is p. did@@ dy here ?
no one cool owns it .
now , this is the kind of car
i just got off the phone with my dad .
turns out they won 't let me keep my present .
they bought you a boy ?
hmm .
all right .
law enforcement officials are following several leads in what authorities are calling
i@@ ke foster and john tru@@ by died at the scene .
at the press conference earlier today ,
715 : 01 released updated information regarding the alleged suspects .
you still think i 'm crazy ?
come on , let 's get you inside .
you think it was real , or do you think he was fa@@ king it ?
his brain imaging says it was real .
detective , this was the worst case i 've seen .
it took everything i had to hold him down .
i know this place .
that 's why we brought you here .
why don 't you get the equipment ?
all right , mac , let 's get you out of here .
one of the men who died in the shoo@@ t-@@ out used to work here .
you brought us here .
why are we wasting our time with this bull@@ shit ?
he 's rebuilding the story of his past .
i don 't trust him either .
is it somebody you worked with ?
my eyes .
not without negative side effects .
a river .
cement towers .
i got it .
i got him .
come on , come on .
no , there 's someone from law enforcement .
dre@@ y@@ f@@ us .
they treat him like that because he 's jewish ?
a catholic officer would have had a fair trial .
he was denied due process on matters of national security
that could not be disclosed , but the evidence against him was not lacking .
with philippe i discovered an al@@ sac@@ ian restaurant in rue mar@@ be@@ u@@ f .
all right , carry on .
no secretaries , the colonel didn 't trust them .
a note on the hydraulic brake of the 120 and its functioning .
one on the changes to artillery units .
we recovered this one week ago at the german embassy .
probably in berlin .
what does the note say ?
he served in all four departments of the joint chiefs .
the guards are forbidden to speak to me .
the isolation is such that it feels like i am buried alive .
but it 's not just about my life , but my honor ,
it 's not a precautionary measure .
it 's a kind of torture . "
how long have you been there ?
are those letters ? love letters ?
it 's nothing , i assure you .
that 's an ab@@ omin@@ able suggestion .
of course !
i have nothing more to add on the matter .
enter .
good night .
leave the keys , i 'll do it .
" the germans have an officer informing them .
i parap@@ hr@@ ased .
no , he 'd lie like everybody else .
have you told general gon@@ se about this ?
it 's a small , very quiet section .
in the safe .
thank you . from now on if you don 't have any objections , i 'll take care of it .
this doesn 't stop here .
it warns us that e@@ ster@@ haz@@ y will be reported to the chamber of deputies
pic@@ qu@@ art !
this is an intolerable accusation !
nothing will stop you . i should arrest you for gross negligence !
i haven 't told anyone about the investigation and i 'm not obsessed .
what would you do if you had proof that dre@@ y@@ f@@ us was a spy ?
how do you know that ?
the generals understood that i wouldn 't keep quiet .
later in marse@@ ille , algiers and tunisia .
i ended up in an african regiment .
they intercept my correspondence and i 'm being followed .
my god !
can you prove any of this ?
you have to make it public .
since i was 18 , the army is my life .
did you inform your superiors of this news ?
what did they say ?
major lau@@ th , can you come closer ?
.. but you 're not a robot .
n@@ ope . definitely not to plan .
victory is ours . we won . we won .
not that again . you really still think it 's out there , don 't you ?
every thing here just seems so poin@@ tless .
who won
i know
you do like to clear your debts .
all i want is a recharge .
were you ?
now , let me see that .
the power for my cell is low again .
i 'd like to re@@ boot your power-@@ generator outs .
you know , you must 've been really something to see
everything changes . everything
i swear that 's your favorite part .
hey , whatever happened with that ?
i got the mechanical parts down , but the electronics are baff@@ ling
if you don 't realize it 's every man for himself .
done .
it looks okay .
not all of us would die for him . i wouldn 't
you should be okay now .
it 's matthe@@ ws .
thanks .
i 'd tell you , but i wouldn 't wanna ge@@ ek out on you .
i heard the drones lost the ability to identify friend@@ lies .
didn 't stop you from taking out those drones , though .
that 's great .
et 's 20 search those drones for am@@ mo .
how 's she look ?
she seems pretty tough to me .
she 's just trying to stay tough for their mission .
yes , they do .
it 's just that we 've been on the road for a while
you know , you 're aw@@ fully young to be mixed up in trouble like this .
fine , i get it . i get it .
and ol@@ son fixed your friend . so the way i see it , we 're even .
probably deserted since the war .
i 'm not sure if i should tell you .
is that why he 's helping us ?
are you a good cause ?
i hope so .
but he did and i wanna know .
oh , my god . i can 't believe it .
you 've been there . do you believe it 's what they say it is ?
without something like olym@@ pus , mankind will fall .
do you think they 'll be okay ?
you 're making me waste my am@@ mo , you hun@@ k of junk .
i 'm sick of his cat and mouse game .
stay here .
they 'll help you , i know it .
but you 're gonna survive this .
come on .
iris .
you 're not as innocent as you look .
all right . let 's get you out of this mess .
where 's ol@@ son ?
we make a good team .
we need to get out of here . let 's move .
walt . you have what you want . please , don 't kill him .
you 'll find that out soon enough .
we need to make sure he never actually finds it .
how many are we looking at ?
it looks , incomplete .
will it work ?
how did you know about it ?
the information about this weapon
he and i were sent from olym@@ pus to do post@@ war clean@@ up .
so futile and what a terribly misguided notion .
do you think he is still ali@@ ve@@ '
i thought you were dead .
and dr@@ la@@ re@@ os ?
oh , come on . what do you think ?
iris , open the door .
what 's going on ? open it , now .
no , get out .
br@@ i needs a clear shot . i can give it to him .
i really don 't know how much
coming through , on you right . hey here we go .
o@@ ops , excuse me . hey tr@@ is , i really like your hair by the way .
hey peter , why don 't you take your food and sit down huh ?
besides i think we all should
we need to find out where the
i will not be a part of your violence . no one is asking you to .
one .
one more chance .
you 're hurting tr@@ is .
but killing je@@ an@@ ine will not gonna bring your mother back .
what is it ?
gentlemen , am@@ ity welcomes you .
you 're exceeding your jurisdiction .
what happened to that am@@ ity polit@@ eness .
alright , but under protest .
all am@@ ity report to the dome
you seem aw@@ fully stuck in that doorway .
what 's up there ?
my people are ready for war if that 's what it takes .
we de@@ pose those in power .
once you killed je@@ an@@ ine , who 's in power then ?
don 't tell me this isn 't about you , this is only about you .
what ?
what are you talking about ?
the answer is yes .
so are you asking me to petition to council
correct ?
it 's a pretty ev@@ asive answer . evasion is not dishonest .
where 's your scary boyfriend ?
i love heights .
i know it sounds crazy , but .
i know they say its all just wa@@ st@@ eland out there but .
i need your help .
look who decided to show up .
alright folks , nothing to be nervous about .
hello .
why ? what she want with her ? tell me !
is that supposed to scare me ?
you know the punishment for that .
but can you ?
all i know , is that they put me in a sleeping si
you all know what this means
i wish i could do more .
it 's time we fight back .
and provided the instructions that
what : when
you can 't just abandon them
i have to admit that i 'm impressed
and turn yourself in .
i need you to open that box tr@@ is .
but the only people who have tried to it so far have died .
well
the chances of it being you of all people .
what 's remarkable is the amount of people you managed to murder .
but i 'm serving the greater good .
ma@@ m ?
are parents brought that on themselves .
the box , it was in their house .
all those lives could have been spared .
alright family reunion is over , it 's time to go .

that t@@ rel@@ lis lady had no idea who i was .

i didn 't want to wake derek .
i thought we hated your mother .

what are you all doing here ?
and she 's sharing him with me .
good morning dr . bail@@ ey . you look nice today .
dr. bail@@ ey i 'm gonna need one of your residents .
it 's yours .

kare@@ v you never know
if there 's a patient in pain i 'm there .

hey how 's mr . sol@@ tan@@ off ?
it 's gotta be scary going to bed at night
it 's your fault you know .
now i can 't help it.@@ you planted a seed .
no poo . no poo for you .
she 's telling you what 's real for her .
i still think this could be stomach cancer .
and i lay awake and feel lum@@ ps in my breasts
we live toge@@ ther@@ .you should 've come to me .
no but maybe i could ve stopped you .
george this is the one thing that i have done
this was all me .
she 's like in love with you .
okay you know what ? sa@@ die did that to herself .
let 's not pretend that you care about her .
he 's , you know ... he 's a little to the left , you know ,
cla@@ rence made some great choices musi@@ cally .
i wasn 't some kid .
but tonight , it 's only what could have been .
when big@@ gie died ,
after big@@ gie 's taken to ce@@ dar@@ s-@@ sinai hospital .
and particularly , mr. sean comb@@ s .
usually , cla@@ rence gets the call
because they worried about people at airports looking for him ,
so again , this was sort of master@@ minded
you know , i 'm sitting here because
i 'm cured . everything 's good , you know .
everything is good ,
so one action that i create could
considered a gang@@ ster , or a thu@@ g , or whatever you wanna call it ,
cla@@ rence is the type of person that wants everyone to do better
and he will argue it all day long , but i disagree completely .
thank you for doing what you do .
if he felt like you were going out there and doing for others
but if he feels like he did all this ,
of my time and my love .
in the end ,
let 's get that family together .
hey , man , i had a good life thus far .
you know , whenever i see cla@@ rence , he always gives me a hug ,
it just seemed funny at first
that 's not much of an apology .
and now i regret it . good-@@ bye .
yeah , i just wanted to stop in and see my office
yeah .
oh , sorry . where were we ?
right , right .
i wouldn 't mind a coo@@ kie .
i really passed out hard .
the kids could 've scre@@ amed bloody murder
i 'm sorry .
yes .
is he an un@@ speak@@ able ab@@ om@@ ination ?
well , he laughs at his own jokes ,
i 'm trying to invite my stupid brother to my wedding
hey , you 've reached george cooper .
see ?
shel@@ don , you tried .
hey , why didn 't you invite him in the first place ?
i get it ; i grew up with lots of brothers .
i can recognize sar@@ cas@@ m .
i '@@ m-@@ i '@@ m-@@ i 'm sorry .
your wish is my command .
oh , my god .
wow . you really can 't keep your hands off howard , can you ?
i just wanted to make sure you and amy didn 't get it .
you infected me a week before my wedding .
wear a veil ?
look at what you 've done to me !
there aren 't gonna be any wedding photos .
but if he says , " ner@@ d says what , "
so , how was your date ?
we 're so sorry we ruined your date .
his date got ruined .
it looks like it 's getting better .
i 'm sorry ?
i have nothing to apologize for .
sometimes you can 't patch a tire .
actually , that 's always the case .
while i appreciate your folk@@ sy tire wisdom ,
hey . shel@@ don , are you and leonard putting up a christmas tree ?
satur@@ n@@ alia ?
in the pre-@@ christian era ,
and that , charlie brown , is what bore@@ dom is all about .
you haven 't given me a gift .
don 't feel bad , penny , it 's a classic roo@@ kie mistake .
now , hey , it 's okay@@ .you don 't have to get me anything in return .
it 's no wonder suicide rates sky@@ rocket this time of year .
i 'm not giving you a present .
r@@ li@@ k ll@@ 5@@ u@@ o@@ 2@@ x-@@ j . 19
no . no , i brought this on myself
it 's happening to us .
yeah , i guess .
thanks for letting me try out your motorcycle .
i had no idea it was so heavy .
yeah . lucky for you it wasn 't moving .
my god , how fast were you going ?
good one . he couldn 't even get it started .
penny . so it 's your motorcycle ?
it 's fine .
you mind giving me a hand with speed rac@@ er here ?
so , um , dave , how do you know leonard ?
no , you 're not .
uh , well , it 's just that the physicists i know
um .. yeah . yeah , that sounds great .
boy , she 'll do , huh ?
so , you and her ... ?
really .
you see , the danger was that i might under or over-@@ reciproc@@ ate ,
then i 'll look up the price of her gift online ,
it is , isn 't it ?
so my offer is come with me now
hanging from a pipe , having your to@@ en@@ ails removed .
do you mind terribly if i borrow your car ?
are they still following us ?
somehow it just doesn 't seem like the right thing to do .
this road isn 't going anywhere . it 's taking us where we want to go .
good plan .
take another left through the window .
is the primary cause of world tension today .
you were right . the uncle , rudol@@ ph von tr@@ ul@@ sch , is the best shot .
he lives in italy . rome . works for a shipping company called vin@@ ci@@ gu@@ erra
your job here is done when i tell you it 's done .
it should have been . i didn 't ask you to light up half of east berlin .
what was waiting for me was barely human . you should 've seen it run .
how so ?
rather a sad story , what with your dad being a big pal of stalin 's
ten ? eleven years old ?
you did , however , rise above it . special forces . k gb .
i do wonder if it was your father 's shame that gave you such drive , though . or ..
i understand that she was@@ . extremely popular amongst your father 's friends
is this a joke ?
i 'm not going back behind that wall .
you don 't have to go anywhere that you don 't want to go .
what 's he doing here ?
wait .
of the soviet union by the black sea .
that man stole my father 's watch .
da , but a russian architect would fight .
so it 's no trouble unless you continue to question my actions .
would you like to finish what we started ?
you two are supposed to be looking after me .
either you start to look like you know what you 're doing .
good evening , mr. de@@ ven@@ y .
i apologize it wasn 't brought up earlier .
is there anything else i can do for you ?
i 'm still on duty , mr. de@@ ven@@ y .
but my shift ends in five minutes .
uncle ru@@ di has invited us
would you like bigger glass ?
i wonder , did i leave it in the ja@@ g ?
why on earth would you do that ? he doesn 't have an invitation .
thank you . thank you .
i 'm victoria vin@@ ci@@ gu@@ erra . i do believe an apology is in order .
if you don 't , there could be trouble .
are we in a rush ?
now , tell me , when did this happy accident occur ?
two years ago ? yes .
wanted to make sure it was serious .
why would she be ashamed ?
ru@@ di . ah , wa@@ ver@@ ly .
wa@@ ver@@ ly runs the shipping department at british oil .
i stup@@ idly seem to have lost my invitation .
yes . yes , i think we bum@@ ped into each other outside .
i do apologize . no , not at all .
what 's he done ?
they had it coming
how did you find alexander vin@@ ci@@ gu@@ erra ?
the answer 's yes . that 's not happening
so , like i said , it 's not happening
try not to get lost .
why ?
and , uh , what exactly did you do to him ?
although he 's standing upright , he 's completely unconscious .
i 'm afraid that isn 't going to stop you getting hurt .
only my mother calls me napoleon .
you may have heard of the dark angel of ra@@ ven@@ sberg .
and today , you have the privilege .... of experiencing his work fir@@ sth@@ and .
my apologies .
you wouldn 't describe him .
he was neither tall nor handsome , char@@ is@@ matic or am@@ using
he was bul@@ lied mer@@ cil@@ essly ...
year merged with miserable year .
but what the other boys didn 't understand about their victim was .
he saw them as instruments of learning .
you doing okay , cowboy ?
you did . just not the ones in your shoes .
you everything i know . you won 't be able to stop me .
don 't kick yourself .
that got their attention . they 'll have chop@@ per waiting for us at airport .
mr. solo . we meet again .
follow me
then we must give them an appropriate welcome .
naval intelligence for the remainder of the mission .
they are the key to the u.s. of a. winning the arms race .
gentlemen , can you hear me ?
well done , solo , ye@@ p , yeah . you got there in the end .
a daughter 's touch .
you 're wrong .
we assumed his nazi colleagues would come knocking at his daughter 's door
you 're wrong . i saw her betra@@ y us at vin@@ ci@@ gu@@ erra .
the meeting is confirmed .
the only way she could stay in the game .
if you can catch him .
we don 't even know which boat we 're looking for .
he died five years ago ...
submarine surfaces at 0@@ 800 . gives us 20 minutes , gentlemen .
i have an idea which might make things quicker .
di@@ ade@@ ma , this is napoleon solo .
earlier today ... i killed your husband .
ramp it up , please , solo .
but you don 't think it 's very weird , do you , har@@ lo ?
you took a piece of white felt ..
and now it 's dry ..
and since i like my face just the way it is .
i may see dead people , but then , by god , i do something about it
i 'm sorry , sir , but i don 't have a " go easy " gear .
hot at all , or@@ fic@@ er var@@ ner .
i believe in a higher power and the after@@ life .
others do .
don 't worry , penny .
i 'm sorry your life was so short .
here we are again .
most of it was not my fault .
yes , i know but he had to be stopped right now ..
that 's what penny wanted to tell me . that 's why she hadn 't left yet .
they know when death is coming and want to watch .
they want extreme , oper@@ atic violence and terror .
do you see death in me ?
and a long , happy life for you , okay ?
wearing ? i don 't know .
i 'm walking back to it right now .
well , i 'm not like most people .
it 's gone now .
so , is fungus bob a man or something new in the neighborhood ?
did you check the refrigerator for any severed heads ?
where else would you expect to find severed heads ?
stor@@ my , stor@@ my , someone 's here . i got to go .
august 14th .
that 's tomorrow . what happens tomorrow ?
get out of there , od@@ die .
i guarantee you hell on earth is coming to pic@@ o m@@ undo .
that 's just because i 've got such great respect for your balance , sir .
there 's a little bit of bull@@ shit in it . a little .
odd this is one of our newer officers .
all right , well , you do agree that he 's strange and suspicious , right ?
you 'd already be there .
only because you 're never wrong ,
she 's the one
i love to hear me say it .
since when are we living together ?
oh , i guess i didn 't think " let 's put a pin in it " meant " yes . "
what !
it 's him ? you 're sure ? sure , i 'm sure !
not this guy .
my blood-@@ hey , odd
i finished that trin@@ ket you asked for .
no , i said .
i get in the moment .
ti@@ t 's not for stor@@ my .
a bullet going through a heart .
so mad@@ ly i would cut off my hand if that made any sense as proof of love .
no one was trying to kill me , stor@@ my .
you know , this is the cra@@ zi@@ est conversation i 've ever had
time feels like a powerful black wave ..
i must run faster .
something 's wrong .
there 's going to be a massacre .
ho , all we know is it 's the same uniforms ,
god , i 'm missing something . i 'm missing a piece of the puzzle .
evening !
yeah .
the chief sent me .
i 've seen him a couple times today but no , i don 't know him .
oh , please .
you and pupp@@ ies , totally ador@@ able .
it 's about my dream , isn 't it ?
my skull was all wh@@ acked , my eye@@ ball swollen .
no place . a dream place . fuzzy .
bowling ? did you hit your head ?
lev@@ anna 's birthday is sunday , but tips are real good on a sunday .
yeah , they did .
i need em to help me see the danger coming so i can maybe prevent it .
od@@ die , will you ever leave here ?
i meant while you 're alive .
hey , hey . look , look .
it 's not that . it 's@@ -
that must be for you .
i heard the scream . she ran across my yard .
i shot the dogs
so somewhere between 8 : 00 and midnight ,
he was teaching a class from 6 : 00 to 10 : 00 .
he got home about two minutes too late .
they belong to bob rober@@ t@@ son .
i want an a. p. b. put out on this guy now !
i 'll have a search warrant in the morning
nobody showed . it was a complete waste of my time .
exactly where were you between the hours of 8 : 00 and 10 : 00 ?
and stor@@ my never actually saw you .
and the whole time in the church ,
he 's been ha@@ unting me ever since , blaming me for his death .
damn it .
it 's just me , again , ros@@ alia .
if i 'm being framed ,
before someone finds you and has a new love of te@@ sus scared into em ?
after the federal government abandoned this prison ..
rumor has it that at von zip@@ per 's bur@@ gers the fries were delicious ...
and yet , this fine dining establishment ..
welcome to the gas chamber .
but i tell her vegas is packed with dead people and bad guys
the chief
oh , my god .
who could come in here right now and not get my back up .
had to .
any road i choose could lead me right back to the same fate .
am i in god 's hands ?
have i ever told you you 've got a lot of issues ?
do you love me ?
see ? it 's working
i 'm hoping bob left a clue on his computer .
hey .
i 'm walking towards the fridge .
don 't " u@@ h-@@ huh " me . i told you ..
get out of there , od@@ die .
yeah ? well , you tell whoever 's buying it that our ice cream ..
some .
required .
let 's just say this tat@@ too is a crude ob@@ scen@@ ity .
i once had a run@@ -in with some devil wor@@ shi@@ pers .
1@@ p-@@ o-@@ d . prince of darkness
this guy bob rober@@ t@@ son got aggressive with you ?
and that police van protecting stor@@ my ?
to bust me for fungus bob 's murder .
you are eating and reading at the same time .
no ? not so good ? okay , fine .
rober@@ t@@ son , that idiot
when i find rober@@ t@@ son , i 'm gonna kill him .
looks like their plan was to jump out at the end of the mall disaster
four .
this just so happens to be my very favorite book .
viol@@ a .
odd ! ge@@ ez !
we had to pick out a birthday present for lev@@ anna .
look , your dream , it 's happening right here , right now .
ladies , i need you to take viol@@ a and get her out of here , okay ?
this made dor@@ o@@ thy so very angry ..
and dashed it all over the wicked witch
that would be neither , boss .
stick a co , maybe .
got a shan@@ k in here .
you 're not a good liar .
move along@@ .@@ deputy
in the old man 's back pocket , are you ?
he may run this place during the day ,
how are we doing it ?
in@@ fir@@ mary .
if i get that pu@@ gn@@ ac ,
which is ?
a little pre@@ p for your arrival .
the idea ?
they don 't exactly stock it at the commis@@ sary .
someone 's working on it as we speak .
our relationship transcen@@ ds race .
i can 't let you do it .
can 't be done , michael .
every step 's already been mapped out .
you may have the blue@@ prints of this place ,
as far as these guys are concerned ,
okay , if you 're a reporter ..
oh . you family ?
we were in a relationship a few years back .
because the victim was the vice president 's brother .
that 's not what i meant .
lincoln worked for stead@@ man 's company .
two weeks later , stead@@ man 's shot dead .
what 's up there in that in@@ fir@@ mary that you need so bad ?
thought we had an understanding .
you made it pretty clear you ain 't blood .
nice looking piece of steel , bit of work .
well , maybe you 're one of them milk chickens ,
maybe we ough@@ ta take a look at them in@@ sides and find out .
i want in .
did you just say you 're in ?
you know the old saying , don 't you ?
whatever it takes .
you have to prove yourself before we trust you with the heavy artillery .
gates closing
closer it gets to an execution ,
it was a closed trial , so no one outside of the courtroom saw it .
maybe they got it right .
open up . badge !
it 's my girl 's birthday .
you gotta let me call her ! please !
i seen your k@@ icks , su@@ cre .
please !

what are you talking about ?
what do you mean , like , go home ? i mean , you just got here .
you got to move on with your life .
i really don 't have time .
it 's come to our attention that you made a foil request
records show that you made a du@@ pe of the surveillance tape .
mind us asking why ?
she was under the impression that the guy was innocent .
don 't pull that card on me .
she says she used to date crab sim@@ mons .
you want to hear what i have to say ,
you want to hear what i have to say or not ?
over here
we 'll stay out here in the open where they can 't get to us .
only reason why i 'm talking to you
crab didn 't use . he had a bad heart .
i mean , don 't you think it 's just the slightest bit of a coincidence
things they didn 't want to get out .
like who was really behind that hit that night .
they were just pa@@ wns in a big game
you 're trapped in that little hole of yours .
who 's my 1 : 00 ?
better late than never , right ?
we 'll see about that .
what it is you 're doing up there .
oh , you 're the best husband ever !
i guess .
boy , when was the last time stuart cleaned this place ?
oh , okay , i 'm about to suck something up .
ho@@ wi@@ e , i don 't want to play leg@@ o , to@@ en@@ ail or pill anymore .
yeah , i know what you meant .
i don 't wanna .
portable x-ray tech to e.@@ r .
oh . it 's dr@@ .@@ sweethe@@ art. but what can i do for you ?
or something or or a p.@@ p. ?
that 's the ticket .
okay , well , hold on . let me see .

oh , okay , good , good .

we got rid of the crazy bat ! let 's go !
sid will be crushed .
so , we 're headed inland . and gran@@ ny is just dead weight .
well , that explains a lot about sid .
hey ! can you chew this thing for me ?
your family was wiped out by an asteroid . sorry .
what diego is trying to say is ..
they only wanted to find you so you could take care of gran@@ ny .
that 's just crazy . that 's just .
she 'll out@@ live us all , you know that , right ?

okay , a lot scared .
yeah , i was pretty scared , too .
do you want to walk with me tomorrow ?
you want to walk with me ?
so , i figure it can 't really go worse than that , right ?
just one thing .
two words , anger management .
diego 's right . we found the way home .
sure we do . it 's right there .
you want to pirate a pirate ship from pirates .
wait a minute , maybe we can help each other .
no , no , it 's okay . we 're not going to hurt you .
you got no idea what i 'm saying , do you ?
yeah , nice try jungle jim .
thank you .

there 's the old bear . gr@@ r !
i made mom throw a party with a whole farm theme .
cam thinks i look down on his farm life .

why it matters , we don 't want no dirty guns , jerry .
yo , look , they 're clean , all right ?
why you acting so nervous , man ? you fish@@ in ' on us , jerry ?
what the hell are you tal@@ kin ' about , man ?
hey ! put your gun down !
we 're not cops , all right ? we work for anto@@ ine vall@@ on .
shut up ! shut up ! what 'd you say ?
now , to that effect ,
we need to give americans a product they can love .
sir , i have dis@@ sec@@ ted this bill . there are no loopholes .
forget machines .
americans don 't want a machine
you 're not you because of your legs , your arms , your hands .
it 's your brain 's capacity to process information that makes you who you are .
i 've never played with these .
all you have to do is let it out .
who do you think 's gonna be investigating you ?
i 'm gonna have ' em in brac@@ el@@ ets within a month , man .
cameras of@@ r
i 'm sorry .
as@@ sh@@ ole
pass
your armor , state-of-the-art , but not inv@@ ul@@ ner@@ able .
multiple hits , and guess who ends up in the recycling bin ?
that count . it 's who 's handling them .
you think you can do this ?
just stick to my job ? combat robots are my job , doc .
26 billion .
i 've looked forward to meeting you , detective .
well , we funded this program to give men like you a second chance .
you hit me , you get a ticket back home
but make no mistake , tin man , my gun will .
the em@@ -@@ 20@@ 8@@ s will try to maneuver you so mat@@ to@@ x can get a clear shot .
if mat@@ to@@ x hits you , everything but your life support will shut down .
i don 't know about that . i 've been through a lot .
i say we go on three .
how 's it going down there ?
wow .
his software is faster . his hardware is stronger .
least i know you 're the right color now .
we 're expecting people from every corner of the city
is he a changed man ?
alex , we 're gonna upload the entire dp@@ d database into your brain .
all right .
drop the levels until i tell you to stop .
pull the footage . put it on a loop .
everything
i 'd like to see him .
look , i won 't lie to you .
i looked in his eyes and i couldn 't see my husband .
he 's responding to drugs differently now .
just give me a little more time .
this goes for every squad in every department .
no arguments , no complaints .
i said no complaints ! and i mean it . now
john big@@ gs is target number one .
should be ready to move in on my request .
murphy .
i 'm fine , sergeant .
well , look , i mean , the tide is definitely turning
but , i think our next guest will have a different point of view .
senator , thank you for joining us .
senator , do you know what this is ?
our polls at nov@@ ak@@ ele@@ ment@@ .com are tight at 50-@@ 50 .
it 's about whether america 's willing to give robots
this sea change we 're witnessing , and it is a sea change ,
has the us senate become pro-@@ crime ?
no , no , 5000 .
what , you too busy to walk us in ?
where are my trip wires ? i gotta do this myself ?
i can 't move any product with this thing on the streets .
relax . the guy 's a wal@@ kin ' zom@@ bie .
he 's not going after you . we covered our tracks .
as far as i can tell , he 's still doing his job .
he 's und@@ o@@ ing what we did to him .
how is that even possible ?
alex
well , this should be interesting .
we 're not cops , all right ? we work for anto@@ ine vall@@ on .
what 'd you say ?
where 's anto@@ ine vall@@ on ?
i know you remember me , jerry .
and i got your prints all over ' em .
i also have cctv footage of you and vall@@ on the same day he tried to kill me .
it won 't work . now that his partner got hit , he 's never gonna let it go .
lewis ' hospital
you know what they do to cops in prison , man ?
how long you think before he gives you up ?
swear to christ . it was dean .
thank you for your cooperation .
now i know why we couldn 't get an arrest .
we got anything on her ?
what do you think ?
this might actually tip this thing right into the net .
even the police ,
machines , however , are corruption free .
thank you , alex , for all you 've done .
detective murphy is currently in critical condition .
at this time , om@@ nic@@ or@@ p 's sole concern is the full recovery of detective murphy .
i sincerely hope the senate makes the right vote tomorrow
he has been my mentor and my strength
so i vote yes .
that 's us ahead , 3 to 10 .
alex
alex , put down the gun .
the attempted murder of a police officer .
there was an accident
take a hint , kid ?
jay ! a thousand ways to die .
this is the last time i 'm gonna clean up your shit .
she 's a beauty .
they tum@@ ble out .. ... wit following wisdom .
grab that end
i am " recording the decline "
in the hope of preventing their extinction
big storm coming .
no , he 's not . he 's an out@@ law , just like us .
spin it .
get that dirt , all of it , clean , clean it .
away from camp .
one 's a falling angel , the other one 's a rising devil .
do you think that 's a smart play ?
quicker than tracking him , simpler .
yeah , i guess if you knew where rose and daddy was ,
he was dying to be famous .
he come to me one time , and he said
so i 'm thinking
wasn 't long before he sees the poster ,
and what he says chil@@ ls me to the bone .
" be a thousand by the ' morrow . "
and a body hit dirt . spin around
so i walk and i shoot ,
coffee .
for god 's sake . language , rose .
only thing dry 's my mouth .
you remember nothing from last night ?
bless you .
good day , sir .
scotland is far , far away .
he knows i 'm your daughter ,
the lord sensed my wavering faith .

your boyfriend did just collapse .
me stopping to fre@@ ak out
fair enough .
i 'm talking about years , decades .
but pressure or not , don 't wait too long .

yeah , it 's a big deal .
you 're genetically blessed .
and speaking from personal experience , i can say that
all right , dr. slo@@ an , i really don 't feel comfortable
let 's not pretend being beautiful 's a burden .
how about a little spar@@ kle ?
hip dislocation , fractures of his fem@@ ur ,
ke@@ p@@ ner , i need you to speak differently .
it 's your voice . it 's a little
you know , how about
it 's far more likely there 's another explanation for this .
i am .

ke@@ p@@ ner , talk to the camera

dr. bail@@ ey 's taking him up to the o.@@ r. now .

he starts a new family , stops talking the old ones .
nice . so ..
okay , well , i 've been reading up on all the side effect
do my bo@@ ob@@ s look bigger to you ?
come on , ra@@ i , it 's a " yes or no " question .
um , wait .
it has " suck " in it , so that can 't be good .
hey , shel@@ don .
we had so much fun together the last couple of months .
which makes your betra@@ yal all the more devastating .
i let you buy feminine hygiene products
shel@@ don , your fight 's with leonard .

rum@@ low , you sweep aft , find the hostages ,
circle back to rum@@ low and protect the hostages .
iet 's see
backing up the hard drive .
okay .
you 're damn right .
i didn 't lie
i 'm not obliged to do anything
soldiers trust each other . that 's what makes it an army .
last time i trusted someone , i lost an eye .
agent roman@@ off is comfortable with everything .
he had a few suggestions
the satellites can read a terrorist 's dna before he steps outside his spider hole
we can 't afford to wait that long .
tor once , we 're way ahead of the curve .
you know , i read those ssr files .
like how the hell did a french pirate
i can draw a map if it 'd help .
but this council takes things like international piracy fairly seriously .
i don 't care about one boat , i care about the fleet .
i work 40 floors away and it takes a hijacking for you to visit ?
you busy in there ?
thank you , sir .
the thing is ,
he thought i was drunk .
i thought it was an ied .
other stuff you bring back .
is it gonna be in a big suitcase , or in a little man-@@ purse ?
i 'll see you next week .
look who it is , the running man .
yeah , brother , we all got the same problems .
you lose someone ?
all vehicles stopped .

okay . bye .
thank you , but
well , i 'll keep my distance .
and i think you left your stereo on .
yeah
my wife kicked me out .
a lot of things you don 't know about me .
i 'm sorry to have to do this , but i had no place else to crash .
the honour 's mine , captain .
that photo was taken five years after nick and i met ,
so , i 'm gonna ask again .
he told me not to trust anyone .
i 'm sorry .
records
wh@@ oa , big guy .
it kind of feels personal .
give it up , rogers ! get that door open !
are you kidding me ?
stand down , captain rogers . stand down .
eyes here .
somebody 's trying to hide something
can you override it ?
slightly .
this is a program that s.@@ h.@@ i.@@ e.@@ l.@@ d. developed
no . my fi@@ ance was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations .
congratulations . where are you guys thinking about going ?
i have the exact same glasses .

if you guys need anything . i 've been aaron .
you@@ l said nine minutes . come on . relax
standard ta@@ c team .

whoever wrote the file must have used a rou@@ ter to throw people off
this building is in the wrong place .
may be where it started
if you 're already working in a secret office ,
y-@@ e-@@ s spells yes .
he 's been dead for years .
second , look around you .
in 1972 , i received a terminal diagnosis .
my mind , however , that was worth saving
s.@@ h.@@ i.@@ e.@@ l.@@ d. recruited german scientists with strategic value .
i also helped my own .
prove it
the war taught us much .
after the war , s.@@ h.@@ i.@@ e.@@ i.@@ d. was founded ,
listen , i got to fly home tonight
no , not really .
wants to be a reporter , i think . i don 't know .
doesn 't sound like much of a problem to me .
but this isn 't the place to talk about it .
thank you .
bring the car around .
agent sit@@ well , how was lunch ?
who is this ?
your other 10 o 'clock
you 're gonna go around the corner to your right .
you and i are gonna take a ride .
because that tie looks really expensive ,
never heard of it .
didn 't work so great for him , but we found a use for it .
any attempt on the director 's life had to look successful .
besides ,
buc@@ ky , no !
the man on the bridge .
you met him earlier this week on another assignment .
your work has been a gift to mankind .
and i need you to do it one more time .
and tomorrow morning , we 're gonna give it a push .
and hy@@ dra can 't give the world the freedom it deserves .
then wipe him and start over .
see , it 's stuff like this that gives me trust issues .
i don 't think the council 's accepting my calls any more
one or two won 't cut ic .
we have to assume everyone aboard those carriers is hy@@ dra .
and maybe , just maybe we can salvage what 's left .
you gave me this mission . this is how it ends .
hy@@ dra grew right under your nose and nobody noticed .
how many paid the price before you did ?
even if you had , would you have told me ?
i know , i 'm sorry . i just kind of wanted to be alone .
it was okay .
we can put the couch cushi@@ ons on the floor
come on .
the thing is , you don 't have to .
he 's gonna be there , you know .
t don ' know if i can do that .
he doesn 't know you .
you gonna wear that ?
man .
we are go on guidance .
and how was your flight ?
the ride from the airport , less so .
negative dt six . the pattern is full .
'll check it out
finally , we 're here .
attention all s.@@ h.@@ i.@@ e.@@ l.@@ d. agents ,
some of you were even ordered to hunt me down .
s.@@ h.@@ i.@@ e.@@ l.@@ d. is not what we thought it was .
alexander pierce is their leader .
they could be standing right next to you .
absolute control
unless we stop them .
but the price of freedom is high . it always has been .
and if i 'm the only one , then so be it .
did you write that down first , or was it off the top of your head ?
arrest him .
i know you er@@ ased my password .
but if you want to stay ahead of me , mr secretary ,
encryption code accepted .
charlie carrier is 45 degrees off the port bow .
hey , sam , gonna need a ride .
i just did !
i had a big breakfast .
yeah , work twice as hard and get half the rides .
come on , son . it 's not worth the risk .
he 'll be looking for a lightweight .
i 'm a lightweight .
not bad . once again .
ok , black elastic has been scrat@@ ched from race six .
i 'll make you a cup@@ pa .
listen .
but the odds are so long .
use your knees . use your hands .
it 's all about strength .
it 's not about strength . it 's about positioning .
you push up the neck with the heel of your hands .
good !
yeah , he is .
yeah , he has .
better .
that depends on whether you give me one .
yes " she "
no , we 've covered that , ru@@ sty
nathan ?
dad asked you to be my manager , didn 't he ?
ok , yes , he did , but i 'm not supposed to tell you .
yes ?
gee , i don 't know . she 's pretty busy .
ok . she 'll be there . bye .
i 'll call you back .
think that 'll show under the dress ?
you need to call the owners directly .
i 'm trying to get an outfit for your sister 's wedding
have you called your father yet ?
well , please try harder . you 're both as stubborn as each other .
i have tried twice . he hasn 't even tried at all .

or you could just look into my eyes .
you got a lot of no@@ stri@@ l hairs .
i am .
ra@@ i . he really wants to see this movie .
i know . i want to make him feel bad .
the spiral of scales open in
so , why do you feel you need to save these things ?
and then it feels like
it ends with dinosaurs .
i don 't .
that will accomplish what ?
yes , b@@ ree believed in old-fashioned values .
each new morning in subur@@ bia brings with it
little white lies , told not to hunt ...
.. but to make life more pleasant .
oh , for god 's sake , this is un@@ believable .
of course , every now and then ,
we know you want to trust mike ,
all we know is
well , i wouldn 't put it past them .
he 's a good guy . i know him .
honestly . i don 't think mike did it either ,
but ... we will do whatever you want us to do .
shall i just dial 9@@ 11 ?
there was a murder .
will you just call ?
i 'm having a party .
well , you gotta come . i ... you 're the reason i 'm doing this .
but you really gotta go .
you want to mo@@ w my lawn for free ?
i could do everything john did for you .
why ?
if any bush needs trim@@ ming , he takes care of it .
mrs. sol@@ is , please .
he 's under house arrest .
hey , guys . this isn 't a hockey r@@ ink .
hi , honey . how was your day ?
oh , tom , i am so sorry .
i 'm peter@@ son 's " go-@@ to guy . "
du@@ gg@@ an 's been there for less than two . i am not gonna beg .

nobody respects a shrinking violet .
mine is quiet but ... effective .
no , i 've been really busy grocery shopping .
how about dinner tonight ?
dinner ... tonight ? um .
can you hold these a sec ?
you have the right to remain silent .
you have the right to consult an attorney ...
z@@ ach young 's throwing a pool party saturday night .
and ever since he moved back , you 've been miserable .
the walls between our bedro@@ oms are paper thin .
mike !
uh .... . yeah . yeah . i 'm a little bit embarrassed .
no . not really . no .
i told the police
you don 't think i killed mrs. hu@@ ber ?
i could never think you killed anybody ,
jail 's kin@@ da gross .
more travel ?
now you 're gonna have , what , twice the workload ?
you should have consulted with me .
i thought this was an in-house position .
look , wait . wait . i know what this means to you .
if i don 't make vice president now ,
so was mine . but i 'm here , aren 't i ?
she said you broke up with her
i said that . but it was just an excuse .
really :
but the truth is , there 's someone else .
unless you 're really firm with her ,
better still , be brutal .
i 'll be dead inside a year .
so , who 's the woman they think you killed ?
the cops are all over me .
if i am close . i don 't see it .
one of those trails will lead to de@@ id@@ re .
you know , my buddy and i have been
we 're all in denial about something .
thanks .
uh .. just so you know ,
did you feel anything ?
you 're definitely gay .
i 'm sure of that .
you want a co@@ ffe ? i 'm gonna go for a co@@ ffe .
no . she 's just a suc@@ ker .
please , i just spent an hour blowing out my hair .
i do know his dad well . his name is cooper ,
you tell cooper you 're sorry . you tried .
i have a surgery .
and how are you supposed to argue with someone
brow@@ n-@@ haired girl , you re up .
you made your interns come up with study questions ?
a 12-@@ year-old boy fell off his bike ,
we just gave you some drugs for the pain . okay .
what do you think , dr. torres ?
i-i don 't know . is it ?
no , you tell me , dr. grey .
i mean , yeah .
grey , here 's how it 's gonna work .
you 're gonna decide our course of action .
you in or you out ?
oh . best ?
i have a finger here .
no , a viable finger .
i-@@ is that bad or good ?
that 's good .
i think we should take this thing off
why is time a factor ?
tick to@@ ck , dr. grey .
maybe you should refrain from calling him a jack@@ ass .
maybe i should ask him .
yeah .
after .
most people would 've considered dropping a bomb
well , uh , you proposed , and we were married like 12 hours later .
yeah ,
that 'll buy us a few minutes .
i can give you guys 15 minutes ,
we 've operated on worse .
i know . i-@@ it 's clear that she is passionate ...
you know , it tells me that she 's passionate enough to try harder .
you need to see that for yourself ,
i mean , thank you .
let 's take a break .
i want something .
there 's a guy who got his hand stuck in a meat grin@@ der .
wouldn 't mind seeing that .
okay , morgan , you had an acute m@@ .i .
are you kidding ? i-i don 't have any of the risk factors .
we need to get you upstairs right now .
we need to repair the dis@@ section immediately .
and needs surgery for a coronary artery dis@@ section .
how do you know about morgan ?
there 's my ride .
if morgan needs surgery , then why are you here ?
and he can learn to re@@ balance .
this is a good fix . i know it is .
dr. torres , it has to be .
that is why we 're gonna use the second toe .
really ?
all right . tell me what you 're trying to do .
take my toe already .
i ... think the toe will be fine .
so ...
i am really good at it .
oh , dr. slo@@ an , if you let your resident
leave the o.@@ r ...
get out of the way ! move ! move !
wait . is that for the peter@@ son baby ?
all right . get out@@ ta the way !
cra@@ p

the ip@@ ad 's over there . do what you got to do with the ip@@ ad .
i really gotta take a shower . i gotta get myself washed .
so what i want you to do if that door@@ bell rings , okay ..
yeah , i 'm trying to be sad about that .
let 's see , what 's next ?
this is the magic marker
and that 's why you 're not on a list for my tree fort .
i 'll give you a hint .
well , you should be .
you know what that means ?
amy , i was off by a factor of 10,000 .
yeah , well , they shouldn 't have .
there must be some resonance
shel@@ don cooper does not get lucky !
it doesn 't matter .
for the most part , i really try to disrupt
that 's what you wanna look for .
as you can see ,
we just try not to take too much of one thing .
this disturbing creature is my camer@@ aman , al@@ ec .
dude , i don 't think you understand how dangerous this is .
we 're breaking so many laws just by being here .
but isn 't that part of the fun , almost getting caught ?
wanna play the word game ?
something to fucking do .
i have to get out , i have to get out !
i got you , i got you !
okay . okay . it 's on . just breathe .
i thought i grabbed the right one , i just , i ...
we got company .
this isn 't right . i 'm ph@@ oning her .
the two of you ...
no one 's used to talking across channels .
we would have to isolate and evacuate the president , the vp ,
hospitals , nursing homes .
food supplies d@@ win@@ dle fast .
now we 're talking martial law .
just to be sure of what we 're really dealing with .
but if one more person tests positive , we will enact a full-scale response .
there comes a day when the teacher realizes he 's got nothing left to give .
proud ?
i 'm going back to africa .

slow down there , honey . what is this ? swedish ?
come on , baby . let the old gus give him a lesson in international relations .
it 's all i have . i swear !

she is dangerous .
it may be my only relative .
will not create problem so , are you ?
but i can not answer the dog .
uncle j@@ or-@@ el was like my father .
and so my father also built a ship .
and he and my mother would come soon after .
as the asteroid moved me the galaxy
know not .
k@@ al-@@ el has enemies who would try everything to destroy it .
maybe not intentionally .
i was wrong .
my treasure , you are a best warrior of ap@@ ok@@ oli@@ ps .
the almighty dark@@ se@@ id ?
fu@@ ries !
call the dogs to clean up the mess .
never do that .
the views show the precursor kara danger .
i hope it is rational .
and we wait ?
can i call you at any time .
do@@ om@@ sday judgement .
wait ! the tube .
nobody to blame .
let 's go to ap@@ ok@@ oli@@ ps . we need your help to get there .

i 'll go with you .
you need me , therefore swallow .
there is no better place than home .
did you know dark@@ se@@ id are we here ?
well , i think that was a warm up .
we all know what is our task
i think we will by land .
may not be the right time , but you were always an inspiration .
well , well . the gang 's all here .
although personally , i 'm anxious to see it die .
but considering the situation , would be redundancy .
to try .
damn . take the head of the attacker to dark@@ se@@ id .
hail dark@@ se@@ id !
it must be . i co@@ ached the .
i do not want to go .
i will not fight you .
what 's wrong with the beast ?
take off your armor .
let me kill you , grandma .
i like to win the cake and eat it .
as i said , grandma ?
it 's what is scheduled to do .
dark@@ se@@ id 's evil .
or just brought up the evil that exists in me ?
and it 's good . nothing else matters .
when you are strong , i take it somewhere .
where can you be yourself .
it seems correct .
i 'll miss you more than you can imagine .
perhaps because , as precursor , have seen something worthwhile in me .
try not to dis@@ appoint her .
you will always have a home here .
one day you asked me if i remembered the name of my mother .
kal , i 'm ready .
still owes me a computer .
always have to say the last word .
decl@@ an ... decl@@ an re@@ illy is his name .

a bit much , yes .
and despite the greatest efforts of a whole army of academics ,
the language is developing faster than our progress .
is that too much , max ?
i submit that the extraordinary , the unconventional ,
but we need something more than imp@@ assi@@ oned advocacy .
qualifications , yes . well , um ...
beyond those , uh , i have an intimate knowledge of the romance tongues ,
i have sufficient knowledge of hebrew and syri@@ ac
forgive me .... for ratt@@ ling on . i 'm sure you have questions .
i 'll make a fist of it , uh , on the ho@@ of , as it were .
or perhaps the middle dutch , kle@@ ver ,
forgive me for keeping it from you .
that 's all mine . ada , the entire language .
but it 's so sudden .
is this truly what you wish ? for all of us ?

this one , didn 't you hear , he che@@ ats on the times cross@@ word .
how many new words for things that yet to be imagined ?
no language can ever be permanently the same , james .

i so did not understand the ending of lost
i 'm sorry i was so hard on you .
i believe in each one of you !
and every time i talked about walking away ,
and i 'll wait for you at lunch break and after school ,
there 's nothing you can do .

what progress have you made ? what have you been doing ?
i 've been in my mind palace , of course .
run@@ nin@@ q an experiment . how would i have solved the crime ,
i had all the details perfect .
no , he can do this , i 've seen it .
yes , and i need to get back there .
maybe there are one or two things that i know that you don 't .
did you make a list ?
that wai@@ st@@ coat is clearly newer than the jacket .
of what ?
no , it 's not that , he goes into a sort of tr@@ ance .
we have an agreement , my brother and i , ever since that day .
i alleviate bore@@ dom and
you could die !
oh , i suppose we should .
ye@@ p , that 's where i 'm looking .
i think it would be a good idea .
could you all just shut up for five minutes !
i was nearly there before
sher@@ lock , listen to me .
holmes , how could you ?
it seemed obvious to me
help from her friends .
i was talking to mary .
he likes to keep an eye on his mad si@@ bling .
of course it hasn 't ,
only now , i 'm afraid .
time i sp@@ ed up . enough chat@@ ter , let 's concentrate .
what do they want to accomplish ?
this time , should anyone attempt to identify her ,
die to prove a point ?
every war has suicide missions and make no mistake , this is war .
the invisible army ho@@ vering at our elbow ,
but an army nonetheless ,
so you see , watson , my@@ cro@@ ft was right .
she was dying .
em@@ elia ri@@ co@@ le@@ tti .
so she decided to make her death count .
ho@@ op@@ er !
for the record , holmes , she didn 't have me fool@@ ed .
that would take weeks to find , if those records even exists .
got it .
i need to know i was right , then i 'll be sure .
yes .
my investigation was the fantasy ,
i need to try !
the corpse they substituted for her after the so-called suicide ?
but where ?
but that .. that 's exactly what they must have done .
they found a body ,
it 's why we came here . i need to know .
this is important to me !
john ...
we have a case , we have a real-@@ life problem right now .
just let me do this .
that 's how you got in this state !
i 'm not playing this time , sher@@ lock . not any more !
i 'm taking mary home .
more than likely .
we do have slightly more pressing matters to hand , little brother .
fans , we 're gonna go now to the ri@@ din ' dirty buc@@ king ch@@ ute ..
go , u@@ ke !
for over a year , an injury has sid@@ el@@ ined him .
he has a long way to go .
we 'll see .
yeah , go !
hey , larry .
luke , hey , man . how are you doing ?
i know it feels good to get a win under your belt , doesn 't it ?
let me ask you . you need to come visit us .
important folk . come get a beer .
yes . okay .
you had a good night .
i got a hat just like that .
no , you hold on to it . looks better on you .
may i ?
nice to meet you , sop@@ hia .
you were the big winner tonight , right ?
oh , no . doesn 't work like that where i 'm from .
you 're buying
i 've been looking all over for you .
you really should eat something
how do you know about ruth ?
what do you care ?
i am a total failure .
father thinks that art stopped with m@@ atis@@ se and pic@@ as@@ so .
you try and raise your children right , ira ...
very good . very good .
it was nice seeing you talk like that .
hey , ruth . i need to ask you something .
i 've always wanted one since i was a little girl .
i feel this need , this responsibility ,
you can ask me now
if you marry me , you may never have a family .
the war was over .
we 're closed !
you cannot tell me what i 'm willing to give up !
i was here , cl@@ inging to the hope ..
yes , and have kids . but that 's a dream , ira .
unless you don 't love me anymore .
a chance at life together
he sure has been through a lot .
il@@ ul@@ ke .
what are you doing right now ?
everyone was always screaming in weird languages .
my pants were too short always .
growing up on a cattle ranch , everybody i knew was the same .
i 'm jealous .
i wanted to be like everyone else when i was little
i think before i met you , the closest thing i came to cattle was
you said you love the house , right ?
doesn 't look like anyone 's home .
yeah , and which one are you ?
what are you doing ?
i 'd love to . this is the most important thing to me .
this is adri@@ enne tran@@ cis
nice to meet you , luke .
no , never made it to college .
no , i can 't say that i am .
honestly ?
think there 's more bull@@ shit here than where i work
why can 't you try to fit into mine ?
it was a joke , okay ? she thought it was funny .
what if she was just trying to be polite ?
wh@@ ac ?
do you really see yourself living on a ranch ?
and what am i gonna do ?
go out with your artist friends ? go to brun@@ ch ?
there 's nothing we can do .
i did , and that 's what he said
there must be something more we can do .
you be good . okay , pal ?
maybe i 'll raise chickens ..
if that 's what you want .
anything at all . a farmer , a lawyer , an astronomer .
and who knows what they would 've done to daniel .
ruth , you are my family .
we never saw daniel again .
oh , shit .
the bull fighter 's taking the bull away in the other direction .
let me get him something to make him feel a little bit better .
264 on three bulls !
te 's awesome .
okay . gotta go .
i know !
hey , ba@@ be . i 'm walking to the taxi right now .
hi , lu@@ iz . something 's happened to luke .
um , i need to see my boyfriend , luke collins .
okay . can i at least know how he is ?
he took a pretty hard fall .
i 'll let you know .
so , are you light-@@ headed , di@@ zzy ?
i 'd like you to stay overnight for observation .
i came as soon as i heard
should be here .
yeah , me , too .
oh , really ?
look , sop@@ hia .
but you 're going to have to figure out for yourself what that 's going to be .
i think you should go .
even if that happiness no longer includes me .
always .
we focused on celebrating all the wonderful things we had
ruth@@ ie
the paintings ruth and i had collected
can i help you ?
dam@@ iel mcdonald
that was six years ago .
thank you .
physics and astronomy at the university college london .
i moved back to the states a few years ago .
i knew i had to bring you this .
you did everything you could with luke , sop@@ hia .
if we don 't have this place , where are you gonna go ?
you 're doing this for yourself .
that 's all it is .
uh , yes . this is she .
i 've been trying to reach you .
i 'm sorry , ms. dan@@ ko .
for this championship round .
luke , you will have the num@@ ber-@@ one conten@@ der ..
he is doing one of the most difficult things in sports ..
yeah , but ju@@ ke collins , he is on pb@@ p fire !
you got it ! keep riding !
hey , luke , you made the eight on ran@@ go .
one hell of a ride , son , i tell you !
luke ? luke , where you going ?
not only are these pieces sourced from local black mountain college ..
such as andy war@@ hol , pat pass@@ l@@ of , and wil@@ lem de x@@ o@@ oning
never been seen in one place like this before .
if everyone could take their seats , please .
before we begin , a personal note .
for more than 25 years .
now , tra 's will is very detailed
specifically for the occasion .
my beloved ruth .
and sharing that happiness ...
we celebrated , we achieved
we 'll start the bidding at $ 1,000 for portrait of ruth .
who has $ 1,000 for me ?
just $ 600 , folks .
that car down there has moved so much .
and then it was like shipped , like , here .
yeah , exactly .
yeah ?
and that tree is always just , like , stopping . you know ?
like , destroying this beautiful .
why ? why are you crying ?
because i 'm the right man for the job .
d@@ aff@@ y duck
yeah , it should have been two months .
victoria , we 're clearing the portfolio .
mike ho@@ well keeps trying to leave town .

god , it 's mike .
we lost two assets attempting to neutr@@ alize wis@@ em@@ an-@@ designate ho@@ well .
he was armed with a spoon , sir .
we 're not sure yet , the exact nature of the confrontation ..
i know that , phoebe .
phoebe . it doesn 't even make any sense to me .
yeah .
okay , so she said ...
so maybe just try and remember and focus and put it together .
what did the lady say ?
you 're his maid . you 're his land@@ lady .
it was just a thing .
no , i don 't want to get ... no .
he can hel@@ o us hide out and i 'm still in handcu@@ ff .
really ? well , who is , all right ?
like , and if someone who 's trying to kill you , goes , " wait .. "

and nothing else is going to happen , i promise .
why would you .. i should not be talking .
oh , my god . there 's an empty field .
yeah , but how do you know ?
i know . i know , ba@@ be .

he took my teeth .
yeah , so why do you come to my house , mike ?
crazy is as crazy does and you dragged crazy here .

it 's too late , man .
what ?
mike . . come here . come here .
you have to stay awake , all right ?
this is going to help a little bit .
i feel sleepy .

and now you 're embarrassed
'@@ cause you look pretty d@@ our for someone
he joined the army . yes , im in .
why are you trying to stop him ?
and ?
but why would you want to stop him ?
don 't you think that 's a problem ?
awesome ?
what , he 's got a drinking problem now ?
he 's that guy who gets killed cleaning his own gun .
you are going to use logic and reason
and if all of that doesn 't work , kare@@ v , you 're gonna pull out
do you think he has a shot ?
i 'm on my way have you talked to bail@@ ey

when 'd you wake up ?
she needs rest .
well , she 's not gonna heal
no , she 's my patient . i don 't care if you 're her husband .

i 'll have nelson do it .
we 'll run to city hall , we 'll come back . and we 'll do it then .
no , you know , let 's go . we gotta go
every day there 's a crisis . there 's no time .
i love you , and i do want to marry you today ,
for what ?
and in order to do that , we need to make vo@@ ws ,
i don 't .
passenger train .
i 'm going to have to catch the 6 : 30 departure .
i got to go .
try and get a little sleep .
well , dream of me .
the bomb went off just moments after the commu@@ ters boar@@ ded .
the death toll is at 144 and still rising .
and all signs point to terrorist leader mat@@ thi@@ as
the workers of the colony deserve equality .
and with over@@ population figures in the u. f.@@ b. continuing to rise ,
federal police have since attributed that bombing to this man , carl ha@@ user ,
going somewhere ? no ?
that fantasy that remains forever out of reach ?
at re@@ k@@ all , we 'll provide you
all passengers , please report to your designated gates .
wake up to the truth !
don 't let them ship you across the earth like cattle .
despite recent talks between chancellor co@@ ha@@ agen and the colony 's governor ,
the protection of our citizens will always come first .
please prepare for gravity reversal .
looks like that bomb set off a hell of a panic up here .
all factory personnel must enter through security gate 12 .
that mind
do yourself a favor , dou@@ g , stay away from them .
remember tra@@ vis from shift three ?
yeah , i do .
i don 't need to think about it .
it ain 't worth it .
maybe i need my mind mess@@ ed with .
don 't blame me .
i don 't want to be here any longer than you do , okay ?
so take all your complaints to chancellor co@@ ha@@ agen .
come on .
i trained the last guy you fired .
what are you talking about ?
your memory was er@@ ased , your mind was im@@ planted
there is no douglas qu@@ aid , there never was .
this ..
deep down , did you really believe
how would i know ?
qu@@ aid must 've known we 'd be tracking it .
oh , shit .
he 'd had major tactical training , sir .
how the hell did he get activated ?
been blown before they could get to him .
it means , it means they succeeded in giving you
you have to believe me .
get to my apartment !
loyal
now , what to do with you ?
leave her out of this . i 'm in the fucking chair !
let 's take extra care to follow the instructions , or you 'll be put to sleep .
that 's the day every rul@@ e-@@ following citizen gets a free tac@@ o and my love !
you have a great day too , president business .
fred , barry , g@@ ail , me and yo@@ l ?
wait up ! okay , i 'll meet you there .
oh , there you are .
but , uh , i don 't think you 're supposed to be here .
work site closes at 6 , it 's a hard-@@ hat area only .
" tf you see anything weird , report it immediately . "
x@@ oul 'll live . you@@ l 'll be fine .
yes , we 've told him he 'll live so he doesn 't try to escape , but , um ...
wait , what did he just say ?
wait ! there 's obviously been a mix@@ -up here . you 've got the wrong .
no , no , no !
it 's you ?
you 're not the special ! you lied to me !
you 're not even a master@@ builder , are you ?
why don 't you tell me what it is ? that way i could see if you 're right .
look , i 'm sorry , okay ? you just .
and to think i was going to follow you to the end of the universe .
quiet .
do you have any idea what that does to your colon ?
and this . and this . and this .
and what those big words in the sky were all about ?
your home , bric@@ ks@@ burg , is one of many real@@ ms in the universe .
a bunch of others we don 't need to mention .
tell me the whole thing again . i wasn 't listening
secret super weapon called .... the kra@@ gle !
to hunt down all the master@@ builders , who were always changing everything
the only thing that can stop the kra@@ gle .
it might have been that cop . he said something about the kra@@ gle
i can 't make any sense of it .
i knew that was suspicious . there 's no time to lose .
no , but thank you .
capturing all those master@@ builders ...
thank you , sir .
the one thing that can ruin my plans .
that 's super frustrating
and throw them through this window .
i wanna go it so bad .
and it 's not just you , bad cop , that keeps m@@ essing up my plans .
are you gonna be with me .
sc@@ on ?
i have a job to do .
ah , perfect .
bang , bang , ban@@ g-@@ ban@@ g-@@ ban@@ g-@@ bang !
z@@ ap , z@@ ap , z@@ ap , po@@ w . z@@ ap , po@@ w .
i made a mistake .
not unlike this tv that just showed up mag@@ ically .
and i thought to myself :
introducing the double-@@ dec@@ ker couch .
that is literally the dum@@ best thing i 've ever heard .
there must be something around here ..
if the man ur@@ p@@ stairs chose him to be the special
he doesn 't even know about the man upstairs .
that look like they 're made out of big pink sa@@ usages ?
wait . you 've seen the . ?
that 's what i was just thinking about .
well , i mean , i wasn 't asleep , so it wasn 't really a dream .
i did
to have even a fle@@ eting glimpse of the man upstairs ..
with proper training
the prophecy chose you , em@@ met .
that the prophecy says i 'm supposed to do .
then .
yes , i am .
do you think ze@@ pp@@ el@@ ins are a bad investment ?
wait a minute , partner .
these mechanical birds will get our message out .
torture weapons , poverty , le@@ ech@@ es , illiteracy .
dragon !
once we arrive at cloud cuc@@ ko@@ ol@@ and , we 'll raise an army
i call them the dogs . listen to them bark !
i just need to give the secret knock .
i 'm just gonna come right out .
here in cloud cur@@ ck@@ x@@ o@@ ol@@ and
thank you .
am very excited to work with you guys ...
and put this thing on the thing .
" really hard "
so if ye think it 'd be a good idea to return .
special .
chan the ideas of 100 .
well , technically i 'm not exactly a master@@ builder yet .
i may not have a lot of experience .
or having ideas in general .
and i 'm not what you 'd call a " creative type . "
also .
i know what you 're thinking :
this is supposed to make us feel better ?
why are you leaving ?
ab@@ ral@@ am i@@ in@@ col@@ n !
come on , guys !
you 're not even a bit special .
you 're a huge disappointment .
i was wrong
wh@@ oa . how did he . ?
i only work in black .
use the yellow bricks !
let 's get these prisoners back to lord business
hello , everybody !
mr. sh@@ acu@@ ille o '@@ neal
help us !
we 're stuck in the middle of the ocean on this couch ?
is gonna come out of nowhere and save us .
so why did you come back ?
i watched lord business ' forces completely overlook it .
oh , thank you .
why , this :
don 't like that . sounds weird
but you can 't work together as a team .
but when i had a plan and we were all working together .
now , you 're master@@ builders .
some construction paper ...
i call this
and save the world . '
i can get us anywhere .
in a spac@@ eship .
great idea . a bat
in a bat@@ -@@ spac@@ eship , or a pirate spac@@ eship or a rain@@ bow@@ -@@ spar@@ kle spac@@ eship .
that 's exactly like all the other oc@@ tan delivery spac@@ es@@ hips .
sorry , ben@@ ny . maybe next time .
yeah , but according to your precious instructions .
maybe we could find one !
are you kidding me ?
you know how per@@ tur@@ bed i get if we are not punc@@ tual .
now hold on , han .
o@@ oh , wh@@ oa , i have a boyfriend . and it is super serious . right , ba@@ be ?
yeah !
wh@@ oa ! ba@@ be !
you 're trying to bail on us !
ba@@ be ! i knew it ! i knew that .
those guys were so lame . all they did was play space chec@@ kers .
and the metal one too . all du@@ des
so we can get past the dangerous .
space id .
who are you here to see ?
is that last name " butt , " first name " your , " or is it . ?
first try !
and we 'll pl@@ under his collection of relics for disgu@@ ises .
motion sensors triggered in sector 12 .
whatever you say , boss
and save the universe .
uh , i didn 't mention that earlier ?
no ! but it might not , right ?
attention , everybody ! incoming speaker delivery !
and by the way , i found a few of your friends .
acceptable work , bad cop .
robots , destroy this old man at once .
you must know something about the prophecy .
the prophecy .
uh .. a@@ hem . hey , everybody .
i know things seem kind of bad right now .
this is em@@ met .
a face in the crowd
and i owe you an apology ...
and even though they seemed weird
than anyone else to saving the universe .
n@@ ope , he 's not .
generic construction worker ...
it 's clut@@ tering up my room .
oh , just some me@@ men@@ tos of mine .

jay says i can 't leave until i taste it .

how did either of you reach adulthood ?

but most importantly , we wanna know what you think
oh , those are for cats .
okay , i 'm gonna be honest with you guys .
all right , here 's the nut@@ shell .
lu@@ ka , no . no , swee@@ tie .
i should go .
well , this great .
we 're off the hook .
the suicide , the hand turning up behind the hospital
we have to save her from herself .
it means we go back to santa barbara
sha@@ wn !
so what 's he doing driving all the way into the hills
no , no , no , ice bar .
they 're either for tourists or es@@ kim@@ os .
let 's go get loaded for l@@ assi@@ e .
no , wait , mr. k@@ ess@@ ler .
i don 't like this , sha@@ wn .
well , you 'll just have to be extra black , then .
these mit@@ tens are aw@@ fully restrictive ,
what we should have done was waited to see if
hello .
we do , but first , i need to go .
thank you for your hospitality , ova .
well , that 's a regional term . gus prefers " playing football . "
now , you 're proving to be dangerous .
sha@@ wn , gus , what is going on ?
have you ever seen " dirty rotten s@@ coun@@ d@@ rels " ?
hey , could you do a quick pivo@@ t
okay . okay .
i got news for everybody .
i 'm not ready for you .
and what does that mean ?
what it means is that i get why you 're here ,
i absolutely will not .
mary , let me ask you ... mary ?
he 's resisting , sha@@ wn !
it seems a bit one-sided .
no g@@ ills .
you 've just been pretending this whole time ?
i mean , i still have some num@@ b@@ ness on my right side ,
why are you doing this ? is this an insurance thing ?
no and no and stop touching my scar , man .
gus . wake up , come on .
what ?
i think baby mary was a hall@@ uc@@ ination .
yeah .
i mean , the tooth and the van story ,
i stopped taking mine , but it didn 't help .
did you know there are bodies in your fields ?
what ?
they know everything .
hey , look , if they find out that i 'm still luci@@ d ,
but please don 't give me up ,
the lying was killing me . i was having panic attacks .
and apparently i spilled everything
a steep price .
how many of those ice chips did you eat ?
you kept eating them after we knew
ha ! dr. her@@ sch ...
well , hey , guys . how are we doing ?
i get to cover the night rounds
tell me that isn 't the guy i was supposed to be watching .
sha@@ wn , will you get your hand off my knee ?
someone from this ice bar
sha@@ wn , we 've done this routine before .
gus , please , i 'm going to leave the le@@ ash on this time .
ow . good news , bad news .
i saw it with me own eyes .
shot him dead@@ . with a black arrow .
ve must look to our own .
those who can stand , tend to the wounded
what then ? wh@@ ac ' we do then
bo@@ m bur ?
news of the death of s@@ ma@@ ug will have spread through the lands .
others will now look to the mountain .
what is it you know ?
it 's what i fear may come .
the or@@ c i pursued out of la@@ ke-@@ town , i know who he is .
if there is no place for ta@@ uri@@ el , there is no place for me .
it is your king 's command .
to where ?
and destroyed once and for all .
sa@@ ur@@ on can never again hold dominion over middle-@@ earth .
they have no idea what is coming
the battle for the mountain is about to begin .
i know it .
not well enough .
and yet , it is still not found !
the people of la@@ ke-@@ town have nothing
i know well enough their hardship .
they have much ... to be grateful for
that 's it .
another one
your gratitude is mis@@ placed .
i came to reclaim something of mine .
white g@@ ems of pure star@@ light .
i know an elf lord who will pay a pretty price for these .
hail , thor@@ in , son of th@@ rain .
why do you come to the gates ... of the king under the mountain armed for war ?
like a robber in his hold ?
my lord
will you not speak with me ?
on behalf of the people of la@@ ke-@@ town ..
a share of the treasure .
i will not treat with any man .
does it not tell you our cause is just ?
and in return , you brought upon them only ruin and death .
a bargain was struck !
what choice did we have but to bar@@ ter our birth@@ right
in mortal danger .
you know nothing ... of wiz@@ ards .
but sometimes a storm .. is just a storm .
our enemy has summoned his full strength .
because we forced hi .
are the arch@@ ers in position ?
give the order .
you , bow@@ man !
is gold so important to you ?
it won 't come to that .
to give you ... this .
the king 's je@@ wel .
how is this ... yours to give ?
why would you do this ?
i 'm not doing it for you .

with a single coin .
as if i were some low@@ ly dwarf lord
i am not my grandfather . i am not my grandfather .
i lost it .
and i 'm very fond ... of you .
in a wide world after al
4 : 00 , your honor .

okay , hold on . nobody move , i got this !
every car alarm , every whistle of the wind
i just want to net@@ fli@@ x and mom .
yeah , thanks again for that , but it didn 't help .
okay , that is it !
i tried to find happiness in the bottom of a bottle .
but enough about how i felt .
for some of us , that was the last best time .
it didn 't make any sense .
a lot of things ha@@ unt me .
the roads were very icy .
when i came to , the doctor told me we 'd been in a horrible
mitchell , this is the theater . have some respect .
mitchell , what are you doing ?
oh , my beautiful b@@ ess .
never had any children , of course .
to see each of you .
yeah , they never say it .
they find little ways to express it .
you have to learn how to ive on crum@@ bs .
right .
it 's okay .
she invited a few of us out for coffee .
yeah , no , uh , not fun , actually .
it really just seemed like she wanted an audience .
grab it .
joe 's sleeping in the couch .
and that no one discovered the body until it reached ac@@ ap@@ ul@@ co ?
and that they then sent her body back in a rub@@ ber@@ maid cooler ..
before tina 's husband could even claim it
i mean , i write reminders about my reminders .
hey , how is your daughter doing ?
thanks for asking .
yeah , you had pins in your legs for over a year .
your doctor wants me to write an assessment
i have shown up to every fucking appointment .
okay , great .
and all of a sudden , i see a lady climb up on the ledge .
what did you do ?
and i was like , " don 't jump ! don 't jump ! "
it was@@ -@@ it was a pretty long time .
maybe .
or subjective personality traits ,
i just came here for nina 's address .
the one who killed herself . yeah , that nina .
well , remember when i said i was kidding about the i@@ aw@@ suit ?
this is a very good soap . no buy at home .
do you have prescriptions ?
well , at the border , unless you have prescriptions , they will take them away .
we open up mary here .
you 're a rich white woman . have you ever been caught at anything ?
i have problems with anything religious .
they are my friends , ir@@ ma and inno@@ cen@@ cia .
excuse me . i 'll be right back .
good-@@ bye .
okay . good-@@ bye , jason .
not ton@@ igh@@ t. wouldn 't be prudent .
i know . i will call her tomorrow
prove it .
i lied about nina not leaving a note .
sil@@ v@@ ana told me about your accident .
well , sil@@ v@@ ana needs to keep her fat mouth shut .
i pay her to care about me .
and don 't you get senti@@ mental either .
i can barely save myself and my kid .
sil@@ v@@ ama ?
sil@@ v@@ ana , you have this habit ...
but he is a friend , no ?
one of the last operating dri@@ ve-@@ in theaters
how about that apple sauce ?
who ?
tou@@ che , im@@ el@@ da .
but i do like my shoes .
not in an ironic way .
and i fell over 10,000 feet to the ground .
what 's in la ?
yeah . that 's a sad story .
old enough .
thank you .
as a precaution , no names .
they know me as a banker , slightly bent ,
but before they put their money in ,
50,000 from each of us
not that i expect a straight answer .
well , it 's rather difficult to say
and to your point , um .
oh , dear . the first to break a rule .
russians
i didn 't say that , did i ? m@@ mm ?
uh , no . i wouldn 't want to intru@@ de .
uh , i 've got something to say .
we got off on the wrong foot .
poor so@@ d didn 't even know i was there .
your grandmother 's throwing caution to the wind .
this is your go@@ ing-@@ away dinner .
that 's right ! one 's interest , one 's assets , family .
i don 't think you could call it a strategy
so , if we include the savings , the fund , and the house ,
may i call you betty ?
is there a risk
so , your money would be helping those in need .
double my money in five years ?
oh , yes , what 's that ?
you mean combine my money with roy 's ?
well , yes , but we were married .
investing with vincent is like winning the lottery
stephen ?
oh , did you ?
why didn 't you let me know you were back ?
stand clear of the doors , please
if the russians were wired
greedy old roy .
give me back my 100,000 qu@@ id .
sorry ?
will you say that again ?
i didn 't expect there 'd be quite so many balloons .
still , preferable to being shot at .
i think someone 's getting cran@@ ky
i think i 'm gonna go exploring
do you know how many people were shot
i suppose you 're about to tell me .
went the day well ?
oh , it 's just , i took a tum@@ ble .
yes . my name 's roy cour@@ tn@@ ay .
and i 've left my key@@ pad at home .

which t-@@ bag has .
finding where the break@@ -in is doesn 't mean anything
algeria ? turkey .
you know what ? get with the program .
uh , his name 's er@@ ol ta@@ ba@@ k .
put this on the dash .
that 's our guy .
now , i have something else i need you to do for me .

he blew this whole thing for all of us .
i wish i were .
leave a message .
call me back . call .. me .. back as soon as possible .
officer ma@@ thers , he 'll wait with you .
if you could just wait with me , ma 'am .
what 's going on ?
this is a nice memorial .
there 's a lot of bad people out there .
well , the priority for me is working out custody of benjamin .
no , i don 't want to do this over the phone .
how about we meet in your office in about an hour ?
or@@ son ?
she 's small-@@ time .
wait . so you 're just gonna leave a drug dealer in our house ?
well , good , when they drop by for their inspection ,
and after all , we 're family .
well , yes , since my nephew austin is benjamin 's biological father ,
she went after carlos and mike and karl .

what are you gonna do ?
you 're the one who asked me to go shopping .
how about this one ?
i just .... it 's good for us to hang out . i enjoy it .
no . all my idea .
let 's go home .
oh , honey , we 're about to have dinner .
but it 's not a competition .
so , howard , are you-@@ interested ?
if i could control robot arms with my brain ,
my ride home with you was hell@@ ish .
no , thank you .
well , then out you go .
well , ever since amy started working with howard ,
and has she been home ?
does it frustr@@ ate you ?
you know , it 's okay to feel frustrated
ah , maybe it 's not that big a deal .
now , why don 't you go wash up ,
howard 's really excited about his work ,
come on , we don 't need to lie to each other .
i have a tee@@ thing baby , i 'm pregnant ,
no , no , no . he 'll just think that means
okay . let 's see , let 's see .
well , sometimes , but .. problem for another day .
" let him have ownership of his choices .
" i can drive you in two hours or you can take an u@@ ber "
wow , it worked .
and now they 're working on a saturday ?
this whole thing is m@@ add@@ ening .
i don 't have time to listen to you complain .
" shel@@ don , why are you here ? "
sounds like we 've earned ourselves a break .
you know , that 's your greatest magic trick ,
okay , look , i 'm on the air force web site ,
oh , please , that 's not how it works .
the military just shows up and takes over .
i 'm sorry , you find this funny ?
boy , that was terrible .
when are they gonna fix your elevator ?
all right , you two , don 't start .
can you please not ruin it ?
this is how the u.s. military works .
it could be foreign military pretending to be american .
i also love the enemies of america .
oh , of course not .
so , alfred , what is it that you do for a living ?
i study ancient peoples and cultures .
he probably feels
there 's two pages just for des@@ ser@@ ts .
all f@@ right .
howard , keep in mind that the more p@@ assion@@ ately
hi . sorry i 'm late .
i 'll get you a plate .
oh , yes , the waitress sl@@ ash actress
well , he sent me a football and a cat@@ cher 's mit@@ t for christmas ,
yeah , i gotta put a stic@@ ker over that .
oh , not at all .
come on , i mean , you 're not upset

eight years ?
i 've been responsible for my own orgas@@ ms since 1982 .

it 's a conversation starter .
oh , is it ? we 're conver@@ sing .
what i want is to be departing the star@@ ship enterprise
i 'll comfort you from over here .
thank you , that 's very comfor@@ ting .

the comfor@@ ting part is that the germans
you 're right , i do feel better .
just remember , leonard , where your biological family
if it 's any consol@@ ation , i 'm not happy about it either .
okay , now this time try drinking it all at once .
i 've been responsible for my own buzz since 2003 .
not my business .
we the left-@@ eye boys !
you got real pretty eyes , miss .
can we borrow one ?
who are you , s@@ lick ? the boyfriend ?
he did mention a singing wind@@ mill .
where 'd he say it was ?
whatever that was .
he liked to laugh ...
my father is in trouble .
i 'll rob the bank with you .
what 's happening right now ?
will you stop br@@ ushing me if i say yes ?
then you can help .
that 's a good amount of money you want us to lend you .
i feel kin@@ da guilty about this , bur@@ ro , taking money from nice people .
i feel less guilty now .
this is a bank !
i know what you 're thinking , but not yet .
how is this jack@@ ass stuck ?
it doesn 't make sense , it 's not logical .
oh ! you are leaving !
oh , no . oh , no .
i 'm li@@ l pete .
i didn 't know my pa .
that 's a lot of money , isn 't it , mama ?
oh , yeah , that 's right . i 'm writing you a letter .
i want him to teach me how you make babies .
how can you see a fly in the dark ?
that was some my@@ s@@ tical shit , man .
that 's what i was aiming for .
he deserved to know he was not welcome here .
that had some impact on you .
that 's wonderful .
i did .
i thought that , like , tonight was gonna be fa@@ j@@ ita friday
he 's giving himself six bullets to the head !
i was just trying to knock him out .
i don 't think he 's waking up from that one .
you did ! you did a number there .
hey ! hey !
here you are , danny . it 's an old ap@@ ache remedy .
my father taught me .
not our father . screaming eagle .
he 's the kin@@ dest .. wis@@ est man i 've ever known .
frank stock@@ burn , the out@@ law ?
without a doubt .
i played him in e@@ ze@@ ki@@ el grant 's annual valentine 's day game down in y@@ uma .
he happen to mention anything about what his biggest score was ?
i 'll make you a deal .
deal . tommy dun@@ son .
welcome , my friends , to the first ever playing of a new sport .
on this field , two ten-@@ person teams will engage in a battle of ..
only 18 people here .
one team will go out onto the field to play defense
and hasn 't stopped yet .
wish he 'd glue the head back on my pec@@ ker .
okay , never mind all that . okay ?
we 're traveling with a friend of theirs who , uh ...
well , they headed up north to the tur@@ quo@@ ise trail .
looking forward to seeing your man beg for his life ?
he 's gonna be like ,
excuse me , sheriff .
so it 's all right if i do this to your wife ?
you sick bast@@ ard .
you 're in for a real treat today . this is gonna be so much fun .
but there 's a chance he 's not . you got to meet him , tommy .
even if it was just for five minutes , it 'd be worth it .
what 's risky ?
it 's in y@@ uma tomorrow night .
we all will .
for dad !
i 'll give you a hint . one-@@ hour massage , no charge .
you know what gift i 'd really love ?
nothing ruins a good poker game more ...

you apples didn 't fall far from this tree .
if you knew who we really were ,
i 'm still holding an ace .
this little beauty stum@@ bled into our camp a few days ago .
i 'm gu@@ essing this means you don 't want me to be your best man no more , huh ?
wait , this kid 's half kar@@ d@@ ashi@@ an .
wow , that baby 's already famous for doing nothing ..
no , what i found is a site where we can apply
there 's also a min@@ or@@ ity-@@ owned category .
any chance he could be native american ?
wait .
we are white ,
i was thinking of a recommendation
will you ask andy ? i can 't , he 's my ex .
i hate asking men for things .
you were born here ? how old are you ?
yeah , you were born in a wal@@ mart , right ?
hey . caroline .
for the record , i did not chase andy away .
right , that 's why i helped him move out
so self-@@ involved .
he left last night without a pe@@ ep .
oh , i was worried you two wouldn 't make it .
okay , fine . give it back .
what about sophie ? she owns a small business ,
i mean , when we worked for her ,

i think i can help you with that .

i defend them .
i mean , trip says we 're gonna win ,

on land .

i have a request to make .
i want to cut open your brain
don 't call her my girlfriend .
now that it 's out there ..
by the way , if you say no ,

that 's , uh , b-@@ flat , for those who don 't have perfect pitch .
he has been presented with a wonderful opportunity ,
well , i mean it .
and that 's how you get a tooth@@ paste commercial . cheers .
it was really nice of you to try to be happy for leonard .
you 're jo@@ king , right ?
i joke about golf and mexic@@ ans .
first time 's the hardest .
well , i 'm not sure i 'm ready to say good-@@ bye to this guy yet .
i did bring along a fab@@ ulous bottle of ' 82 bor@@ de@@ aux

phil dun@@ phy .
oh , dun@@ phy , i can play you like a uk@@ ul@@ ele ,
let me stop you right there .
first of all , i 'm gonna take you out to a very nice dinner .
and then i 'm gonna lay you down by the fire ...
if you guys are talking about the house ,
she knows so much more about the things that he loves .
if she learns how to fro@@ th his cap@@ pu@@ cc@@ ino ,
hell , he may never form
and it doesn 't matter if man@@ ny likes her .
you are wrong , jay . i 'm not going to dump her .
you 're going to marry her ?
n@@ ailed it .
she is the most amazing woman i 've ever known .

me , too .

but wait , my love .
that 's him . hit it .
hey , guys . sorry it took me so long .

show@@ time !
hey ! thought i 'd just swing by and see how it 's going .
oh , my god .
alex was right . you are into him .
we go see around city .
i mean , it will cost a fortune .
not another cra@@ p ga@@ men@@ o , stu@@ d poker this time .
how did you get all the money to play in such a big poker game ?
i 'm telling you this is why i have to go to vegas .
i 've always wanted you to have to show me around manhattan .
ro@@ land , this is ash@@ le@@ igh en@@ right from yar@@ dley .
the screening is all set up . we are running on a really tight schedule .
i just want to say you 're by far the most interesting american director .
i write in the arts for a paper
film is my total thing . i 've seen all the american classics .
technically , he is not european , technically , he 's , obviously , japanese .
what college are you from ?
i know it well , my first wife went there .
to tell you the truth i didn 't deserve her , and
neither , either , nor ya@@ wn .
i guess , it 's probably more ya@@ wn that either .
tuc@@ son , arizona .
i was afraid you 'd ask .
is that bad ?
" republicans , the one percent . " but we are not .
that 's how my ashley was .
my first wife .
face saving changes .
i guess i could shift my lunch plans .
you cannot achieve this level of anxiety , hostility and par@@ ano@@ ia anywhere else .
any@@ how , i decided to treat myself to a cigarette holder ,
so then who do i meet , but one of the most ob@@ noxious
trol@@ ler .
no , i didn 't hear about that . the big deal .
he could commit mass murder and he 'd still have a cus@@ hy job waiting for him .
which , i 'll never understand , because she resembles yasser arafat .
you can 't believe everything .
it 's my girlfriend , i 'm just showing her around for the weekend .
fl@@ at-@@ che@@ sted . like two di@@ mes on a hanging board .
what are you in town for ?
who 's that ?
oh yeah ! i can 't stand his fl@@ icks .
they 're looking for volunteers .
i 'm running a little bit late .
good to know .
i 'm only pre-@@ med .
i can 't make lunch .
i have to see his film . you do ?
and then we 're going to discuss it after and everything .
just kiss me so i can really feel it in my toes .
i don 't know , i don 't recall . i think maybe she said you were a 4 .
maybe a 6 , i can 't recall . just this kiss , i want it to be hot .
good work ethic . thank you .
cut .
i have a girlfriend , chan . i don 't think i can do this .
you have a girlfriend who 's your girlfriend ?
she 's from tus@@ con originally .
don 't do this .
your changes are shit . rol@@ lie , sit down .
mr. pol@@ l@@ ard .
thank you for coming , ash@@ le@@ igh , i need to get a little air .
i need to think about . don 't ! no boo@@ ze .
come on .
it 's a process , we do this every time . ted , ted .
oh , god .
he 's not at the hotel and he didn 't show up for the press interview , so
me too . tell him , you ... tell him , tell ro@@ land .
i 'm always at this end of the argument , but you are fresh ,
come on , let 's find him . are you okay ?
and we were supposed to have this ...
parked down with all these interviews for the school paper .
one , it was supposed to be one little ... one tiny little , l@@ ousy , hour inter@@ ve@@ w .
would you just relax ?
because this was going to be a special weekend .
wandering streets , like hag@@ ar in a god@@ damn desert or something .
you want to drink some wine , walk in the rain and give her bronch@@ itis .
she takes her job very seriously , alright ?
i 'm in the process of getting over it .
i 've never really thought about it . i don 't know .
then maybe you better step in and assert yourself .
these are like movie big shots she 's hanging out with .
artists , they are usually passionate .
okay , you 're right , i have to call her now .
you think there 's that much of a rush , i don 't know .
it 's your idea .
there 's nothing you can say . what do you mean ?
christ , chan , you just encouraged me to call her .
we have a number of things planned for today .
but , i really , i can 't explain it over the phone .
what could possible be so secre@@ tive about that ?
unless there 's some funny business going on ?
oh , these , god@@ damn , cell@@ phones are ...
it sounds dubious to you because you have sinister mind .
she 's charming and delightful . she 's pretty .
she sings very nicely . she plays the flute .
but i 'm sick of hearing about her , okay ?
gat@@ s@@ by . yeah .
he goes to yar@@ dley too .
he 's not really focused professionally .
a broadway book@@ ie@@ he 's a little eccentric .
she was always forcing him to read everything , and learn piano ...
he was one of those students who ...
sounds like me .
don 't tell anybody , but i think he has a touch of asper@@ ger 's .
what are you doing now ? why ?
and i thought about going to modern museum .
oh , i see . you have nothing better to do so you want me to keep you company ?
you 've always had a little bit of an attitude , okay ?
i have to check out some paintings at the mat 's profession class .
i don 't know why you couldn 't have just ...
i 'd give you an arizona lunch , but we are all out of beef jer@@ ky .
my folks are in east ham@@ pton for the weekend .
i 've got a date tonight .
you wouldn 't know him , he 's a girlfriend 's der@@ mat@@ ologist .
don 't forget to show him those three irregular black mol@@ es on your back .
i really hope i won 't regret not going to the hamilton 's .
which clock ?
i love it , it 's very old movie .
and she never comes .
can 't they just kiss in the rain ?
picture yourself . okay .
you 're pac@@ ing up and down , rain drops have just started to fall .
expecting your ...
but he just diagnosed a carcinoma in his own lim@@ p .
he meets me , holds me , kisses me .
connie !
is this how you are shopping with jud@@ y in connecticut ?
i happen to see you out the window , from the car .
i 'm 21 . she 's 21 .
i have a proof of age , actually . no , you don 't need this .
really , can i write this down ?
ask him how many times he has been unf@@ ai@@ thful to me ?
stop filling her head with lies . ash@@ le@@ igh , come here .
find rol@@ lie . i don 't know my way around new york .
i know and i loved that . i loved hearing every detail .
i thought you were a special idiot .

ow , i just bit my tongue .
i 'd stop doing that right now .
congratulations .
my teeth don 't know where to go .
listen , perfect teeth ,
we thought you ran away .
i had quite a day .

.... like they happen in the line of duty .
like our father aldo bur@@ rows ..
really wants your attention here .
maybe they 're trying to use ..
he 's traveling with an ex-@@ secret service guy .
so all this is just a distraction
they had to know that we 'd talk to the camer@@ aman .
sara , if you 're listening ,
.... of your commitment to help others
there 's more of the same here .
if you ask me , it doesn 't look like he means this at all .
i don 't see ... play it again .
i did say that@@ .@@ would you say that ?
but it 's too late for that no@@ w.@@ yeah .
people murdered by government operatives ...
what do you mean ? they 're not going after the president ;
but , you know , we wouldn 't mind seeing those numbers
great .
yeah .
and that 's only because people don 't seem to care .
with that said , if you could broker some deal
i mean , we 've been looking for an opening
it 's the global rehabilitation initiative , sir .
yeah , well , we ran it up the flag@@ pole

the airport 's known as the main artery to the outside world .
planes were flying an hour ago . you got a phone ?
burned it up j@@ acking off to queen , though .
c-@@ note 's organizing a passage on the flight as we speak .
you really paid the equivalent of ten million rial
freddie mercury 's ashes .
come on .
i think it 's time we get san@@ e and head to the airport .
this is better . they control the station .
where ?
bring your weapons , i will stay on them .
we checked . there 's enough fuel to get us out of yemen .
we 'll find out .
we can find a way there , hop a train .
doubling down on a bad bet .
more than they were already making :

sweetheart , don 't you even want to talk about this ?
even if he is one in a million ,

you wanna just throw that away ?
this isn 't about magic .
look , you made a commitment . you will honor that commitment .
luke !
let 's settle down
train wreck .
daddy always parks in the back of the school .
because we 're late ?
and because i tipped over .

you spilled it !
daddy always zi@@ ps it for me .
okay . great . well , thank you so much .
and i love the gi@@ ve-@@ and-@@ take , everyone .
hey , dad . how 's f@@ ris@@ co ?
i didn 't even have to spend the night .
gl@@ oria 's snor@@ ing like a water buffalo .

well , for starters , you don 't .
dad , your hot wife
it 's a small sacrifice

mom , what happened ?
oh , well . we cried
well , have you talked to him about it ?
i know . i know phil 's not the brightest cra@@ yon in the box .
that 's what i kind of like about him , you know ?
i know that sounds perverse , but he 's kind of like my dad in that way .
i 'm gonna get straight c 's !
phil is literally the boy next door .
he was so dull and stupid . i made fun of him .
but then , one night that summer ,
oh , my god .
look what the bats dragged in .
oh , shit , he 's coming over here .
guys , be cool . come on .
sorry , i didn 't know anyone was here .
hey .
okay .
he 's a nice boy .
he 's rented a tu@@ x , and everything

i guess life with my father must have been pretty bleak and miserable for her .
what do you mean , different ?
okay . sorry to bother you , mrs. conn@@ ors .
all right .
well ,
one day i hope some mus@@ ky mach@@ o stu@@ d will fuck the shit out of me too .

seriously , just go back to bed .
so ? that 's enough to know that he 's hot , and smart ,
yeah , that was enough .
oh , yeah . i 'd say so . i mean , i definitely feel more comfortable in my own skin .
and i assume you haven 't heard from your mother .
i don 't know . it 's kind of gotten to the point where
kat , this is may . may , kat .
i 've heard so much about you .
dad , i told you i am thr@@ illed that you met someone .
took off your wedding ring
why bother ? i mean , mom left us .
it 's about time we et on with our lives .
wh@@ ac ?
there was a spoon at the bottom of the sink , and
nothing .
oh , yeah ?
hardly ever talk about your mother .
i don 't think i agree with that .
you really want my opinion ?
exhaustive ? you guys barely even looked for her .
not a single trace was ever found .
so where do you think she is ?
what ?
we did a thorough background check on your father .
my dad is a fucking w@@ imp .
not according to bob and mar@@ gie carl@@ sen .
to live next door to them in river@@ side
that 's better . that 's it . come on , give it a wh@@ ack .

you can 't leave .
i didn 't know his last name was bloom .

hey , what about this ? it looks like a receipt .
for a cup of coffee .
from the future ? !
so one of us came back from the future
okay , okay . everything is fine .
lightning shut out of your butt , and now they 're coming for you .
wait ... where are all the mushrooms ?
oh , no , i lost my rings !
no kids allowed in here .

and if i don 't make it , just ditch me ,
i kin@@ da feel like i checked the ' save the life@@ '
i wanna check that box .
all right , everybody . nothing to see here .
that 's why , in the suburbs , there is nothing more decep@@ tive than a smile .
she said dy@@ lan 's not the same girl .
i know it sounds weird , but julie says dy@@ lan does not remember anything about living here .
but if i were your wife ..
oh , honey , people talk ... angry people disappointed people .
no , no , l don 't need magaz@@ in@@ es@@ .i need company .
so ...
so tell me some@@ th@@ ing.@@ when you go to a ribbon cutting ,
you know , l have the cu@@ test sha@@ wl in the car ,
did i ever tell you about my father ?
started in the liver , went into his bones ,
i 'm not finished .
she did have the key ...
oh , hey what 's up ?
sure@@ .@@ what do you need ... flour , sugar ?
57 grand in debt .
f course .
there 's good jobs out there .
fuck off , you fucking bast@@ ard ! get to fuck !
fuck 's sake .
it was on the walls , all over me .
well , listen . just calm down .
my daughter , li@@ za jane , she 's .
my wife 's up the wall with it .
i 'm not finishing till late .
just get a replacement driver , won 't cost you a penny
ive been speaking to the drivers as well
it 's good you 're using your initiative , though it shows planning ahead .
it 's just , erm
i had four drivers in here last week .
second driver , his sister had a stroke .
fourth driver , his daughter tried to commit suicide .
my old man was a farmer . he mil@@ ked cows .
do you wanna know why ' m number one ?
they couldn 't sive a shit if you fall asleep at the wheel
and all of that gets fed back into this box .
this decides who lives and who dies .
patron saint of nasty bast@@ ards .
hello
well , is he there ? can i speak to him ?
ive your head a shake , get through school , get a job , car , holiday
you 've got a family that care about you , that love you .
and we 're done for if you don 't w@@ at h your temper . you 're exhausted
i can 't have that
once that line 's crossed , you can 't go back .
did you not see it . he came at me , it wasn 't the other way round .
it would be harsh . you should prepare yourself .
which means every surgeon in this room
see you in the or .
get out of here
you pretending like nothing happened ?
hunt literally tried to kill you .
that doesn 't mean you have to stand by .
so how is it anymore acceptable that i walk away from this ?
it 's not cut and drive .
clear .
from your lips to god 's ears
oh , yeah ? i 'm not the one who needs help around here .
i 'm not the one who half this hospital is talking about
dr. bail@@ ey . i 'm not assisting you ,
a year from now , you need to be able to do this stuff .
you really think i 'm gonna be here a year from now ?
force@@ ps .
i 'm gonna see your dick
yeah , but it does put people with the one .
but how do you know they 're perfect matches ?
each time you get a little bit more pli@@ able ,
and then you have to live the rest of your life
every crazy thought you 've ever had ,
right . so if it 's everything in your head ..
all right , so now you 're gonna say :
once shortened , the expiry date cannot be extended .
everything happens for a reason .
so what does she want ?
she 's just walking around , asking everybody ,
go sit back down with your horn .
there 's something wrong with it .
eve@@ rett !
i don 't know what you said , f@@ ay .
penny , give me your horn .
so it 's not broken ?
double-@@ dealing devil@@ -@@ dog . that had me so scared .
you can always do that if someone 's a wet ra@@ g .
well , i can 't do that to someone .
it 's stopping someone from embarrassing themselves .
putting up the numbers means
i 'm sorry , you two . i 'm gonna need to see a license for that .
then come up with some other way to fill up this tape recorder .
although , i was enjoying it back there
tell me the cra@@ zi@@ est caller you ever had .
not about a caller , but about
you certainly can ,
i know it isn 't . i don 't care .
what else you got in there ?
you don 't believe me , do you ? you 're just pulling my leg .
i love it . i 'm interviewing you . i 'm playing a part .
do we have time to do those two ?
all right , if you like that , br@@ ace your brain for this .
you tell me all about it .
hold on , ' cause i wanna read it to you the way it was written ,
so , " picture a man in new york city , in times square .
they were tall .
yeah .
maybe there 's a couple of families ,
and i don 't mean that because they 're indians .
that means we 're gonna lose .
no . why ?
ar@@ lo 's working on it though .
all right , i 'm off .
okay , bye .
no , i was watching tv .
like what ?
something that just came in through the board
all right . connect it .
i 've never heard that before .
she said there was something going on out of town
and when did you say my show got cut into ?
but this one ... worried me .
probably ' cause it was so secre@@ tive .
well , we built the ceiling over this thing , carefully .
and when the propell@@ ers had started spinning
the same sound you just played tonight .
oh , i couldn 't forget it .
and then the sound disappeared and we got further away .
and in the next few weeks ,
and i think what@@ ever@@ . that area of the desert

it will be located on a computer disk .
you , solo , are to investigate
ole@@ g . give my regards to nina .
your corrupt and criminal background ...
but what interests me , given your profile ,
what 's he doing here ?

it 's your cover .
the russian minister of culture
and naturally , you 'd introduce him
jack de@@ ven@@ y ,

can 't touch .
why do you think they have radiation tools and suit
we wouldn 't have found that without my father 's watch .
be my guest .
oh , don 't be so hard on yourself .
the fault doesn 't lie in your performance .
she gave you up like an unwanted kit@@ ten .
and how is that ?
the russians and the americans thought they were using me ,
she seemed so innocent .
it 's a tracking device .
i 'm sure my ..
i think i need to make a telephone call .
i 've been here before .
i 'm afraid that isn 't going to stop you getting hurt .
only my mother calls me napoleon .
what history has failed to relate

there 's a short in the wiring
my apologies .
i 'm so sorry i can 't stay to finish you off myself .
and i want it to be slow

because of this boy 's apparent shortcomings ,
but what the other boys didn 't understand about their victim

will you give us a minute ?
i 'll be right here .
we have to get to that island .
you 're the one he 's been having fun with .
but on the other hand , i know exactly what 'll happen .
he 's prepared to sell his ass on this ,
a man with that skill set 's never wanting for employment .
just give me a minute .
damn .
follow me .
they will send an army to stop us .
the ine is secured . you 're now connected , sir .

well , she 's not british . " she "
ga@@ by 's working for you , isn 't she ?
you got there in the end .
a daughter 's touch .
now that is a good idea .
she knew that the ring you gave her was bu@@ gged
and , of course , you are not average ,
you told ga@@ by to drop us in it
well , that is a very poor translation , solo , but ...
thank you very much .
well , it 's known as a cou@@ pler .
t 's left over from when this was a warhead
i 'm sorry .

ocean@@ side pd . how may i direct your call ? u@@ h-@@ huh . right
when i sold him some ice cream .
when you would go out to robin hood woods ,
did you ever see anything out there ?
i ran and jessi@@ e caught me .
he tried to cut me on my side .
then he grabbed my hands and made me cut chris .
jessi@@ e , on wednesday , may 5 , 1993 , early in the morning ,
then i went with them up to the ... up to the robin hood .
this is paul ford from ton@@ es@@ boro .
and val price is the public defender who 's been appointed
does that surprise you ?
got any experts lined up ?
he was once diagnosed as mentally retar@@ ded .
in my experience , most of them are .
because if you don 't have a strong case ,
and i worry about that baby .
because of the rumor that they 're going to sacrifice it to satan .
you 're working for them ? what are you , like a lawyer 's assistant ?
but you won 't be representing me in court .
so i 'm just supposed to trust you ? tell you everything
they will do anything to get people to say what they want to hear .
why did those girls say people were wit@@ ches back in salem ?
i did that with a knife . that 's my girlfriend 's name .
why ?
through drinking the blood of others .
i 've been doing it since i was , i@@ ke , 10 je@@ ars old .
and everybody knows they .... i heard from a bunch of people
you don 't dress like that when you ... when you , um ....
did he like sco@@ uting ?
i saw you on tv .
you 're supposed to be in mourning .
what 's that supposed to mean ?
acting like a god@@ damn silly fool .
is that what you 've been doing ?
what the hell are you talking about ?
you shut up !
go ahead . hit me . hit me . i dare you , hit me .
i need to talk to you about something , in person .
it 's really important . okay . good night .
jessi@@ e started running and caught steve .
then , um , they took them ,
and nobody knows what happened but me .
may i have a tea , please ?
it 's good to hear from you ,
then they came by my office ,
i was so insul@@ ted , i was so angry ,
ta 's fine
it 's just that with all the paperwork in the case ,
the police seem so certain . are you sure you want to do this ?
it 's just that sometimes you take these things so personally .
you know , if the police are so god@@ dam@@ ned certain about their case
ron , please don 't .
all the way down to ten mile ba@@ you .
we ought to just fry him and get it over with .
craw@@ led on my hands and knees and felt along with my hands
uh , yes , sir . i played this .
and after hearing the tape , what was the defendant 's reaction ?
then he said that he was present when the boys were murdered .
the ver@@ dic@@ ts read as follows .
" and of second degree murder in the deaths of christopher b@@ yers
do you think it was a just and a proper sentence ?
it 's one down , two to go .
and they prayed to their devil and they prayed to their satan ,
there 's a war going on .
yeah . he did do something strange . very strange .
so when were you planning on telling us about it ?
but you 've known about it for months . how could you not tell us about it ?
there was blood on the knife .
you feature prominently in the prosecution 's case .
no . no , i can 't talk about it .
detective donald bra@@ y ?
michael moore and chris b@@ yers are his two best friends .
i 'd say it 's very possible . right , honey ? it is possible .
he told us about the meetings in the woods .
you knew about the cult ?
questioned vic@@ ki .
she said no .
jessi@@ e !
it 's all right .
but did you ever find any evidence to corrobor@@ ate
no physical evidence . but we got something e se .
so vic@@ ki 's plan failed , right ?
yeah , but vic@@ ki 's plan got jessi@@ e involved ,
and jason bal@@ d@@ win gets caught in the net just by picking the wrong friend .
are they gonna put aaron on the stand ?
oh , but they did hear from him .
" nobody knows what happened but me . "
look at this .
this police report was signed by detective ridge
this is a god@@ damn witch hunt .
and once they set their sights on jason and dam@@ ien ,
whatever it takes .
nobody will . nobody but you .
washing away your sins . calling on the name of the lord .
nd how were you accepted into enrollment at columbia pacific university ?
did you have to fill out a little fl@@ yer like this ?
did you know this was a correspondence school ? i didn 't .
we object to dr. gri@@ ff@@ is as an expert .
what do you want me to do ? do you want me to lie to you ?
and all the other bull@@ shit .
chris !
your honor , may we approach ?
my understanding was that this young man re@@ tracted his statement .
why would his testimony be relevant ?
i 'm not gonna allow you to drag in every possible suspect
your honor , they could just talk to anybody on the street and they could say ,
this was the ocean@@ side pd
i 'm gonna ask you .... .
... to go back to the jury room .
bobby de@@ angelo asked for a picture of my son and
yes , you do , mrs. hob@@ bs . we all do .
yes .
we are going to be all right . justice is gonna be se@@ wed , and we love you ,
yeah , after 17 hours i believe anybody would .
and immediately after that , did you again deny any knowledge
it was so important to get that kid on the stand
but the judge says that 's not relevant
you can 't see p@@ ant of the tape
we have a syn@@ opsis from the ocean@@ side f@@ d .
since when do we depend on police reports ?
but you should have told bur@@ nett .

that was already done when i got it .
okay .
i@@ was told il@@ o@@ ok good in it .
tm familiar with it .
based on his writings , he believes in human sacrifice , doesn 't he ?
his writings indicated that children were the best type of human sacrifice .
yes , sir .
now , all this sat@@ an@@ ic stuff ? it doesn 't matter whether i believe it .
it doesn 't even matter whether you believe in it .
now , you look at history ,
and when you look at it all together ,
the first verdict reads as follows .
expect typical comm@@ s problems .
if we miss two windows ,
way@@ point one is bud@@ we@@ iser .
how is that gonna help me ?

thanks for the offer , but i 'm not really a writer .
plus , i 'm trying to put my story behind me .
it pays $ 50 . here 's my card .

that occur around the globe each year .
the earth shook for five straight minutes .
and that 's not the biggest earthquake ever recorded .
b@@ am .
.. that level@@ ed h@@ ilo , hawaii 8@@ 000 miles away .
so , um ..
it 's the demarcation line between two tectonic plates that are constantly moving
.. i 'd say it 's not a matter of if .
how soon before you get her fixed ?
el@@ gin , you move any faster , you 're gonna break that hip .
yeah . leaving tomorrow . driving her back up to school .
i figure we cruise up the coast . do a little camping .
now , we got a rare low-level seismic swarm out in fal@@ co , nevada .
where the hell is tal@@ co , nevada ?
all right .
any known faults . now , if we get there while the mini qu@@ akes continue
then we 're predicting them . then we are predicting them .
let 's go check it out .
i was wondering if there was room for my bike .
that 's a great idea . i 'm sure i could figure out a way to fit it in .
lake ha@@ vas@@ u city , needles , bl@@ y@@ the and laugh@@ lin also suffered major damage .
is expected to begin arriving in the next 24 hours .
i know . i 'm so sorry . we 're heading out tomorrow .

i just wasn 't ready to hear about you and bl@@ ake moving in with someone else .

i think it 's gonna be hard for her to ..
oh , my god . we 're having an earthquake .
lawrence , the rich@@ ter just jumped from a 6.5 to an 8.5 .
powers of ten !
don 't worry . cal@@ tech is probably the saf@@ est place to be right now .

in the central valley .
more importantly , people need to know that the shaking is not over .
san francisco will get hit again .
our models are predicting a 9.5 or greater .
you will feel it on the east coast .
and , if you can 't , you need to find any means possible ...
ii doesn 't matter .
what 's the point ?
and then coming home every day to you and bl@@ ake only made it harder .
it was perfect .
i just didn 't know how .
i really am .
then nobody could have
let 's go ! keep it moving ! let 's go !
do you mind if i ask why you wear two of the same nec@@ k@@ lac@@ es ?
i started wearing it after she died .
i 'm so sorry . i didn 't mean ... no . it 's okay
what are you doing ?
ts this it
here we go .
we can listen in , we can see what 's going on .
the coast guard is asking anyone with access to a boat to please volunteer .

let them be cute , for crying out loud .
she 's breathing funny .
no ! no ! no !
no , i 'm not ! i promised cle@@ m i 'd stay with her !
you 're too big for this .
i 'm a little embarrassed for you .
what 's cle@@ m gonna think if she wa@@ kes up and i 'm gone ?
uh .. look , uh ...
i 'll tell her whatever you want .
promise ?
you 're gonna need a pen and a pad of paper .
pathology 's back .
no pathology seen .
there 's a chance the other one 's clean , too .
nd pledge myself to thee forever .
for making me feel so at home .
so , thank you for being so welcoming and wonderful .
he 'd carry it on his shoulder like this .
i 'm being serious ! this is a beautiful event ..
we were in the same foster home together for a year .
so , here 's to happily ever after .
m@@ mm .
sam .
this was the most perfect day .
how did we get home last night ?
stop . not right now .
this is where you 'll go to school .
you 're gonna be a much cooler kid .
very pretty church .
here 's the anderson house . it still looks like shit .
ma@@ ver@@ ick , god damn .
come here . hey , no , no .
i know , i don 't want that .
it 'm just gonna eat a bunch of cookies .
i 'm just hungry .
i 'll be right there . wh@@ oa . wh@@ oa ! wh@@ oa !
mother@@ fuc@@ ker !
get away from my car !
it 's okay . it 's okay .
so , i figured i 'd just get a couple of classes going ...
you don 't want to just wait until the fall ?
okay , i was just thinking because ..
no , i know . but the baby is coming in march .
we 're not putting everything on hold indefinitely .
but if i stop doing it now ...
i 'm gonna be stuck in this house
i 'm gonna be nat@@ alie , and i don 't want to be her .
that 's what it 's turning into . i know that ..
okay .
i don 't know . the guy in the cab ?
he was like our cab driver , on our honeymoon .
look at this .
wh@@ oa , what the fuck ?
it 's gone .
ti was literally just looking at this shit right before you
fuck !
because everything i 've seen says they 're , uh , religious symbols .
and then there 's that .
these are the only ones i 've actually seen in person .
first john , 2 : 18 .
these are from early , early religion . these are
these families are suffering from starvation due to overcrowding .
when will the bloodshed come to an end ?
i came so you could explain to me in person why , in the middle of a war ...
i 'm sure you can understand why we haven 't been able to leave .
you were ordered to shut down .
you were army intelligence before you joined us ..
you don 't want to go back .
it 's the in@@ activity that suc@@ ks .
well , it 's something .
makes sense to me . what else are we good for ?
why don 't you put that in your letter ? hm ?
okay . you ready to do this ?
we don 't want your fascist war ! we don 't need your draft no more !
we don 't we need your draft no more !
we don 't we want your fascist war !
come on .
sign this and you won 't have to worry about your kids getting blown up .
ram@@ on , you okay ?
and a truck that only you have the keys to . what ?
inside job ? i don 't know shit about this .
dave .
only then will he destroy x@@ an@@ dar for me .
it will be my honor .
if this happens again , you 'll be facing our father
just like you .
all of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid ,
can you believe they call us criminals ,
and told me to tell you ,
it 's my policy never to discuss my clients , or their needs .
an occupational hazard , i 'm sure , in your line of work .
ron@@ an ? i 'm sorry , mr. qu@@ ill .
but i want no part of this transaction if ron@@ an is involved .
a k@@ ree fan@@ atic , outra@@ ged by the peace treaty ,
farewell , mr. qu@@ ill .
what happened ?
if there 's one thing i hate , it 's a man without integrity .
you have the bearing of a man of honor .
people say it about me , all the time ,
you gotta be kidding me .
i live for the simple things .
i 'm sorry .
what a bunch of a-@@ holes .
i guess most of nova corps wanna uphold the laws ,
i 've had a lot of folks try to kill me over the years .
hold
ain 't no thing like me , except me .
it 's like i said
she 'll last a day , tops .
the guards will protect her , right ?
they don 't care what we do to each other inside .
check out the new meat .
he killed my family .
of course , dra@@ x . here , i .
i 'm no family to ron@@ an or than@@ os .
woman , your words mean nothing to me !
cra@@ p .
are you not the man this wen@@ ch attempted to kill ?
look , this is from a smo@@ king-@@ hot raj@@ ak girl .
this is a symbol for you slic@@ ing his throat .
would cut his head clean off
you have been betrayed , ron@@ an .
gam@@ ora may yet recover the or@@ b .
you are the one here with nothing to show for it .
lower your tone !
i only ask that you take this matter seriously .
your politics bore me .
i shall honor our agreement , k@@ ree ,
thanks , dad . sounds fair .
let 's head to the k@@ yl@@ n .
and to do that , i 'm gonna need a few things .
tt was one time , man .
spare me your foul gaze , woman .
we promised him he could stay by your side until he kills your boss .
i was just kidding about the leg .
what ?
was it funny ?
i had to transfer him 30,000 units !
well , he 's got a plan .
i have a plan ! i have a plan !
hey !
that 's for if things get really hard@@ core .
no one 's blowing up moons .
so , listen , i 'm gonna need your buyer 's coordinates .
if we 're gonna work together , you might try trusting me a little bit .
i 'd trust you a lot more if you told me what this was .
i don 't know what it is .
i am not a princess !
nobody is killing anybody on my ship !
i have no interest in money .
that means more money for the three of us .
she has no idea .
i swear . i don 't know where they went ! i swear .
yeah
the nova can 't know what we 're after .
do you got any other cute little bu@@ ggers like this one ?
i can 't tell if you 're jo@@ king or not .
but first , you gonna tell me what this or@@ b is ,
sir , the high-end community is a .
it 's a tigh@@ t-@@ knit .
the high-end community is a very tigh@@ t-@@ knit
car@@ ina
we do , master .
i don 't have to remind you
heads up ! we 're in@@ bound .
there are no regulations whatsoever here .
bone , brain tissue , spinal fluid .
it 's dangerous and illegal work , suitable only for out@@ laws .
billy the kid ,
yeah , you should .
can you spare any units ?
we are to wait here for his representative .
this is no respectable establishment .
now , let 's put more of this liquid into our bodies .
man , you wouldn 't believe what they charge for fuel out here .
my connection is making us wait .
where yours is more ,
when he said he was going to destroy an entire planet for ron@@ an ,
my mom liked sharing with me all the pop songs that she loved growing up .
the day that she
do ? nothing . you listen to it . or you can dance .
really ?
her body mo@@ ds should keep her alive a couple more minutes ,
in a second , we 're gonna be in the same boat .
i saw you out there .
but i couldn 't let you die .
i mean , not to bra@@ g
wh@@ ac
qu@@ ill just got himself captured .
you 're right .
the lun@@ atic on top of this craft is holding a had@@ ron enfor@@ cer .
what the hell ?
a very big new one !
rocket , it 's me , for god sa@@ kes !
hey , qu@@ ill . what 's going on ?
we 're gonna rob the guys who just beat us sen@@ seless .
how about trying to save us by blowing us up ?
and how on earth were they gonna turn us over
i have part of a plan !
you don 't get to ask questions
we 've already established
like three seconds ago !
she 's right . you don 't get an opinion .
i don 't know . twelve percent .
that 's a fake laugh .
it 's barely a concept .
i am gro@@ ot .
thank you , gro@@ ot . thank you .
guys .
yon@@ du is gonna be here in two seconds .
i need your help .
you know what i see ?
i , for one , am not gonna stand by and watch
you 're asking us to die .
qu@@ ill .
i will be grateful to die among my friends .
i will fight beside you .
i am gro@@ ot .
now i 'm standing . y '@@ all happy ?
the bigger the target , the bigger the power surge .
all plants , animals ,
so ron@@ an does not make the surface .
then , our craft and yon@@ du 's will enter .
i think of sa@@ ka@@ ar@@ an as paper people .
which i can disable by dismantling the power source .
we 'll never make it up there !
for the record , i advised against trusting you here .
den@@ arian sa@@ al , should we break formation
we 'll take care of the people down here .
star@@ -@@ ord
you@@ ir friends have arrived .
if you will follow den@@ arian de@@ y ,
your wife and child shall rest well knowing that you have aven@@ ged them .
time ? 2@@ pm .
i 'm sorry . i 'm disturbing you .
um , well , bea@@ vers eat tree bark .
so , i 'll say cin@@ nam@@ on .
obviously , the answer is cheese danish .
in a world ruled by a giant bea@@ ver ,
thousands die .
this is ridiculous .
is he always like this when he loses ?
you should 've been here for the great giant tan@@ tr@@ um of 2008 .
perhaps it would be kin@@ der to play a game more suited to his abilities .
i 'm going to my room .
but next time , don 't tell us where you 're hiding .
that 's a little vul@@ gar for the dinner table , don 't you think ?
po@@ tty " is innocent . " po@@ tty " is ador@@ able .
if i don 't have to bo@@ om@@ -@@ boom .
you all remember amy far@@ rah fow@@ ler .
i got it . but what i was going for was , you know , how 's your life ?
subject to entropy , decay and eventual death .
why is she not taking our order ?
it 's how they lure you in .
so , this is nice .
my relationship with amy was purely intellectual ,
okay . good .
i gotta tell you guys ,
no , i mean since the sha@@ my hit a reef .
you should go ' cause you want to go ,
can i want to go
yeah , but now , wait .
or whatever i have to want ?
all right .
you know , i haven 't seen ra@@ i in several days .
and if so , should we be interviewing for a replacement ?
he 's just decided he 's never leaving his apartment again .
he 's upset because he can 't get anywhere with women .
it 's just ..
really ?
a little ? try 45 minutes .
so ... you know how it 's called a hot stone massage ?
i know !
but at this point , i 'm like ,
so ... what 's on the agenda here ?
mm . right , right . so who 's doing what for that ?
it 's so nervous every time i walk into this class .
between you and me ,
i mean , like this morning ,
well , here 's an idea . don 't go in that room .
you know what ? we 're both stressed .
no , thanks . i 've been hitting that stuff
well , after the day i had ,
" you should be sad and miserable and on time ,
they 're jealous .
it 's nothing fancy , but , uh , i 'm proud to say
this is exactly what i 'm looking for .
you know , embezzlement , adultery .
i suppose i could ask you the same thing .
i 've just been feeling dis@@ connected lately .
if i may .
we don 't have time for that .
yes , because we all know
would you be offended
oh , dear . i guess il 'll have to keep it simple .
holy cra@@ p !
coincidence or not ? you decide .
you said you wouldn 't judge .
it 's full of guys who photo@@ shop hair on their heads
a bar ? oh , i don 't know .
well , i 'm afraid you 're gonna have to leave .
is that a good thing ?
" hom@@ ey but refined ,
which is also a good thing .
hold on .
let me get you a ref@@ ill .
it just really helps
then ..
yeah .
learn it and throw it away .
oh , my god .
isn 't this the day we were ..
reverend sy@@ kes . what a nice surprise !
i practically had to fight my way in .
thank you so much for suggesting i get involved .
the intention of charity
feeling important 's just a bonus .
i was hoping you could tell me
no , b@@ ree .
why ? i was just trying to make this place special .
hey , we 're still eating .
you certainly look like you can afford to .
we made this place a success . "
this food isn 't for you .
so please , pack up your laptops
ben , i 'm sorry . i have made a terrible mess of things .
you think you can make a speech that good again tomorrow ?
norman rock@@ well would walk down this street
by the way , i , uh , checked my e-mail ,
oh , my god , you are so out of touch .
you don 't understand the kinds of things real people deal with .
fine . i don 't need your help .
this event is going off without a hit@@ ch .
hello ?
wh@@ oa . what 's going on ?
five . five kids .
i actually have a husband , too , but we 're separated ,
now what do we do ?
but my ex got all my cds .
okay , before you say " no ... "
how@@ dy , folks .
i 'm the sheriff of do@@ dge .... ball .
have you seen the shape some of these folks are in ?
look , this is the " dolphin den . "
anything 's got to be better than this .
we 're really not supposed to , but you know what ?
let me just do this on the board ,
yes !
thank you ! thank you so much !
well , i hope you 're happy .
if i pull that off , will you die ?
you 're a big guy .
was getting caught part of your plan ?
dr. pa@@ vel refused our offer in favor of yours .
sir ?
cr@@ ashing this plane .
this city has seen a historic turnaround
now people are talking about repe@@ aling the dent act .
i 'm told mr. wayne couldn 't be here tonight . i 'm sure he 's with us in spirit .
no one has . not in years .
a thu@@ g who showed his true nature
dent . i 'll let him tell you himself .
the truth ?
the east drawing room .
i 'm sorry , miss tate . i tried , but he won 't see you .
look , you wouldn 't beat up a woman any more than i would beat up a cri@@ pple .
can i have a ride ?
let 's go .
she 's very persistent .
and this is your idea of , uh , sounding the alarm , is it ?
she ?
i wasn 't .
sir . congressman gil@@ ly 's wife has been calling in .
that 's a job for the police ?
pretty soon we 'll be chasing down , uh , overdue library books .
what 's your name , son ?
you have something you want to ask me ?
the last confirmed sigh@@ ting of the batman .
breaks dent 's neck and then just van@@ ishes ?
don 't you want to know who he was ?
master wayne ?
trying to find out more about our je@@ wel thief . i ran her prints .
she may be , but we have a trace on the necklace .
with police data on high-end b-@@ and-@@ e 's , and , um ..
the databases are full of clo@@ se-@@ calls , tips from fences .
we should send the police before she fences the pearls
if it brought you back to the world .
and that 's the problem .
you never went to find a life . to find someone .
i know , and you lost them .
but you 're not living , you 're just waiting , hoping for things to go bad again .
before all this , before batman ?
seven years i waited , hoping that you wouldn 't come back .
maybe a couple of kids .
but we 'd both know that you 'd made it .
i never wanted you to come back to go@@ tham .
and i wanted something more for you than that .
more when it gets col@@ der .
we pulled him from the basin , but other than that we didn 't touch him .
name 's jimmy .
no ? why ?
he aged out . we don 't have the resources to keep boys on after 16 .
not for the past couple of years .
you know what he was doing in the tunnels ?
say you can live down there .
more than you can find up here , i guess .
of course .
t don 't know
no , he 's alone
he 's dead .
the water runs to any one of the outflows . we 'd never find him .
to be funded by the wayne foundation ?
might be time to get some fresh air . start paying attention to the details .
him and his men were behind a coup in west africa .
or so it seems .
yeah .
the foundation is funded by the profits of wayne enterprises .
no , no , no . do we still have any cars around the place ?
i need an appointment at the hospital for my leg .
whichever one jim gordon 's in .
no . that 's because there is no carti@@ lage in your knee .
between that and the scar tissue on your kid@@ neys .
bruce wayne at a charity ball .
even before you became a re@@ cl@@ use , you never came to these things .
it 's about feeding the ego of whichever society ha@@ g laid this on .
because i paid for the big fat spread myself .
you have to invest if you want to restore balance to the world
you have a practiced apa@@ thy , mr. wayne .
and isn 't so wounded when it fails
thank you .
why didn 't you call the police ?
that 's a braz@@ en costume for a cat burgl@@ ar .
bruce wayne , eccentric billion@@ aire .
his wife 's in ib@@ iza .
i 'm adaptable .
but i still can 't let you keep them .
not likely .
your wife said you were taking a cab home .
just you , sir ?
takes a little time to get back in the swing of things .
you haven 't lost your sense of humor .
well , if you 're unwilling to turn on the machine ..
your majority keeps dag@@ ge@@ tt at bay
she 's smart . and quite lovely
n@@ ope . why ?
i retired .
i figured you 'd have shut this place down .
all this new stuff
why ?
oh , now you 're just showing off .
what 's it called ?
i just took to calling it the bat .
works fine , except for the autop@@ il@@ ot
well , i was trying to be modest .
is it really painful ? you 're very welcome to try it , alfred .
if you 're seriously considering going back out there ..
i 'm all ears .
a pit where men are thrown to suffer and die
put that thing away before you hurt yourself . get in !
call everyone in . every car patrol , beat cop , off-@@ duty too .
i 'm gonna take down the batman .
hard to believe , but the suspects are now being pursued ..
well , what do you know ?
please ! just let me go ! please !
negative . stay on the batman .
some robber , or the son of a bitch who killed harvey dent ?
.@@ central heights and east park side areas .
he 's drawing the cops off bane .
we told him it was urgent .
speak of the devil .
what the hell is going on ?
oh , really ?
your hit on the stock exchange , it didn 't work , my friend .
how exactly is that supposed to help my company absorb wayne 's ?
yeah , it 's not much . but it 's more than you 've got right now .
the rich don 't even go broke the same as the rest of us , huh ?
and how would he do that ?
i am the league of shadows .
you fight like a younger man .
get me commissioner gordon . i got a line on the congressman 's kidnapping
oh . do you mind ?
don 't tell me . still in love ?
every man who has rot@@ ted here over the centuries ..
so easy .
and like ship@@ wrecked men turning to seawater from un@@ controllable thirst
.i will feed its people hope to poison their souls .
pull the core out of the reactor .
this is the only power source capable of sustaining it .
five , by my calculations .
and for the sake of your children , dr. pa@@ vel
that was you in front of the stock exchange , wasn 't it ?
and who is capable of disarming such a device ?
only you .
now , this bomb is armed !
such a moment of crisis
we take go@@ tham from the corrupt !
" the cp@@ ph@@ essors of 9@@ emer@@ ai@@ tions
.. the people
h@@ one shall interfere . do as you please .
open it !
... for an army will be raised .
and cast ou@@ tin@@ to che cold wo@@ id hat we know and endure
bane was the child you spoke of ?
the legend is that there was a mercenary who worked for a local war@@ lord .
they were married in secret .
but then he exiled him instead
deco@@ y .
doesn 't matter what i think .
the routes don 't vary much .
dial it back , officer . this situation is unprecedented .
captain , the situation is more complicated than you think .
found the people who run the corporation .
wayne enterprises . you good ?
miss tate 's fully aware of the situation .
why ?
you built the bomb ?
go , go , go !
there were people living upstairs .
has anyone made it ?
the bomb goes off tomorrow .
start to figure out how to bring it down .
fol@@ ey .
you shouldn 't be out on the streets .
everyone else get on the bus , okay ?
the bomb is gonna go off . get out by the south street tunnel or over the bridge .
go , go , go !
you 'll just have to imagine the fire .
pull up .
we have to force that convoy east to the entrance to the reactor .
you have to get that bomb here . you 've got 10 minutes .
they 're gonna try to re@@ connect the core .
beth wilson , chicago gazette .
it was unfortunate .
okay .
this is exactly what i need .
we were just inches away today , inches .
put them in my office on the walls .
somewhere in there is information regarding a ren@@ de@@ z@@ v@@ ous that sco@@ field set up .
lang ! today 's the day franklin told his wife
are you ready ?
you want to get caught ?
i saw you checking out those girls
who is this ?
if you 've done anything to p@@ am ..
we both know your family 's fine .
i 'd think maybe i should move that body .
so even when the body was gone ,
the pressure ...
it 's more than a man can bear .
let me and my family disappear .
how does that sound ?
i know it 's not how you wanted this to play out .
we went to get these , for you .
it is not funny .
now enough of that ! what about the books ? does he not find them ?
he sa@@ is it 'll turn darkness into light . wait until you see it !
you 're fast .
so ..
you have climbed a tree before , haven 't you ?
come on so !
i thought you knew how to climb trees .
yeah. like bushes .
look !
it will be as i say .
well , bren@@ dan . it 's about time we saw you today .
i 'm listening . where were you ?
i went into the forest .
just . it was for brother ai@@ dan ..
yet you dis@@ obey me .
bren@@ dan . you are never to leave the abbey again without my permission .
do you understand ?
good .
there 's no one else here now .
afraid ?
keep going ! finish what you start .
not bad .
do what ?
i haven 't been completely honest with you .
my eyes have become too old . and my hands un@@ steady .
you should be the one to do that page !
there must be somebody else ...
if he is ever to light up the chi@@ -@@ ro page ..
bren@@ dan !
i think you 're ready to learn colum@@ b k@@ il 's secret .
of course , you need another eye .
we 're only here for a short while ...
i won 't be long .
bren@@ dan
i don 't know .
and my door is bol@@ ted from the outside .
i think there 's one in the dark one 's cave .
no bren@@ dan , it 's tric@@ king you . you should have stayed in your tower .
it takes everything . you will die !
the book ..
a@@ isl@@ ing ! this place is hurting you , you must go back .
uh .. okay .
no , no , no . it 's just .. outpatient surgery .
oh , you 'll be cutting .
y@@ ay ?
so one lucky surgeon will find herself
barring any complications ,
i 'm going home later today , honey .
we 'll be prep@@ ping you for surgery soon .
well , i wasn 't planning on staying here overnight .
okay . see you soon .
i know you prefer it .

um , well , maybe i can help since i 'm here .
dr. edwards , i 've got u.@@ n.@@ o.@@ s .
oh , my god . it could be sam@@ anth@@ a 's heart .
this is dr. edwards .
remember ?
yes , i 've got the chart right here .
and they 're both gonna be regular kids .
'@@ cause i can 't imagine going through any of this without you .
how is that for not letting my emotions get away from me ?
i never said my world was perfect .
look , not all of us go to ivy league schools
i know that .
you 're in no position to judge .
and my 1-@@ year-old birthday cake
also , in one of the rooms
it 's true .
four .
but please , he 's the help .
obviously , the next 24 hours will be critical , but so far ,
we 've been waiting for a heart for months .
i sit here and play sol@@ it@@ aire
that was her heart .
i want to be happy for you .
i just can 't .
i 'm so tired right now , i 'm sleep@@ walking .
okay .
it would be for me . that 's for sure .
they 're gonna take really good care of you .
okay , we 're done .
ross is the only one
thank you .
o@@ oh . too late . i 'm done .
pull it out . pull it out .
and you 're gonna like it .
but you get the nasty sm@@ elling green one in bed two .
i will have your wife raped until she is dead .
and then i will have your child
oh , for fuck 's sake .
maybe he st@@ ashed the diamonds there .
it 's the call you 've been waiting for , senator .
she shot my foot in two .
ebola outbreak .
hey , there , i really need to get to a hos ...
you know , wrong place , wrong time , that kind of thing
you need to get out .
shut up .
don 't you worry .
he 's got a lovely fish dinner for you .
i 'm sure he told you about it .
there should also be a package for me
where do you think you got the money for it , huh ?
that was you two ?
look , just take what 's in there and bring the package to ..
he is my husband , not yours .
god@@ damn it .
come on .
nice talking to you , b@@ ye@@ -@@ bye .
tell ms. pin@@ der to get her ass in gear and join us .
you need to get the hell ... stupid .
what went wrong ?
i suppose i should thank you for coming back for us .
you just saved my life .
ironic , considering all the times i 've wished you dead .
no , he didn 't .
you know , take it instead of earn it
what 's on the drive ?
they 've tracked the drive , now they know where it is .
i didn 't miss you .
well , of course you do .
i aim to please .
oh , now you want a relationship , huh ?
give me back my diamonds .
you know , strictly speaking , they belong to a senator .
but how can i get them to you if , uh , i
it 's rectangular , way out of date , and it stin@@ ks .
not at all
say hello to the nice man .
excuse me ?
i 'll trade you this piece of shit for my diamonds .
so i will give you your diamonds as you 're
right this way .
ready , tes@@ si@@ ca ?
hey , penny , it 's me .
i have right here in my hand what it is you want .
isn 't it time we were properly introduced ?
is this face to face enough for you ?

i fed some gum to a dinosaur .
yeah . sure you did , buddy .
i wasn 't jo@@ king yesterday . i was serious .
and i think you should , too .
to live in this extraordinary place
i told you you 'd think it was crazy .
everything is .
i don 't think it 's crazy .
for now .
it 's done . we 're done . it 's over .
apart from the fact that the welcome decorations are down ,
the party 's still a day away .
he 's actually a journalist , and he wants to write

i know .
i 'm pregnant .
in exactly the same place that she was .
and i have you and my three d@@ ads ,
she must have been so scared .
as is this tar@@ tar stain . it just refuses to come out .
well , manager , i need to get out of there
me , me , me , me , me ,
you don 't even have to pretend it 's about anyone else .
pretty much every single day still .
the good news is the rash is not spreading past my nuts .
did it have anything to do with the rash ?
it 's not a traditional polish wedding
take it down a no@@ tch .
oh , hi , i 'm not here to buy , just to look .
since 1998 .
can i just smell a piece ?
it 'll get you going , and then halfway to paris ,
oh , paris reminds me .
i once hid in the luggage cart for 12 hours
me , every third tuesday .
i am watching the doors !
yeah , real funny , sir .
je@@ ez ! how could a dress be this big ?
i have to get something out of my bag .
i can 't find it . here , take this .
a hundred dollars in change .
it 's a polish custom to throw change at the bride .
is this a wedding or a cock fight ?
what do you have to get out of your bag ?
what is it ?
back off !
i 'm at the business bottom
y@@ up . that 's what would happen next .
people are placing bets that i 'm halfway to reno
they came sm@@ elling like that din@@ er cheese
we look just like sophie ! i am so relieved .
ole@@ g , stop looking at us like that .
you guys look like the four tops .
ole@@ g , sophie doesn 't want you to see her .
and chest@@ nut , i 'm sorry , baby .
and , han , you 're supposed to take this
what do you think , girls ?
oh , listen ! i heard the tu@@ ba . that 's my cue !
her dress almost killed us

we feel the same way .
it 's got to be a mistake .
mom !
i can 't wear red with these shoes ! u@@ gh !
yes , carlos sol@@ is loved his wife .... .
oh , that 's okay , swee@@ tie .
you can have one of these by working very hard ...

but why buy ... . that one ?
escrow 's closed , beth .
how did i not know this ?
the girls are meeting for poker . i 'll be back in a few .
no . i 'm really just doing a dri@@ ve-@@ by .
why don 't you just leave her with me ?
but we usually play for a couple of hours .
you seem to be boun@@ cing back just fine .
when your friend called ,
is this friend named rene@@ e ?
i wish i had a friend like that .
what we need is for you to let us be who we are .
goodbye , ga@@ by .
you said i had a month .
it 's the internet . everything moves very fast .
they talked about a big ad campaign ,
get them to stop it , or at least put some other girl up there .
and they 'll agree not to put them up ,
i talked them down from $ 12,000 .
i mean , it puts us right back where we were
and what 's mike gonna say when he notices
maybe i should just let them put up the bill@@ boards .
you know , there is another way .
how dare you exploit a traumatic childhood memory .
oh , look . he followed you home .
about the same as when he finds out
why don 't we ask him who he wants to be with ?
put him on the spot like that .
is that a hot flash or you just losing your nerve ?
everything okay here ?
can we ask you something ?
forest green or brown
we usually just take nancy around
pardon me , may i get past ?
i don 't know what to do .
you know , my cat can 't get this open either .
rich , funny , and in a suit at 9 : 00 a.m. ?
you know , my cat , dic@@ kens , loves your cat .
dic@@ kens , after the author , max .
the guy who wrote m@@ up@@ pets christmas carol .
so i let her in . i hope that 's okay .
i hope your girlfriend didn 't mind .
and i better get going .
max , give the man his case .
she doesn 't want to get out of cus@@ hy this thing .
well , here 's my card , just give me a call
a card , a meeting , a suit , a joke ?
well , thank you , owen charles boy@@ d ,
she 's jo@@ king , she 's just not as funny as you .
okay .

that 's the kind of fat cat
hey , girls .
i knew she 'd come back pregnant .
well , her fur is thick@@ er , she 's got a little spar@@ kle in her eye ,
come on , we all know what you did .
you do know what you 're doing , right , sophie ?
come on , girls , i need some hot water and fresh to@@ wels .

they used to be our bright future .
oh , my god , that must be the sound of a sur@@ rendering cat uter@@ us .
i don 't know why i 'm not throwing up .
well , i 'm off korean dum@@ plings for life .
said it was an accident .

it 's going really well though .
i have to start paving attention to details .
what ? i don 't care .
max , please , let me handle this .
we 're getting close , look , i 'm holding his shoe .
survivor 's guilt ?
it 's not about my platoon .
i 'm asking you to claim them .
it 's about the fact that i tried
how will you know if you can 't name those feelings ?
i don 't know .
just to try on ?
the chem@@ o 's gonna take a lot out of you .
hi , yes . i wanted to discuss , flower arrangements .
know , honey@@ . all righ@@ t. sit up
slow , slow . okay
uh , not so fast , dr grey
that mr. gates will also need a nerve repair .
before .
because you 'll have to explore the wound for bone fragments ,
maybe because he was hit by a car .
if he leaves and hurts himself , it 's on you .
but if someone in that waiting room dies , that 's on you .
what
i couldn 't be happier for the both of you .
dresses
so go , try on dresses
i don 't . how does he even know were engaged ?
he isn 't the one that ordered the dress .

the doctor said if we can find a way to get her there
hey , baby . guess what ?
you 're gonna love it there .
and the water .

all i need is plane fare . then we 'll be on our way .
i 'm okay .
i had to get the scru@@ bs with the elastic wai@@ st@@ band .
i won 't . and you can 't make me
the chief will be my best man .
i may be irresponsible and un@@ trustworthy out there
which is what you should 've done when i asked you to stay away from l@@ exi@@ e
oh , hell
you chosen your specialty yet ?
it 's trauma
now i recognize that , uh , my daughter 's a senior resident
uh , i appreciate the offer , sir ,
you don 't have children , do you ?
no , you don 't , no .
i knew i wasn 't no good for her
it 's un@@ forgi@@ vable .
i feel shameful about that .
how is that a start ?
you have to know what it is
he really damaged his facial nerves ,
but he 'll be fine .
oh , my god . thank you . thank you both so much .
i think the important thing is that , you know ,
we had a fight and you stor@@ med out .
are you okay ?
okay , mr. han@@ go@@ ver .
you 're kind of fre@@ aking me out a little bit , sophie .
can you ?
time , you know .

well , i mean , there 's the ...
i know you only had a little bit of it
well ..
all right . that 's not what i 'm talking about .
i imagined like horse@@ back riding
what if this is something that i want to do ?
i want to help our relationship .
how long have you been here , by the way ?
no , i mean , in the guest house .
oh . someone 's in detective mode .
that 's okay . i don 't mind .
i think i have a pretty good sense of it .
it is . would you like to go on a walk with me ?
it 's your vacation , too .
i 'll see you in a little bit , sophie .
wh@@ oa
i think when you go in there
oh , no , no , swee@@ tie .
what if they disappear or something , you know ?
i 'm just saying what 's the harm in letting
give me your hand .
you were sp@@ ying on me .
over 20 .
yeah , but you know , we didn 't agree
are you serious ?
i was roc@@ king your body in there .
i 'm sorry . i can see how
it 's a little confusing . sorry .
okay .
how was it in general though ?
it 's so strange . it 's really odd .
you were funny and charming , and you just kept telling me
he is you@@ .he 's just a little ...
a little what
you 're not saying that like it 's like ..
no , no , no , no , no .
not at all . that 's the crazy thing
no . no , not really .
you know what , the hair .
the hair ?
it 's like , like kind of
don 't worry about it .
oh , and you know what , you don 't wear glasses .
i would have .. so what do you think it was ?
yeah , and to me that 's a logical conclusion .
can i help you with something ?
we all go home tomorrow ,
yeah , that 's right . they do .
all right
you can drive yourself nuts trying to derive meaning
it is , isn 't it ?
now we all know how electricity works ,
does he ruin it by questioning how or why ?
don 't worry about it . i got it
should we finish it
has e@@ than .. i mean your e@@ than
like he knew when i was going to go in the house
and you want to know if we shared our experiences also .
i can see that .
i knew you had the aces .
almost too good .
he clearly just let you win .
come on , guys .
the reason he 's not being fun is because he 's not even playing
all right . fine . i 'll play .
come on .
okay . all right . that 's the spirit .
let 's go .
how many cards do you want ?
e@@ than , just calm down .
t don 't want to take all the credit here
do you want to tell her or should t ?
i think it 's important that sophie knows what 's going on .
would everybody just tell me what we 're talking about ?
it 's nothing
he didn 't go to the grocery store .
i can 't fucking pretend to be you .. i am me .
just shut up ! sophie , please .
i didn 't want to make like a thing here .
if you want to like take the guest house , you 'd be welcome .
no , i want you to leave .
hey . it 's e@@ than .
maybe next session you can send us
alright , so we have to hit the keys at the exact same time .
on three , okay ?
you want to get changed ?
we 're probably the same size .
do you have anything like that ?
come on , girls . let 's go .
great . thanks so much .
um , well , my tooth@@ paste and tooth@@ brush is over there .
sure , i 'll get you something
hey . did you find some clothes for her ?

in fact , they called me their honorary je@@ w .
well , you 're no ri@@ v@@ ka sh@@ em@@ shel@@ e@@ witz .
i did three times and no return .
all those years i thought we were family .
i don 't know , ignoring your needs
caroline chan@@ ning , caroline chan@@ ning .

it 's been a few years , but trust me ,
how else do you think i landed
i 'm sorry .
i was very close to my neighbors , the kle@@ ins .

how would you like it if i told your mother
damn , son !

max , she should know .
just keep it to yourself for five minutes and we 're gone .
ma , this is max who made the ko@@ sh@@ er cup@@ cakes .
max , what are you talking about ?
yes , well , maybe my rab@@ bi didn 't have such high standards .
so close .
yes , you told me about tradition and family .
and she was nice enough to put it on my head
i like a party as much as the next man ,
oh , shel@@ don , we don 't need a meeting every three months .
lucky for you it 's tomorrow .
well , you have to go .
this meeting is a waste of time .
you realize one of them has sugar on the rais@@ ins .
and yet you get to weigh in .
well , we 'll just see about that .
he says he 's not coming to the roommate agreement meeting tomorrow .
you have fun . i will not be attending .
meeting .
which means i 'm gonna have to google " how to play catch . "
you know how guys are .
i mean , look at me .
don 't get too fond of this character . "
yeah , but i won 't say who it is .
wait , what is going on ?
as long as i don 't have to watch with him .
i 'll go over here .
from amy .
because you were defending shel@@ don like you always do .
oh , yes , you do . you know you have a weird
that 's different .
um , guys ?
your infections , you mean .
and you didn 't even do that right .
i can afford any hospital in the world ,
i 've been here for three weeks .
discharge her , please . i 'll pay you .
now get me out@@ ta here before i sue your balls off .
give me a number .
after we inform mr. bec@@ ker@@ t 's family ,
oh , it doesn 't matter . i 'm gonna shut it down , pending the autopsy .
i thought dr@@ .@@ bail@@ ey said torres can 't be moved yet .
i think it 'll do the both of them good .
why do you even ask me these things , huh ?
i need your help with something .
it was never opened , so it needs to go back into the lot .
i heard about your patient . i 'm sorry .
have a good night .
henry , will you open the door ?
my super cute tee !
right up there with the b@@ ong with a chin strap
they are making a fortune on us .
this is our attorney . mr ....
and he is holding our cease and desist
is that a bad thing ?
and he 's real good .
how ? i 'm your roommate .
hello , girls , you all look very nice .
you are ! oh ! you got it .
" merry christmas . what are you getting this year ? "

oh , my par@@ tri@@ d@@ ge-@@ in-@@ a-@@ pe@@ ar-@@ tree underwear needs washing .
come on , snow@@ y . i 'll race you .
sorry , guys !
can i ask you a few questions ?
gu@@ ac@@ am@@ ole ? what is it made from ?
can i have $ 150 a day , please ?
alex doesn 't cook .
he analyzed the breakfast you gave him
he 's a great kid , isn 't he ?
sometimes , i feel like a hy@@ pe@@ d-up
your female energy .
you said , you , you said , " go ! take some time . "
everybody at home is blaming me , y@@ elling at me ,
all that matters is what 's happening to you .
all i have ever done is try to help you .
exactly ! b@@ ingo ! par@@ tri@@ dge in a pe@@ ar tree !
then i guess , that 's all there is to say .
i 'm going to the north pole
that 's amazing ! oh , alex would love that so much .
i think she just feels obligated .
i 'm gonna stay at home , put a frozen pizza in the oven
i 'm glad you enjoyed it .
probably never .
well , i do have somewhere i need to be for christmas .
because you 're nice . i mean , officially .
it was jol@@ ly .
oh , well , look at you .
now that is very mature .
how did you get here ?
pol@@ ly ! look who it is .
how many people wear g@@ ing@@ er@@ bread de@@ od@@ or@@ ant ?
" no@@ elle , i know i was angry ,
which still makes it my best christmas in a long time .
wait , so you believe what i told you ?
but to get out of here , stop talking about the north pole ,
see ?
these things happen .
the question is , what really makes a santa ?
no@@ elle , can you inspire us ?
i used to think christmas was the best day of the year .
it should say there , in the file .
a long time .
when did you start ?
i was a drunk
how do you feel about the girl ?
which was ? why ?
we face these decisions every day , and we vote up or down .
to determine whether you are fit to remain in the field .
me taking care of the girl , me taking care of the police
black@@ leg min@@ er .
you and another team , alternating shifts . three days each .
whatever it takes .
do the job , emer@@ son .
'll inform the authorities
sure . we 're coordinating troop movements in afghanistan .
when i didn 't get off the train right away ,
what i already knew . yeah , i got it .
i was trying to make a joke about
they 're gonna use it again .
they could have had david and me@@ red@@ ith 's code but not ours .
take a deep breath .
" cardi@@ ff , aberdeen , glasgow , bel@@ fast , oxford , sl@@ ough . "
the station 's been compromised .
om@@ ne moment .
okay .
well , you have a piece of truck in your leg .
gri@@ t your teeth .
but it 's gonna be okay , right ?
emer@@ son , lie to a girl , will you ?
emer@@ son !
i thought you left me .
little while . not long
so , what ? what ? they wanted to stop the broadcasts ?
sit back down
we 're fine . ve were am@@ bus@@ hed calm down .
stop walking around on your leg .
we 're clear
oh , my god , it 's david .
they must have thought he was dead . bled out .
if i wanted to cri@@ pple the system in one fell sw@@ o@@ op ,
i mean , what the hell do they want with us ?
grab that . let 's go .
bodies . dead people . seeing them .
there 's stuff on here , but it 's password protected .
i don 't know . i 'm trying
good . just keep working
yeah , what do you wanna talk about ?
not really my strong suit , ka@@ therine .
oh , that was just a lucky guess .
you fit a profile .
civilian broadcasters have a certain , you know , personality trait
indifferent and emotionally detached from reality .
willing to sit silently in one place for hours at a time
no , i had a stable childhood
striking lack of empathy or compassion for other people .
you know , i , um , didn 't always do this .
i was on the other end of the numbers .
recruited me straight out of college .
told me i 'd do special things , important things .
him@@ m ..
they know how to use it . they 're good at it .
where are you going ?
i 'm stuck here with you . yeah .
what have you got outside of this ? bo you have a life ?
what do you mean " how does it matter "
m@@ m@@ m-@@ hmm ... this is all you 've got .
you 're on the other side of the fucking numbers .
you think you 're not a part of this , huh ?
what 's wrong with you ? what are you doing here ?
no , you can live a long time like this .
can you take the bullet out ?
here .
wait .
we 'll put the billi@@ ard room through there , eh ?
best bloody billi@@ ard players in the world , australians .
well , ask anyone .
yeah , it 's boris . it 's a farm building .
solid as bloody gibraltar .
your point being ?
now they 're being mined from underneath .
if he 's not , then he should be back on duty .
if you want my opinion , neither should you .
wouldn 't like to think we were over here
hides it well .
seems a shame to waste this .
oh , rather !
it 's alright , ti@@ ffin . it 's alright , son .
oliver , is that you ?
colin , gordon , round the back .
hey , hey , wait . that 's not fair !
ah . well , you 're too late , i 'm afraid . he 's joined up .
of course .
you know , we thought the head@@ hunters might have got you .
tell you something , though , mrs w@@ ad@@ dell ,
so , when i arrived i loosen@@ ed the gir@@ th .
are you sure you 're not injured ?
thank you for the tea , mrs w@@ ad@@ dell .
oliver .
anything ?
it 's just making it darker .
not enough oxygen for it to burn .
could be worse .
well , they could send us to hill 60 .
mess@@ ines ridge , just across the border , near wi@@ pers ' .
still don 't know what i heard , but .
maybe i never heard no germans .
don 't make no difference .
oh , bloody generous of ' em .
probably not a good idea , corp .
we was ready to give up on you , pull through .
well , we was .
finish your letter , walt , or get some more shu@@ t-@@ eye .
and that 's why we kept digging .
and how much explosive charge would you need to demol@@ ish that building ?
how much would you need to do the job properly ?
do we have that in the stores or do we have to requisition it ?
there 's a listening post at 105 drive .
if we drove north from there ,
let 's have it done before sun@@ -up , 0@@ 400 .
i 'll have the artillery give you one hour .
he couldn 't get out of here fast enough .
it 'll mean going over the bags ...
i nearly for@@ go@@ t-@@ a present from frit@@ z .
you 'll be right , l@@ ads .
too early for the grey hen , sir ?
come on , son .
decent fit .
when we get back ,
your boy 's gonna make a great prop forward .
you join up together ?
gets the young fel@@ la all excited with his stories of adventure
el@@ sa 's nearly had bloody kit@@ tens , hasn 't she , walt ?
... i 'd like to ask you something .
and .
it goes so deep under german lines ,
yeah , the blue clay 's further down .
keeping the water out was their main problem .
now it 's ours .
right below german lines .
the blue clay of flan@@ ders .
major north , 3rd canadian tun@@ n@@ ell@@ ers .
he can 't get at us . oh no no no .
i 've never seen anything like this before .
500 feet down there is a cater@@ pillar mine .
there 's 21 of them .
you know , when this thing blows
all we have to do is keep the bloody thing dry
he thinks we 're digging wells .
water see@@ ps down , pools above the clay .
we have 60 blo@@ kes manning the pumps night and day
where did they get this lot ?
yes , when it came to a crisis ,
even if b@@ ree herself would have preferred to be a passenger .
what am i supposed to do ?
well , apparently , jane doesn 't play by the same rules .
can you believe this guy ?
yeah . that 's a healthy attitude .
bows of fruit .
as a matter of fact , i did .
okay , again , as a former teacher ,
her technique is atro@@ cious .
and i love it .
i think we already have .
hey , hey , hey , enough with the screaming !
what are we having ? sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti and me@@ at-@@ shapes ?
is daddy eating with us ?
cel@@ ia ! use a fork , not the doll .
can we rent it again
i know , but we always plan our vac@@ ations in the fall .
you can 't promise that , carlos .
nothing 's happened . relax .
i 'm just saying , a cop could show up at the door any day
sure , we do . we named a guardian when we did our will .
we were really a family then .
of course . oh , of course . it 's just ..
you should go wait out on the porch .
legitimate wh@@ ining .
you guys have a problem with ?
you 've got two , and they 're both ...
what :
i was gonna say " spir@@ ited . "
they 've changed . they 're all grown up now .
so well-@@ behaved .
you know what ? that 's a great idea .
okay .
did you say anything to her about not liking jane ?
okay .
hey , don 't blame me .
you made your bed ... with someone else .
b@@ ree ?
i wanted to celebrate your first day of construction
there was a little problem .
not yet .
um , they dug it up halloween night ,
" cause i keep hoping i 'll find a way out of this .
they shut it down . i lose a lot of time ,
it must be so tempting to just ..
i 'm sure you 've considered re-@@ bur@@ ying it
y-@@ yeah , yeah . of course i have .
and i ...
this is why i like her in bed .
so as you can see , susan , i 'm a little busy ,
i am totally adri@@ ft in that class .
would it help if i told you what your grade is ?
i don 't get it . what were you thinking ?
sorry .
well , he 's a delight .
does this have something to do with , uh ..
yes .
well , it 's pretty hard to build a case without a body .
why would you do that for me ?
i might need something from you .
i thought we were going to the mall .
you know why he 's sitting over there ?
then he shouldn 't have left us for jane .
he didn 't leave us . he left me .
there 's no bad guys here .
and i know he would love to play catch with his daughter .
you , uh , want something to drink ?
this isn 't a social visit . i need to ask you something ,
oh , and my self-esteem could really use
the guy is sending a private plane for me .
that 's how good i am in bed .
what is all of the excitement ?
we 're going to the gram@@ m@@ ys .
do you think you 'll meet 2 chain@@ z ?
no , he can 't be your bo@@ i , he 's my bo@@ i .
this reminds me so much of the plane we used to have .
max , this was my plane .
wait , if this was my plane ...
there 'd be something i hid down here for an emergency .
ye@@ p . my chan@@ el lip glo@@ ss .
just in case something went wrong .
you know they don 't care what you look like
i have no idea .
i should tell you i took $ 10 out of the cup@@ cake fund
okay , everybody . we got a bit of a situation .
kate . " everyone 's assembling at yan@@ kee stadium .
" i don 't know what to do . "
oh , i just ignored her .
i didn 't even try .
that 's the last voic@@ email i have from her .
okay , yeah , i 'm just gonna start at 1700 .
i just hope my mom 's okay .
su , you can 't just think about ... yeah , right .
you 're good , are you okay ?
i hid the bullets too , in a separate place .
yeah .
okay . yeah , like passports and birth certificates .
we have sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti squ@@ ash , micro greens ,
mach@@ a 's ow@@ ls might even come here
sa@@ o@@ ir@@ se , it 's just one of mum 's stories .
the child .
this is the last straw now .
now look , you 've caught a cold .
wh@@ a ....
she 's not safe in this awful place .
dad , where did she get this ?
i can 't lose her , too , bron@@ ach .
i 'm not going . you can 't make me .
so , you 'd better stop this nonsense
would you say that could be her ?
what do you think you 're doing ?
you 're going to stay at gran@@ ny 's .
her real coat .
do you hear that , l@@ ads ? we are saved
good thinking , sa@@ o@@ ir@@ se .
thanks .
there 'd better not be any s@@ not on it .
maybe we can take a short cut .
careful , lad .
wh@@ oa , each hair holds a story ?
that 's right .
his heart was broken into pieces
what 's wrong
ml@@ ach@@ a has her no w .
she 'll be turned to stone soon , no doubt
and we 'll all share in her fate
not the way i do .
you 're so full of emotions .
nasty , terrible things .
you worry so much
my son lost someone , too , a long time ago .
now , if someone said that they could take that pain away ,
that 's all i do , ben .
it doesn 't hurt . it will never hurt again .
there is no way out .
come here , cu . keep the old witch quiet , will you ?
it 's not your fault , it never was .
i 'm sorry .
iu@@ have been so lost for so long
i couldn 't bear to see my son suffering so much .
please , mach@@ a , my sister is sick . please , help us .
obviously this movie is very important to me , you know ?
yeah , i 'm in a meeting , but if you wait a second ..
no , no , no , no . they 're okay . they 're okay .

can you give me a call back as soon as you can ?
okay . is it going to come back on ?
okay , thank you .
yo , man , what 's up ?
maybe a nice guy , but , you know , he 's just not a director .
what the hell happened to my career , man ?
how 's the room ? the room ? who cares about the room , man ?
he 's still a fan , man , but he thinks you 're a little old for the way they 're going .
you know what we need is that game chan@@ ger
you have to trust and be patient .
y@@ up .
i don 't think i 'm going to make it back for that one o 'clock rehearsal . i should ..
shit , i don 't have the number . hey , junior , you got it ?

come on , man , you can do better than that
hey , hey , hey ! i 'm not as dumb as you think .
we hope to be in contact with him shortly to get him the help that he needs . "
but now you gon ' tell me a real story .
ex-@@ cop .
got dismissed from the force about a year and a half ago .
got me on a heavy domestic .
i did a year .
can 't see my kids no more .
and that 's all because of the story you gon ' tell me right now .
yeah ?
so , i gave her a ride home from work , right ?
we talked , hung out , had a few drinks .
she starts telling me about her sc@@ um@@ bag of a husband .
i just listened , man .
i wanted to hold her , so i did .
all right , now , i '@@ m-@@ a stay out here . you go on and do your business .
you all right in there ?
come on , let 's get you going .

i '@@ m-@@ a bring it right back .
do you want me to page
miranda , there you are .
uh , you all right ? is everything okay ?
tell me he 's not lying somewhere in a ditch dead .
so why didn 't he answer his pag@@ er or his cell phone ?
and why doesn 't anybody in this hospital
dementia . the guy was useless .
it 's possible .
and if he fell and hit his head ,
he could have a sub@@ ar@@ ach@@ no@@ id hemorrhage .
i 'm not here to get my job back .
dr. singer ..
o@@ oh , what 's happening ? what 's happening ?
it 'll give you the most direct approach .
i-i just need to talk to the chief about something .
don 't know how long she 's staying , if she 's staying .
that 's all i know .
and by the time you realized what time it was
chief .
the chief has emergency surgery .
the new attending doesn 't even know how to put in
did you or did you not ask this man
you finish each other 's sentences .
you 're more married to that man than i am .
excuse me ?
you look out for each other . you take care of each other .
excuse me ?
he 's my work-@@ husband ,
all right . talk me through the procedure .
no , that was actually a teaching moment .
dr. a@@ very , what can we in@@ fer from this ?
yes , in the left ventricular wall .
already there .
it does that on its own .
i guess i 'm the one who learned something today .
chief .
and that a man in your position has certain ...
and that , uh , when a man
are you hitting on me ?
and i was not hitting on you .
dr. per@@ cy is almost done
that makes two of us .
so what 's going on with you and kare@@ v ?
how is that any of your business ?
it 's all anybody talks about around here .
i mean , he knows how important this is to me .
and he brings me , like , this desert storm bar@@ bie
have you even talked to iz@@ z@@ ie yet ?
you know what ? no one 's allowed to talk about iz@@ z@@ ie while i eat .
what :
oh , yeah ? well , take a look around .
it 's a 45-@@ minute surgery .
a fe@@ br@@ ile seizure at 3 months .
and did he scream a lot when you brought him home from the hospital ?
and has his asthma gotten better or worse as he 's gotten older ?
okay . thanks .
can 't we just go to big boy ?
well , the barbec@@ ue burger is like the big boy .
because you 're not at big boy !
make it two .
what 's the matter ?
how can she take your order
you stick electrodes in a rat 's brain , give him an orgas@@ m button ,
well , the only difference between us and the rat
yeah , well , i 'm just glad to be a part of it .
in fact , we 're going to save that crazy lady 's life
told you i saw a lion .
is this about cris@@ tina again ?
i wish i could take it back .
oh , quit it . stop thinking about the hot orth@@ o nurse .
i-i could see it in those eyes .
what happened then ?
i sho@@ ved my arm right into his mouth .
who the hell feeds himself to a lion ?
what do we got ?
yeah , that 's what you expect when you hear " lion . "
she never bothered to mention she had a pet lion ?
so i dis@@ sect out and remove the animal cad@@ a@@ ver hearts .
correct . and why do we do that ?
like stripping a house down to its frame only .
we are wi@@ ping them clean ,
when we inject them with stem cells ...
let 's grow ourselves some new hearts .
but you 're still a student ,
are you gonna tell mark to move in with julia ?
we don 't talk about stuff like this .
you 're not using the oil .
we 're only in town till tomorrow .
mr. car@@ roll , you 're experiencing a heart attack .
can you tell me what you were doing
and it was like a piano fell
you weren 't running or anything else
we saw a lion .
don 't you think , that thing with colle@@ en ?
yeah , she gets like that .
she gets like that , like you know how she gets ,
what ? it 's not ... what ? i 'm just asking .
oh , we were . we were a ... a little bit of a thing
well , it didn 't even occur to me .
okay , you know what ? we 're not doing this .
kare@@ v . i know about kare@@ v .
what , five ? ten ? a hundred ?
no , no , no , no , no . you can 't just go .
" you 're ignoring me . you 're a total ... "
if you need to step away , just say so .
yes , we are , doctor .
she needs to figure out how to take care of herself
there is no time like the present to embrace it .
all right . removing the aor@@ tic cross-@@ clamp now .
damn it . the ventric@@ le 's rup@@ tured .
they should .
gotta be why she didn 't tell me that kir@@ by was a lion .
we met on a dating site .
so adventu@@ rous ,
son , you are a hero .
so ... i saved her ?
really ?
when your surgery was finished ..
i thought that she had fallen asleep ,
it 's just a sound effect .
they are watching to make sure
learn to have some fun in your life . je@@ ez .
what is that ?
everything is safe . everything is careful .
and we provided them with a box seat
but every year , they demand more .
more interesting subjects .
last year , they had college athletes ..
sit down , harry .
don 't make me tell you twice .
there 's an hierarchy around here ,
some of them are quite pleasant and fun ,
in no uncertain terms , i 'll pay you a decent sum
i 'm a fair man and i expect you to do what i ask ,

i 'm back and i 'm here to stay .
what i 'm saying , exactly , is if we 're going to go on
where the fuck is all my money ?
i been meaning to sort out my properties for a@@ while now .
being a landlord is not to everyone 's taste , running a pub ,
it 's a lovely five bedroom flat upstairs
you 're welcome rita .
charles thought you were jack bos@@ by ,
sorry jack .
came to visit you in hospital the first time ,
we were having a fight when he ...
honey , the doctors here are great .
you have nothing to worry about .
but i am trying hard to be strong ,
then we won 't comfort .
i know you 're not a child ,
why should you f@@ end for yourself
what kind of fre@@ ak are you ? just leave me alone .
i told you that i am fine . stop acting like my mother and go home .
your father 's not coming back .
the girls and i were talking and we think maybe paul young killed mrs. hu@@ ber
how can we move forward if you won 't communicate with me ?
gab@@ by , thank god you 're doing this .
yes , well , carlos , in some circles ,
i 'm about to be the mother of your child ,
you 're going to get up , without saying one word .
he 's a good person .
so don 't mess this up .
my marriage is a bit strained .
no one 's been convicted yet , mrs. sol@@ is . this is just a grand jury hearing .
oh . right .
any@@ ways , he was placed under house arrest
well , i didn 't exactly ease his mind .
before carlos ' house arrest , he was always working and he was never with me .
he would realize he loved me .
is there a point to this ?
she did some terrible , crazy , selfish stuff .
if 's complicated .
and just like that , my husband began sharing my secrets .
secrets i had died to protect .
hello .
nice to meet you . ir@@ ina .
oh , she 's more than a friend , mom . we 're in love .
she wants nothing to do with your son .
hey , this is ana . leave a message .
drop dead .
ason v@@ ale cotton
well , i am sorry you don 't appreciate him .
in fact , i have decided to give him a promotion .
vice president .
well , a company can have more than one .
are we done sharing ?
wow . so paris , prague , madrid ...
but you still haven 't told us how you two met .
you know , if you 're right , she 'll move on soon enough .
i need to talk to you guys .
i proposed to ir@@ ina , and she said yes .
you proposed ?
yeah . but she 's the one . i know it .
it 's not the fe@@ ds i 'm worried about .
patrick logan ?
that 's how he 'll find me .
patrick logan does not care about you .
ma , please .
robin the stri@@ pper ?

does sam allen live here ?
oh . then i guess i 'll just , uh , lee these on his porch .
put it inside . if 's un@@ locked .
what are you doing with a picture of rex ?
he was my father .
this is not how i wanted you to find out . i am so sorry .
ir@@ ina really loved the ring , mom . that 's why she wanted
you sure ? n@@ ana 's ring is worth a lot more
but i want your mother to know
he was single , so was she .
when she found out she was pregnant , she called him .
he offered to support her financially ,
just tell her i can 't come .
she 's 93 .
no , hang on . i followed all the protocols
i checked the tire pressure on the car .
f@@ yi , it 's none .
you use it to get your way .
the fact that the right way is also my way
you 're coming with me .
women like a firm hand on the til@@ ler .
i got a book ; it didn 't help .
now , i downloaded an app that
i 'm smart as a whip .
hey , listen , i kind of made plans
do whatever you want .
really , what were you hoping for ?
and that would turn you on a little .
do you mind if i spend the weekend
you mean i wouldn 't see you at all ?
no , no ..
you can 't put a sadd@@ le on leonard ho@@ f@@ stad@@ ter .
back in om@@ aha , there are two different restaurants
you 're in charge of healing all of us , not just howard .
yeah , i don 't think saving people is really for us .
they 'll do it for free .
five thousand up front .
this is what i 'm talking about . clean lines , nothing to profile .
what i 'm talking about , sal , is you transporting anything and everything
but we gotta talk about our cut .
you know , i just remembered something . i need batteries and toilet paper .
the one where he turns back into a fucking baby ?
i wonder where i could get all these items in one convenient location ?
i 'm gonna start using that shit .
.. look at my future empire as the wal@@ mart of bottom@@ -@@ dollar retail crime .

sad as it is , van@@ ell@@ ope cannot be allowed to race .

but she re@@ buff@@ ed my affec@@ tions .
felix , pull yourself together .

excuse me , general .
he has blood in his eyes .
but look at his neck
why are you here ?
believe me , these children are not important to moscow .
remember , you are not in moscow anymore .
if you do anything to endanger my team .
if you portray my officers as incompetent .
i gave you a false name
they do whatever they need to do to survive .
what choice did i have ?
hmm .
and then the boy in moscow .
this boy in moscow is the son of a very good friend of mine .

covered up by party dogs like you and i .
he will keep killing and killing

he wants us to drop in .
i mean , we could drive by and just look at it .
and i just can 't hide it .
we 're still fig@@ uring how much remo@@ del@@ ing we want to do .
i think i can sell it if we call it ,
how about i arm@@ -@@ wrest@@ le you ?
it 's like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest .
i would do that .
you grew up with a table .
bern@@ ade@@ tte , for every episode of doctor who

it 's rum@@ bling . it 's going crazy and ..
and suddenly , the barrel explo@@ des with water .
if i had landed that punch , your fate would have been sealed .
and then you 'd be dead .

she thinks she 's funny , but frankly , i 've never been able to see it .
how exactly would one measure a sense of humor ?
my friend 's s getting married at disneyland tomorrow night .
and i had to drop off some papers for shel@@ ly to sign for my dad 's estate .
mom just sent you here to spy on me , didn 't she ?

general , go tell my father hercul@@ es is here .
it 's meant to be . it took five years and a thousand men to build her temple .
everyone knows the legend , how her@@ a seeks to destroy hercul@@ es .
stay away from him . men who deal in violence attract violence .
lord co@@ ty@@ s will see you now .
once or twice .
look . magnificent , aren 't they ?
the hy@@ dra 's heads , your majesty .
no wonder men thought they were monsters .
let the people have their hero .
amphi@@ ar@@ aus ?
it is said you have glim@@ p@@ sed your own death ,
only what the gods see fit to reveal .
when you fight , the wall is your armor .
remember these words ,
halt !
alt !
leave the chari@@ ots . we 'll go down on foot .
i hate being right all the time .
this head is ro@@ tting .
we 're here to help them . why are they attacking ?
turn comrades against each other .
but just to avoid future misunderstandings ,
another mistake , i 'll end you myself .
i 'm sorry . i never knew my father .
and someday , he will make a fine king .
do they live in athens ? thank you for your care .
how could you do such a terrible thing ? by law , i should execute you ,
the great hercul@@ es .
my family was gone . everyone was gone .
he became my brother@@ -in-@@ arms .
it can cloud their minds . we call it the blood rage .
he made me vo@@ w to keep the world away from him .
and that , my lady , is the truth .
well , much as birds take flight , so , too , are these shields lighter than air .
try on the helmet of hercul@@ es .
forged after hercul@@ es ' very own helmet , when he defeated the demon ger@@ yon .
cen@@ ta@@ urs .
he saw shadows in the night .
will fall . you want to stop rhe@@ sus ?
it 'll slow down our chari@@ ots . a gamble .
the scouts have returned . rhe@@ sus has made his camp in mount as@@ tic@@ us ,
the gods have been anno@@ y@@ ingly silent on that matter .
when will you die ?
oh , cheer up , hercul@@ es .
i 'm ready for what 's next .
don 't do anything foolish .
i saw pity in your eyes for rhe@@ sus . why ?
you lie very well . clearly , your father 's daughter .
if i dis@@ obeyed co@@ ty@@ s or resisted in any way , arius would be executed .
my husband was king . and co@@ ty@@ s poisoned him to take his place .
i had dreams of ruling this kingdom .
my thousands will train more thousands , and they even more .
what you began here can never be stopped .
spare me the moral outrage .
getting us all killed , bad idea .
you will be paid in full . bring them the gold .
take mine , too .
there will be no more innocent blood on my hands .
oh , i see . and who 's gonna be paying us for this suic@@ idal endeavor ?
he paid ts to save th@@ race . let 's not dis@@ appoint him .
lay down your arms ! or your nephew dies first .
confused , hercul@@ es ?
king eur@@ ys@@ the@@ us and i will now rule all of greece .
speak a little louder , hercul@@ es .
before they saw you as their king ?
precisely ! your sin , hercul@@ es , was that you had no ambition !
but a man who wants nothing has no price !
i had to ruin your name .
my children !
all of you ! starting with my faith@@ less daughter !
so you 've been seeing other girls ?
does that mean slu@@ tty trol@@ ls ?
i brought you some iced tea .
it 's passion fruit , new on the menu .
oh , sorry .
that 's it ! prepare for marsh@@ mal@@ low death !
so anyway ...
yeah . i think i 'm gonna take her to miniature golf .
i love them . they 're dis@@ gus@@ ting .

this is david gil@@ kes , negoti@@ ator .
for like a second when he pulled the gun .
no , just angry .
we know who the hostage is . he 's from smi@@ there@@ en .
yeah . they contacted the met
shit .
this ... this is a whole plan he 's had going on here .
i find it hard to believe he 's never raised red flags before .
listen , there 's a whole load of police here
you know how they get .
oh , leave me alone .
harris , if we need you , you got a clear shot ?
can you shut up , please ?
chris , i know you 're pretty stressed at the moment .
my name is david ...
well , some people call me that , but really i 'm just a ..
you 'll pretend to be my friend
is that right , david ?
i don 't get that feeling .
well , maybe that 's part of the problem .
they 've got a news van as well .
everyone back behind cover , now .
you are listening in , so listen to this .
if you don 't phone back
that 's final . okay ? it 's final .
i 'm sorry .
bill , i 'm here .
funny .
why me ?
morning , swe@@ en@@ ey .
got a friend with me here today .
well , you can have a go . i mean , other people have had a go .
have you ? you got big fucking nuts ? let 's have a look at them .
tell me something , lewis .
the job .
so what ?
i work on the front line , son .
sorry , it 's your ti@@ ts .
what you saying ? i gotta lose a bit of weight ?
i suppose i could , erm , lose a couple of kil@@ os for you .
what you looking at ?
i don 't understand . why would someone tell you where our man is ,
what can i say ? i just come about it from a different angle than you , that 's all .
anyway , my new mate here .
just bring me up .
he reck@@ ons our boy allen 's got a little bol@@ t-@@ hole in the countryside .
report to me anything you see . do not come off of channel 6 .
he 's a very capable and dangerous man .
where the fuck are you ?
do you think he 's even in there ?
he 's really got under your skin , hasn 't he , this one ?
not while i 'm swe@@ en@@ ey .
what would be the best way of asking lewis out on a date ?
yeah , nancy .
i wouldn 't bother if i was you , ell@@ is .
i was at a barbec@@ ue .
i wonder how it would really feel to be shot in the head . point blank .
bang !
gone . a full stop on an ordinary life .
bol@@ locks .
you think i carry fucking pork ch@@ ops around with me for the fun of it ?
you seem like a smart man , francis . you shouldn 't underestimate me .
what you got ?
he re-@@ entered the night w@@ extr@@ u saw him with a suitcase .
anyone could have carried his passport .
and you know we only have him in custody for 24 hours .
get it quickly , reg@@ an .
i 'm sick of sne@@ aking about in the shadows .
what ? here in a holiday inn ? it 's not that easy .
ma@@ kin tre@@ bolt , you slag .
he 's a serb , ex-@@ paramilitary .
got an eye for killing witnesses .
what she saw and what she heard we still don 't know ,
mate , you look like shit . you should go home and get some sleep .
look , we all thought it was allen .
you 're no good to us like this .
not with me@@ gan the way she is . you know i can 't .
yeah .
you 'd still be a two-@@ bob thief on the estate sticking brown up your ...
but i 'm the one had to walk through it .
i lost a valuable fucking member of my team today .
why didn 't you protect her , jack ?
r@@ uck !
i couldn 't move . i couldn 't help her .
i can 't live like this . i just need your help . i 'm on the fucking ropes here .
i told you in the cells .
wrong fucking answer .
he paid me .. he paid ... . allen paid me !
keep your hands behind your head !
lower your weapons , boys .
gotta say i 'm disappointed it was you , carter .
there 's your man .
i told you , i know where tre@@ bolt 's at , i know where he 's going .
i just got you off the hook and it won 't happen again .
you can take all your intelligence down to the n@@ ci when they interview you .
you 're just gonna leave jack in prison ? locked up like a criminal ?
you worked out all the math .
i wrote a paper .
i wrote a paper on our idea .
our idea is really good .
you know , if no one 's thought of this , yet ,
uh , another one says , " the concept shows
i do , indeed , mr. box@@ -@@ thinking .
mr. can@@ -@@ you-@@ belie@@ ve-@@ thes@@ e-@@ jack@@ -@@ asses ?
" the analogy between space-@@ time
who wrote that ?
uh , don 't lower yourself to their level .
and failing that ,
there 's no upside to doing this .
what does it say ?
maybe space-@@ time is like two clow@@ ns
you mess with the bull , you get the horns .
somebody else do it .
i think i might be turning into a killer gor@@ illa .
i 'm starting to miss that .
what 's taking him so long ?
yeah , i do . no matter how he responds ,
i 've , uh , created some other user accounts
all she long@@ ed to ask was
i 'm so sick of people being mean on the internet .
interesting .
never noticed that about you .
so ... this is gonna be a thing .
um , while you 're here ,
no . looks , uh , normal . what are you doing here ?
yeah , i do . i 'm not here .
looks like you 're here to me , which is good ,
you 're getting suspended ?
it requires a full cast on the broken leg , connected to
and because your son is so young ,
as soon as an o.@@ r. opens up ,
the losers in medical records aren 't answering .
floor seats .
i know it is done by many medical professionals in this hospital .
eli lloyd ... do not test me .
all the intensely exciting , to@@ e-@@ cur@@ ling potential ...
dr. bail@@ ey .
just don 't take it with alcohol .
we 're missing our anniversary dinner
i 'm sorry . gia . i am . but it really hurts .
well , i-i brought lots of magazines and a good novel .

hey , ke@@ p@@ ner .
even if i were good at forging signatures , i wouldn 't do it .
you 're just gonna have to finish signing your charts on your own .
get him in for p.@@ a. and lateral films ,
that 's what boarding schools are for .
trauma 2 .
you cannot drink beer in here .
oliver , did you see dr. al@@ t@@ man ?
we caught the stroke ear@@ ly@@ . which is very good .
you should cancel the trip .
looks like the blade landed in the max@@ illary sin@@ us .
excuse me .
no , no problem . um , really .
although he 's probably sick of me by now .
you didn 't mention he used to play pro ball .
it 's not a big deal , really .
look , i don 't mean to hold you guys up .
doesn 't look like it from this .
he should be out of surgery any minute .
one , two ...
so now can we get out@@ ta here ?
pupils are equal and reactive . he 's alert and awake .
he needs surgery . book an o.@@ r ..
no time .
he needs surgery right now .
all right . here we go .
all right . let clear it .
come on . come on . come on .
and open him as soon as possible .
even then , if that aor@@ ta tears ,
i know . i know .
just pour the bet@@ ad@@ ine straight on to the chest .
all right . plug me in .
he 's dic .
let 's push 3 of ep@@ i . set me up for another shock .
damn it .
there 's nothing . his aor@@ ta is in sh@@ reds .
you know , it 's not that i don 't want to share you .
oh . okay .
do you know how old i was when your parents died ?
twenty-@@ two , younger than you , but i took you in .
it 's not your fault .
do you have any idea what i had to give up ?
and because you go above and beyond .
say it with me .
.. like no one else can .
fifth year is the hardest year of your residency .
in just a few months , you will ...
you 're o.@@ b. now ?
she mis@@ ses z@@ ola . her uter@@ us hurts .
you are embarrassing me .
i 'm making life , you know ?
like what is the deal
well , if i give you all the answers ,
hi . how 's your day going ?
right .
no kissing in the hospital .
we don 't work together anymore .
it 's called a-@@ a rash guard . you wear it at the pool .
clearly you 've never been to palm beach .
i can 't get through to this guy .
i really shouldn 't talk about it .
bail@@ ey 's not gonna find out about it ?
i 'm not telling her cra@@ p .
and i can 't pick up the short ribs .
why are you so gun@@ g-@@ ho to do this ?
we could roast a chicken .
could we please shut up about dinner ?
oh , sorry .
what ? no .
so i 'm gonna secure the cage temporarily and close .
problem solved .
g. is healthy .
yes , but i think i 'm on to something , though .
i 'll tell you when i figure it out .
you just have to line up the arrows .
look , uh .
and i-i know i 'm the bad guy here , but ...
i want to be happy , you know ?
maybe a couple more months .
maybe they 're just not surviving because of other causes .
exactly . okay . bump me .
the device is working ,
it doesn 't matter .
and who do you think you are ?
dr. bail@@ ey , she was just doing
i mean , to put your hands on another clinical trial
read my research .
okay . i 've cleared out the tumor
it 's like a line of defense .
it grows on both sides of the brain
i have to defend every decision
i-i ...
you take crazy risks in the o.@@ r .
safe ,
i get it . fifth year is competitive .
an orgas@@ m is an orgas@@ m .
don 't let fifth year get to you .
please .
aren 't these y@@ um ?
are you sure ? ' cause i don 't think it drank itself .
look , i have no problem drinking .
but , " a , " not with my parents ,
so , i 'll go get you guys some more water ,
he seems like a real go-@@ ge@@ tter , huh ?
i wonder what he wants to do with his life .
i think that 's very common ,
yeah , you do .
hey , brian , you 're a young guy .
there it is again .
jay , you have to make this right with shor@@ ty .
i don 't know what you 're talking about , and neither do you .
you were gone .
i didn 't have a choice .
so what 's the new plan ?
yeah .
far as i can tell , we have two options .
he can go to hell .
you wouldn 't last a second in there with sam@@ my .
then i guess we 'll just have to out@@ source .
you 're delta force ? like chuck nor@@ ris ?
excuse me a second .
hey , once you get the hang of it ,
too bad what ?
no , no. you were saying ... ?
not through sco@@ field .
i 'm not trying to get on your bad side either .
i believe you .
i keep my promises .
cashier 's check payable to cas@@ h. same thing .
keep your ears open , sugar .
hold it steady ! i am ! i am !
come on .
i never thought i 'd say this ,
the sooner he 's dead , the sooner we can get on the escape .
you 're in .
we got to call off the fight .
no , no , no ,
no , that 's it ! i can 't go against
this isn 't the best neighborhood .
just stick close .
you never d have come otherwise .
you know , uh ,
i think this is gonna work .
you know , i run charters , just like i said ..
then one day , that brun@@ ette , g@@ ret@@ chen well , she asked me
so you two have history .
alex , i need a wedge .
look , i took ' em where they wanted me to take ' em .
what ?
this ?
and when you break out of here , you 're gonna do whatever
so why don 't we go back to work ? how 's that sound ?
and by doing so , erase every victory we fought for , including ton@@ igh@@ t@@ '
we could use the technology ourselves , send someone back .
tell you what ?
no one can see the future , re@@ ese .
i cheat .
when i was a kid , it seemed like my mother knew everything .
not really .
once you go back , my knowledge ends .
sky@@ net is a computer program , as long as it 's still being coded it 's contained .
it can 't be stopped .
yeah , we blow it , the hell , up .
what does it matter what i think
that 's the kind of man , your son was
alternate timelines are not complicated
there is a switch , and i will find it .
i will tell him .... just not yet , ok ?
hey , look i got some frame@@ -@@ gra@@ bs from the over@@ pass .
it 's not a bomb
they came out of it .
those two were in 1984
o '@@ bri@@ en , have you been drinking ?
once they show up , it 's their game .
yeah . yeah , i pre-@@ ordered gen@@ is@@ ys weeks ago .
no way i 'm standing in line for it .
what is it ? how did you hear it ?
gen@@ is@@ ys is an operating system ? what 's it do ?
tomorrow , the waiting is over
and i 'm here to tell you that
and now , before we wrap this up ,
i cannot wait to meet you all tomorrow .
let 's see how we 're doing
t@@ n 30 years , you had one place to be
we can 't .
what if that 's what happens ?
you said you 'd follow me to the ends of the earth .
how 'd he find us ? i never told anyone about this place , only pops .
i wouldn 't remember
shoot first ?
what 's that supposed to do ?
the particles will not be able to scatter .
i hate it when he says that .
you got a job in construction ?
not yet .
that 's right . what do you think it is ?
poisoned ?
a man came in with the same symptoms .
little bit every day so it wasn 't obvious .
if it were up to me , i would give you that chance .
the parents ' council has all the power .
well , it would be a stant .
i won 't keep you .
what makes you think i lost it ?
no . i didn 't .
i give you a graceful way to spare my feelings ,
so you 're cour@@ ting me ?
when will you stop playing hard to get ?
you see how much you enjoy sm@@ acking me down ?
come on . one dinner .
well , normally we test stuff
hey . what are you doing tonight ?
oh , thanks , rene@@ e , but i have a date .
that didn 't take long .
i could make something .
is it still 99 cents a minute ?
looks like we should just get this out there .
uh , i did some things that i am not proud of .
it feels like such an intrusion .
then i 'm just in the nick of time .
well , for me ,
is something wrong , b@@ ree ?
i see you 've done due diligence .
and that it hasn 't gone through ,
there is no comparison to what i did .
oh , women can be dangerous , too ,
what can i get you folks to start ?
come on , b@@ ree . calm down . have a drink .
someone 's slipping .
hmm ? what do you think i 'm doing ?
we should have discussed this .
you may call all the shots at work ,
for what it 's worth , your road trip sounds amazing .
i must have hauled her ass in 50 times .
before you knew it , she had a first class catering company ,
actually . i ...
i get it .
i know . way out@@ ta line .
home ?
you were right . found trace amounts of anti@@ freeze ,
well , for one thing , you 'd get tired of tuna cas@@ ser@@ ole .
it 'd be a nasty way to go .
what are you doing ?
turns out i borrowed a nylon bag of death .
for ju@@ an@@ ita . i wanna prove to her
so the kid is scared
i was no better .
we 're not kids anymore .
i guess it 's made us a little g@@ un-@@ shy ...
so what do we do ?
we forget about the crazy digging for dirt
all right .
well , it is lun@@ ch@@ time .
how 'd you know i like indian food ?
i don 't even know why i wanna work at that school again .
it 's positively awful .
i@@ hear he went to the hospital ?
do the doctors know what caused it ?
oh , don 't be .
he 'll be fine .
i 'm sure it 's just what the doctor ordered .
oh , susan .
the grand canyon .
it took six million years to form .
looking at trees and a hole in the ground ?
yeah . yeah , if the grand canyon isn 't your scene ...
you 're bound to love our next stop ..
i don 't want that killer guy to chop off my head .
it would just mean i 'd have to clean it
it 's an actor in a movie .
it 's okay to be scared . it 's even fun sometimes .
what 's that ?
this is what i 'm talking about .
mama , i think it 's the killer .
mom , look !
got@@ cha !
oh , mom , you should 've seen your face .
plastic .
exactly .
so when you cast your vote tonight , kids ,
'@@ cause hawaii has something for every sc@@ av@@ o ,
it is the vacation of a lifetime .
i didn 't wanna do this .
really ? or did they just fail to find the evidence ?
what ?
you 're right . you 're right .
a gru@@ esome helicopter crash .
you think you 're gonna be safer driving across country ?
god , you are a hypo@@ crit@@ e .
ten years ago , christmas ,
well , guess what . i make the money ,
are you okay ? have i been pushing you too hard ?
whe@@ w . i just need to rest for a tiny little ..
i 'm not exactly sure .
i 'm sorry he 's not all ...
check out the ju@@ gs on her .
at my cousin 's funeral !
i am unfit to soci@@ alize with your class@@ y gay boyfriend .
no . you are having dinner with bob ,
we owe him more than we can ever repay .
that was lee . he was the show queen .
oh . okay , well , i wanna get you tickets to something .
beauty page@@ ants ?
ever think the reason lee broke up with you is you 're not gay ?
give me a beer and a college basketball game ,
hey , hey , hey ! you kiss boys with that mouth ?
you wanna go to a game this week ?
just three days , huh ?
i 'm sure it 'll be the end of my relationship with keith .
i just wanna make sure that ...
hire her .
you didn 't worry that working together
well , if you 're cool with this ,
mrs. van de kam@@ p ?
oh . um , i usually see dr. sha@@ pir@@ o .
oh . well , there 's some salt in the wound .
and frankly , you 're in luck .
s it awful ?
it 's like getting a watch
but still , i was hoping you could
so was bob 's college roommate
bob 's college nickname was " f@@ lip@@ per . "
okay , this is crazy .
then he gets them really ham@@ me@@ red .
well , i mean , not literally .
no , thanks . i 'm on the clock .
well , if you 're looking for something to do ,
that is her job .
he won 't tell me why he 's trying to buy all these houses .
hold on .
well , hello there .
will he be gone for a while ?
if sure is a mess in here .
you wanna know what 's going on ? talk to your husband .
that 's between you and him .
i get that .
when i tell people you attacked me ,
you think the police are gonna care about that ?
you can 't be doing this . i already got two strikes .
really , i don 't .
hey , hon .
or you 're gonna play golf ? this sounds like fun .
bob ? you 're going with bob ?
in that case , ditch the moist@@ uri@@ zer .
relax . i already laid the groundwork .
and what did they say about the age difference ?
what ? why ?
i don 't even think they 're gonna notice .
i was . now i just cook for fun .
so as long as it doesn 't come in a can ,
ah , no . mary 's the one with the stories .
yes , take a wild guess .
as matter of fact ,
no . no , because i realize that as a doctor ,
so the army ..
just an idea ,
and maybe you daughter has a favorite character
i 'm barbara fine .
the n@@ anny .
i 'm gonna call my daughter and see if there are
she 's good .
okay , done . you ready to go ?
hey , bob , can i borrow a couple of eggs ?
your husband canceled our golf trip .
he said you think i 'm planning to se@@ duce him .
why would you even go there ?
or should i say " f@@ lip@@ per " ?
did he tell you about
we don 't need to .
what ?
he told me what you 've got planned for our neighbors .
to say the least .
i just couldn 't go back to that table and face your mother .
i was afraid of how you 'd react .
oh , keith ,
i always knew there was an expiration date
you are 17 years younger than me .
not to me .
there are other considerations .
who cares ?
if i didn 't know you any better , i 'd say that you 're one of those
i don 't need a vacation .
and i 'd also like you to know the most-@@ often received
read , rest , travel .
sar@@ cas@@ m ?
that tonight 's gonna be a good night
fine . just get back under your blanket ,
fine .
i know you turned around .
turn it over .
this is really happening .
i 'm gonna wear a beautiful dress and walk down that aisle
they 're gonna need an extra-@@ large veil for somebody 's head .
why wouldn 't you ?
so you 're saying if i became a famous movie star ,
if i 'm gonna be stuck at home with the kids
so , you think about us getting married ?
i think about us getting married ,
joke all you want , but you think about it .
good luck catching a man with that attitude .
this vacation is off to a wonderful stant .
i 'm excited to work with my boyfriend .
way to kill the mood .
we can be like marie curi@@ e and her husband , pierre ,
okay , what do we start with ?
ha@@ -@@ ha , i 'm a fre@@ ak !
wash those be@@ a .
yeah , i 'd better keep an eye out for , what ,
you 're gonna make him do the dishes ?
shel@@ don , you 've never worked in a lab like this before .
i have plenty of experience in biology .
and .
let 's do this .
no " hi , ra@@ i " ?
so , listen , i heard something about him .
o@@ oh , gossip .
so i hung out there for , like , a month ,
follow your heart .
she makes more money than me .
it 's completely reasonable .
yeah , actually , it 's good for both of us
the v@@ esp@@ a 's almost paid off .
it 's the width of a single hair .
so i 'm sure it 's no problem for a genius like you .
i 'm on vacation .
social convention is stupid .
i have ten fingers and ten toes .
what can i get you ?
don 't let me have too many of those .
we 're grown men ; we drink at bars .
everything okay with you and bern@@ ade@@ tte ?
you and amy ? good ?
you know those girls text me every detail of their lives as it happens .
you 've told us that a thousand times , sid .
okay , it 's clear .
papa , there will come a time .
with what mone@@ y. girl ?
i 'd rather die with my face to the enemy than to run away .
i suggest you leave this country as quickly as you can .
my friend needs your help .
you didn 't tell me he was working with the enemy .
i got the note .
we 're going to get you out of here .
i 'm sorry .
" noted economist al@@ tac@@ ke@@ din home . "
i 've been trying to piece this thing together .
yeah , you bored the hell out of ' em , right ?
i don 't know . did you ?
i am trying to be serious here .
hi . i , uh , i called earlier about
let me walk you to the director 's office .
since your husband is declared legally dead ,
okay . when your call came in and kis@@ hi@@ da processed it ..
kan@@ iel ou@@ tis ...
hey , kis@@ hi@@ da ?
okay , but you and i both know who michael sco@@ field was .
the official record .. history ...
now , that 's scary , to think who could be behind that .
it would take a genius .. like michael .
you 're coming with us .
what 's wrong with the suburbs ?
the front line of the war .
pay up .
then you get your money .
yes ?
what am i looking at ?
one of those motion sensor devices you hang on trees ,
amazing .
you know my game , whip .
because you 're my whip hand .
yeah , sure , okay .
be everyone 's friend till the moment you 're not .
that 's game theory .
even if it 's at everyone else 's expense .
leaving his family , and-@@ and the new identity .
always an agenda , right ?
he might initially think smaller evils are okay
but the dance of good and evil could become jum@@ bled ,
they 're going to kill me , you know .
but the monsters in there ,
you were responsible for killing the lights ,
maybe i can find another way .
give me a piece of that gum .
it 'll start the process .
we don 't make it back , he keeps it .
fine .
look what they 've done to it .
he 's only gotten more powerful
just give me a little something .
you should have thought about that
oh , allah . kan@@ iel ou@@ tis says it was a misunderstanding .
an honest man doesn 't try to escape .
i 'd have left you in solitary forever if it was up to me .
rebels .... .
son of a bitch .
the question is : is the shei@@ k even inside ?
they find us up here ,
gu@@ iet .
troublesome children .
but perhaps too modern for this country .
and my son ,
i went to visit him a few weeks ago .
a way i could help .
you agreed to help him .
the case is currently under investigation .
how could he just check himself out ? !
yeah , well , it 's not much of a reha@@ b center
my husband has been gone all night .
look , even if he did have a relapse . i 'm sure he 'll be back soon .
i slipped a few sed@@ atives in your tea last night
didn 't wanna find you spra@@ w@@ led out
fine . let me know what you do like for breakfast ,
and into the foreseeable future .
i 'm moving in .
but i 'm fine .
in the light of day . i feel absolutely ...
yeah , and i also got rid of all your knives , raz@@ ors ,
you can 't . i just thought it was ugly .
you will drive me absolutely crazy .
can you help me with my bag ?
mike , you 're supposed to be sleeping .
you know where . new york .
three weeks .
i 'm not moving to new york .
my plumbing business is here .
sco@@ tch . coming right up .
we have to prepare for the worst , ly@@ net@@ te .
no , no , listen to me .
what ?
because we 've been riding this emotional roller co@@ aster
so what ? everybody 's got a secret .
and our mechanic does crystal me@@ th .
the world is filled with ordinary people that do nasty things .
let 's get on with our lives .
it makes no sense for me to be depressed ,
he did . he absolutely did .
swee@@ tie , i don 't think he was shot with a sta@@ pler .
sorry for just dropping by without calling .
what 's wrong ?
but why kill someone else
none of it makes any sense .
none of them would commit a cold-@@ blo@@ o@@ ded murder .
what if someone else knows ?
what 'd you say ?
and don 't give me that look .
carlos went a.@@ w.@@ o.@@ l. from reha@@ b last night ,
you know ?
oh , thank god ! i was so worried !
you can tell me the truth . i won 't judge .
really ?
i would think you 'd be an emotional mess right about now .
see , here 's my problem .
you don 't have to believe me .
b@@ ree , you need to talk about this .
uh , excuse me . i took intr@@ o to psy@@ ch
they became my concern when i caught you
i can ' .
and by the way .
in fact , i don 't think you care about anyone at all ,
no ! not until i 'm convinced you are no longer

well , that 's when the news came in about detective v@@ ance ,
so who 's this person you assaulted ?
and she thinks those two little words ..
many years ago ,
but somehow , when i was alone in that hotel room ,
and now that i 've had time to think about it ..
hey ! look who 's here with a pizza and a dvd .
hey , thanks again for giving up your trip .
no problem .
she must be furious .
tom , i know women .
no , it 's weird , but , uh ,
well , i 'll give you an example .

but my mother gave me some ice chips ,
we 'll let you get back in there .

and as for that " special price " ole@@ g said he 'd give us ?
she must really like to cook outside .
no , i 'm looking for sophie .
look , this is a long way to go
i 'm not doing it for the free cap@@ pu@@ cc@@ ino machine .
you know , it 's a page out of shakespeare , and i 'm pu@@ ck .
am i the only one who 's read a book ?
i gotta go grab ' em .
okay , good . now we 've got the power on ,
holy mother of god !
max , caroline , your shift started three minutes ago .
what is wrong with her ?
you two still haven 't figured out this machine ?
i 'm good with this kind of stuff .
hey , han 's a man , according to recent lore .
okay , let 's see . here 's the steam one .
it burned my neck !
luckily you 're not taller .
that cap@@ pu@@ cc@@ ino machine might have just
i 'm sorry , ole@@ g . sophie 's moved on .
yeah , but not in your neighborhood .
she had the decency to do it on a sto@@ op in stat@@ en island .
we were going to travel the world together .
hey , what 's this area back there ?
i should check it out .
is ole@@ g in here ?
that delicious mix of man and butter .
oh , honey , i could 've told you that .
wait till you see what happens
i don 't work for you .
oh , i have to get this .
but we used to have the same machine
no , i am not working at star@@ bucks .
just for two hours .
tam@@ p it in , pack it down , turn it on .
honestly , all i heard was group head .
place the steam wand halfway in the pitcher
sy@@ ru@@ ps , pow@@ ders , wh@@ ipped cream is right here .
i think i can handle it . i went to wh@@ ar@@ ton .
that 's not what i said .
girl , you 're good at this .
i am good . i think i 'm getting the hang of this .
or ohio .
i 'll have a tall drip , extra hot .
i 'd say it 's pretty obvious .
why ?
chan@@ ia , please ?
it is safe here .
you got any food for him ?
and why were you trying to take out kan@@ iel ou@@ tis ?
you weren 't supposed to .
i 'll tell you everything you want to know .
ican have you prosecuted .
you 're not calling him junior , are you ?
he 's an amazing kid .
he was tightening his control over me ,
when i knew pose@@ id@@ on had gone rogue
he 's not gonna hurt mike .
if you remove his mask ,
that 's the point , no one knows him .
you play his game . you wear your own mask .
i 'll get to the states as soon as i can .
yeah ?
a naval alert just went out .
it was reported by the ship 's captain .
ran into a few bodies :
back in the good old days , when the mob really knew
interesting pattern to this wound .
well , it 's an l-@@ shaped wound , so , not a rock .
well , maybe there was a struggle at the edge of the water .
shirt 's torn .
so , calculated p@@ mi is four to seven hours .
guy 's out here in the middle of nowhere
and who was he with ?
found a bloody print on the inside of the box .
it 's all goat 's blood ?
but in the meantime , the print 's pretty good .
you got to see this .
you sure ?
see there ?
sorry . haven 't gotten that far yet .
well , maybe his neighbor 's got the rest of your billy goat .
you think he killed walter burns
i 'll run the print .
gas company 's drilling right in his lap .
no pri@@ ors . he 's been here for 40 years .
well , if his prints are on that box ,
i didn 't see any livestock .
no oil leak .
let 's see if mr. gib@@ son 's here .
we only want to understand what 's going on .
let me show you .
i don 't mean to insult your intelligence ,
the cu@@ ya@@ ho@@ ga , just outside of cleveland .
did you know they were both sick ?
have you seen your doctor recently ?
you can read about it in my article .
unfortunately , all my sources keep dying on me .
have you ever heard of " frac@@ king " ?
look it up .
very well .
good .
yeah .
i analyzed the sample we collected from mr. gib@@ son 's well .
i pulled the clinical autopsy reports
this is the analysis from the water found
so walter burns
we need to warn people .
a water sample from one well
what ?
then they pump millions of gallons of water , sand
so they 're drilling right through the aquifer in cable springs ,
the valve 's loose , about a quarter turn .
i think somebody set up our truc@@ ker co@@ dy trim@@ ble
trim@@ ble gets out to fix his tire ,
this wasn 't an accident .
and what looks like some hair .
i think we know what made walter burns ' head wound .
but what he got was a be@@ ret@@ ta to the head .
co@@ dy trim@@ ble drove walter 's body out to the hot springs .
right . so ...
that 's some serious company loyalty .
that 's it . case closed .
you 're going to let some corporate lawyers
you got your evidence . you got the bad guy .
well , we still need a water sample
because walter burns drowned in
killer 's dead .
well , leonard and penny are our best friends .
they said it 's the perfect gift .
you don 't ..
don 't be silly .
do you think when k@@ ry@@ p@@ to the super@@ dog is out flying ,
nobody 's gonna die
late , and with an attitude .
of course she thinks that .
well , what other career option do you have , caroline ?
no , wait , your shop didn 't last six months .
oh , i 'm already there . and now i 'm back .
and we have to tell them to stop
and now they 're not making noise .
it 's max and caroline .
hi . yeah , it 's not a good time .
and , obviously , i 'm bey@@ once .
look at all the single ladies .
jay z and i have a lot in common .
where should i put this ?
put it anywhere you want .
look , you two may be crazy in love ,
oh , come on . we 're not in love .
oh , no , you 're right .
is it really a reward if it comes from c@@ vs ?
or are all the lanes reserved ?
wait , you 've never been to ole@@ g 's apartment ?
you 'd be surprised by my apartment , sophie .
yeah , well , that sounds nice .
any advice or pills ?
and you didn 't use my college fund
but if that didn 't work ,
caroline will be at ole@@ g 's .
the last time i was st@@ oned
look at us , max ,
oh , it 's this way .
now , what movie should we watch ?
is there one where shre@@ k has cancer ?
what is caroline doing here ?
i am at ole@@ g 's .
you told him this was our apartment ?
i 'm not letting anyone leave
are we not smoking weed ?
i don 't know what his problem is .
why doesn 't he fire himself for missing puberty ?
she spent her morning dus@@ ting a strap@@ -on .
and now this pig is as cold as your family is gonna be
my dad does not like to be pork te@@ ased .
the attraction was immediate .
we dated for six months .
and then , he suddenly disappeared .
just some peanut shells on the floor
not to mention the fact that joe gets claire in the deal .

it 's also a useful object on which to record it .
i 'm in a senti@@ mental mood .
we have had a good run .
free sample , father ?
i 'd think twice about that .
you know the level of enchan@@ tment they are getting from that .
yeah .
ka@@ ul@@ der . it has been too long .
when they 're used on humans , it is . they 're mixing them in the cup@@ cakes .
notice this ?
max , you 're too smart to go down that road .
more than anyone in history , actually .
more than i scare you ?
the man who came to see me has an odor on his skin .
arsenic . anything else ?
the one who cursed dol@@ an ?
yet most of us aren 't like him , you know . we 're the same as you .
you 've got magic in your blood . magic that can do very bad things .
oh , yes .
yes , my bar !
but i 'm not blaming you for destroying my life or anything .
an observation on how you destroyed my life .
look , i don 't like it any more than you do ,
that we have green skin and like to wear poin@@ ty hats
but what if those women really were wit@@ ches ?
see , i remember thinking if it was me found guilty ,
hey , kid . i was afraid i was too late .
okay .
here .
thank you .
i thought my im@@ mortality was the way that she punished me .
i 'm afraid i bear some responsibility .
i 've seen what comes next .
the witch queen will cast another plague curse .
the witch prison .
waiting to exact revenge .
now i 'm right back where i started .
ka@@ ul@@ der ,
ka@@ ul@@ der .
but my enemies came to call it " hex@@ en@@ bane . "
our agreement depended on me keeping you safe .
if i get hurt now , i stay hurt . where would that leave you ?
who says that a witch can 't hunt wit@@ ches ?
ka@@ ul@@ der .
when the spell is done , the fly swarm will be released .
stay close .
my god !
the queen 's using their power to release the plague .
the chant .
but the witch queen 's linking their minds like a chain .
every chain has a weak link .
that 's right .
they won 't do it .
you trust them to keep that promise ?
then this is your future .
bul not me .
you , unfortunately , will not be alive to see that i am right .
i 'm sure she can survive 10 minutes on our balcony .
no . you had an understanding .
your mere presence gives me cause , my lady .
surely , a creature such as you
and if you were to return as my wife ?
you may consider it a compliment .
i have no wish to become your wife .
i would have expected nothing less .
is this normal
what 's wrong ?
i 'll tell them it was my choice .
i have to take you back .
if you ride you have a chance .
e does not deserve this .
i 'm perfectly all right .
senator ?
i would be grateful for your mercy .
the lady cassi@@ a has saved your life .
i do , senator .
that he made you feel alive ?
this is not your fault , cassi@@ a .
i thought that ,
the same look i saw in rome
now rome has followed us back to pom@@ pei
a terrible waste of good wine .
it is the gods .
perhaps .
tonight i saw the man who killed my whole family .
is that really what the audience will want to see ?
don 't you think they 'd rather see
stop .
titu@@ s will have your entire family hung from the city walls
cassi@@ a ...
your family will become my family ,
is that what you want ?
and if you reverse this decision ,
can your reputation bear such a weakness ?
i think the wedding shall be in rome .
vul@@ can speaks !
decrees that he is worthy to stand
where is she ?
where are you going ?
mil@@ o , this is madness !
the mountain is going to kill us all !
there 's none faster . and now i see why .
the harbor 's gone . we have to find another way .
it 's too far . we ' never make it on foot .
good , ' cause i 'm having a contest .

your father was a brave man , a good man .
drugs , petty crime , never had a job .
doesn 't explain why you gave up your hobbies .
your coach had you picked as olympic team material .
who 's to blame for you qu@@ itting the marines ?
because my mum went mental .
we ain 't got much choice , you get me ?
hell , man . you know me . money 's not my issue .
climate change research , lobbying ,
because the last time i checked ,
money won 't solve this .
so i spent the past two years trying to find the real solution .

no one panic . listen to me . stay calm .
she 's right . go , fucking go !

can 't you see that everything
val@@ e@@ tine 's at last saying something of note .
nobody can h@@ ack into this shit .
can 't you see that everything
gal@@ a@@ had is dead . hence , we have just drunk a toast to him .
valentine can send his signal to any of them , all of them ,
and that 's it
and we only drink it when we lose a king@@ sman .
and on this occasion , i think it 's acceptable for us ,
it was developed as part of reagan 's " star wars " project .
we 're gonna take out one of valentine 's satellites .
it 'll take him couple of hours to re@@ route it ,

i know you are , tom , and i know you love her .
why do you think i 'm willing to say to my college room@@ mates .
because i am your wife !
do i still come first with you ?
well ...
well , that 's a shame .
up right now and tell me not to go out with him .
all right .
it is really just dinner .

good boy . see you later !
school .
she 's not in the house and she 's away from your t@@ uli@@ ps .
yes , uncle bob .
you can keep it .
one day you 'll dream about me , won 't you , kitty ?
you 'll be my partners right , victor ?
because you have to have a partner for the science fair ,
i have lots of ideas !
it says no death rays . see ?
and wrong .
you 'd like to do the science fair and that 's great .
science fair baseball . science fair , baseball .
ho reason you can 't do both .
something 's wrong with my fish !

yes , ever since
spar@@ ky !
good night , boy .
no . that 's why it 's called an " experiment . "
as mayor of new holland ,
the man is a menace !
have you looked through this science book they 're using ?
when i was a kid , pluto was a great planet .
in fairness , he didn 't write the textbook .
your neighbor , of course .
thinks he 's great .
yes .
ladies , gentlemen .
is that right word , " ignorant " " ?
your country does not make enough scientist .
you should be a scientist , victor .
they like what science gives them , but not the questions , no .
actually , i have a question .
the first time , did you love your experiment ?
and the second time ?
then you changed the variables .
science is not good or bad , victor .
that is why you must always be careful
that fish you showed us , was it real ?
you brought an animal back from the dead ?
with lightning , and boom , and s@@ ss
shel@@ ley ?
spar@@ ky , it 's okay , boy . it 's just me .
i never want to lose you .
come on , boy .
victor ! i need your help .

the married man she 's been seeing .

does that sound like a marriage to you ?
all i know is , it was really nice to watch a ball game with mike again .

we take them to dinner , they admire the girls up close and personal ,

it 's ma@@ ver@@ icks . i mean , it 's real .
i 've seen it with my own eyes , it 's right up the coast .
deep brea@@ ths .
a wave like ma@@ ver@@ icks will hold you down for minutes at a time
in the dresser that you moved into the baby 's room .
look , um , i know that surfing is
but i need you to make me a promise .
that you 're not gonna put the rush of a 30-@@ foot drop
god , you 're a good man .
you got a 0 : 00 shift !
oh , no .
i 'm getting up !
go on , take it . you 're gonna need it more than me .

that 's understandable .
you have no business talking about my children .

she was online in four months .
she 's now up to 216 .
hey , ben , are you gonna wear a suit every day ?
you 've been through a lot .
how long do you think she 'll be mad at me for ?
i mean , i assume you talked to her , apologized ,
what did you do , send her a t@@ we@@ et ?
i , like , tex@@ ted her a billion times .
but it was like , a nice e-mail .
it feels great , actually . thank you .
well , i haven 't sat at a desk for a while .
no , i get it .
let me see what i can do .
and , honestly , i think he would run our business
oh , and ..
matt seems like a terrific guy .
sorry , didn 't mean to interrupt .
who ? the dad ?
if you can , try to pull this towards you ,
okay , so then put that on lightly .
you want a slice ?
cheers .
i saw him arrive . how 'd that go ?
until he called us ..
apparently , selling clothes makes us a " ch@@ ick site . "
i couldn 't agree more . i find that surprising .
i just knew , at the end of the day ,
see ? that 's what i mean .
mm . you have a favorite quote ?
" you 're never wrong to do the right thing . "
but i 'm pretty sure mark twain said it first .
uh , ge@@ ez . sam coo@@ ke , one of my all-time favor@@ ites .
oh , she was great , right ?
oh , yeah .

first of all , that was yesterday .
thank you .

you know she has a business degree from pen@@ n ?
i mean , i forgot , but i know .
that would be very nice .
it 's cool . i can handle it .
yeah , why is that ?
obviously .
we 're like your sister wives .
ex@@ ci@@ tin@@ 9 .
maybe .
anyway , the only thing is ,
when do you have to go ?
do you want to come ?
oh , that sounds awesome . um ...
i get to comb my hair with a fork ....
this is jul@@ es .
i mean , if you can 't zo@@ om in , you probably won 't buy .
oh , boy .
she doesn 't have an alarm , right ?
what if there 's , like , a password on the e-mail ? hmm ?
jul@@ es said she 'd buy her a new one , so it 's a win-win .
this is like an " oceans " movie .
his name is elli@@ ott g@@ ould .
thank you .
uh , you are ben aff@@ lec@@ k 's brother .
i think that 's kind of self-@@ explanatory .
thank you .
park on the street .
dam@@ on , aff@@ lec@@ k 's brother , you 're with me .
i have no idea . ben , listen to me .

so , bravo , good for her . right ?
not that that is a reason to stay together .
let 's take that one off your plate right now .
i happen to have space , okay ?
and to think i didn 't even want to hire you .
you 're facing a fire-@@ breathing dragon .
because you don 't have a girlfriend ?
do you really want that ?
it doesn 't matter .
what 's it thinking about now ?
um , ra@@ i , there 's someone i want you to meet .
okay , i 'm going to play it cool .
look at that . i have a date .
and now for dessert ...
b@@ am ! that 's what i 'm talking about !
i was thinking , " hey , did you hear the one about ... ?
oh , she 's here .

it took me a few days to work up the nerve
yeah .
i 'm talking to you first .

kai 's the best on the team .
does he drink or smoke ?
all the places in the world to put food ...
how do you people eat here ?
richard , you don 't have to do this .
for@@ giving me or
it 's called ... eating .
especially not from you .
i honestly worry for your entire gender sometimes .
we didn 't think he was gonna do it .
just start going crazy , and it goes in deeper , deeper .
and then it kind of pu@@ ffed up .
and according to this x-ray , this thing 's got spi@@ kes .
or that the fish could be poisonous .
i '@@ m-@@ a call the bar , see what kind of fish it was .
oh , yeah . write it down .
she told us not to do anything stupid .
you haven 't seen one , by chance , have you ?
ye@@ p . i don 't think it 's down here .
are you okay ?
it happens with , um ... anxiety .
the tube 's only a temporary fix . we need to open him up .
he doesn 't have a minute . the co@@ ils have failed .
tried it your way . now help me with mine .

the er 's just like , " hold my beer . "
he was feeling good and
except ... if he just didn 't swallow the fish , man .

good job , michael .
i 'm calling it . yours is dead .
she 's ... she kind of looks normal .

those kids were living like f@@ eral cats in a crack house .
i mean , sharon said she 's been clean for four months .
look at the way li@@ zzy 's looking at her .
we didn 't take her kids , el@@ lie .
so we went to the school and joined her in the cafeteria .

we 've been dealing with all of this shit !
i have played 150 games of candy land with lit@@ a .
someday in the way , way , way off , deep , deep , deep distant future .

thank you , penny .
so now i have to sit on the floor ? it 's my house .
that might be the dum@@ best thing you 've ever said .
i am not breaking up with her .

i mean , the lyrics are " oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , oh . "
little ec@@ centr@@ ic@@ ities ?

amy said she couldn 't come to thanksgiving dinner
amy , why would you tell your mother
all your action figures are on fire .
and amy never joins us for sunday din@@ ners

that 's another beautiful piece , sir .
what are we talking about here ?
it 's not frozen , it 's on hold . all right ?
no . common would be a week , maybe 10 days .
jesus , ab@@ by . it 's the federal government
yeah , i called . everything is fine .
he is on the job that he was hired to do .
it 's all good .
the auxiliary ballast tank system on the star@@ board side .
and that leads to the ventilation shaft under box two .
you 've got to stay strong
stop it now , dra@@ ke .
what made you want to spend your life in prison ?

a man i put away made a promise to me .
taking a man 's life is nothing
and i had to .. i wanted to
never forget them . you have a choice .
who do you know in c block ?
lock in on b@@ res@@ lin . yes , sir .
odd men out . me and you .
look who you 're walking with right now .
you and the toilet .
exactly . me too .
the night that fish goes into that hole ,
yeah , he probably tells you the less you know the better , right ?
he tells me everything .
now , we can go by ourselves . me and you .
maybe " wh@@ ore " is too strong .
why 'd she have to come here , anyway ?
excuse me , doctor .
but you go ahead . your job 's more important .
that 's just business .
i know .
take a couple of steps back , boy .
how you gonna survive , huh ?
they got computer phones , bo@@ ob@@ ies made of silic@@ one .
i don 't have to justify myself to you .
maybe i 'll just snap a few right now ..
hey , break it up down there !

t-@@ bag 's insurance policy ?
my guy 's gonna lock him up in a moving van for a couple of days until we 're in the clear .
fernando , loo@@ k.@@ my mom ,
and all i know is , i 'm really scared .
you won 't have to .
wait , wait .
oh , baby . i don 't know . i don 't know .
your hormone things are out of wh@@ ack . you 're not thinking straight .
i want you to listen to me .
i 'm gonna be out .
you keep on telling me that .
tell me you 're gonna wait .
you 're all i got left in the world , baby please .
but you 'll learn to love again , right ?
well , keep an eye on the tier for me , will you ?
i need to know the time .
because he 's arranging the plan@@ e.@@ why the sudden curiosity ?
the less you know , the better .
i have to go . i 'll meet you in pl .
you could get thrown in the shu for that .
i don 't know what ..
i don 't care . say it .
man , she 's wound up tight .
i won 't see another one of these in my lifetime .
you 're doing the flip ,
yes , sir .
do i ?
she 'll destroy their confidence .
oh , no , sir .
i mean , they 're your babies .
no , that 's the first thing you 've said
everything after that is ...
well , the doctors have planned and rehear@@ sed this for weeks .
kare@@ v , you rushed it . you 're like two steps ahead of me .
yours over mine , everything 's fine .
that 's how it works .
you pulled me out of a once-@@ in-@@ a-@@ lifetime surgery
spinal separation complete .
it 's been two weeks now .
i gotta go .
wait . hold on . what about complications ?
i 'll , uh , see if two does it .
this is good stuff .
there 's beauty in the basics .
step by step .
about 80 % of the tumor had been vapor@@ ized
i passed a brush through the scope to clear the field .
suction , ke@@ p@@ ner .
yang ?
s@@ ats dropped to 88 .
at that point , dr. web@@ ber exercised his judgment and stepped in .
you know , i would love to go back
you hus@@ h . no one 's interested in your life .
please ask me ab@@ ou@@ a spleen .
or a pancre@@ as . i 've got a very good view of it .
derek shepherd .
zero silk .
they 're separating the colon right now .
have they done the flip thing yet ?
um , i gotta get out@@ ta here .
um .. yeah . across the street .
he has a job .
that we accidentally got pregnant
of how long we 'll stay together
we love each other , and we wanted these babies .
including accepting the hospital 's charity ,
really . i-i just ...
looks like andi has the bulk of the blood supply to the colon .
flip 's coming up ,
i 'm a little nervous about it .
i just don 't want to screw this up .
and you 're not comfortable doing it with her ?
i get it . you don 't need to say another word .
no , that 's not what i meant .
you sure you can do this ?
so i proceeded with the laser endo@@ scopy
do you mind if i run out for a minute
i know . i can get out and make it back in that time .
he 's a nice man . you could do without me for half an hour .
he won 't bite .
you can run , but you can 't hide .
now why on earth do you want to rush it
b-@@ because my life is happening now ,
a-@@ and if that 's not what you want ,
okay . look at this face .
yeah , yeah , yeah , super cute .
bail@@ ey spent the last two hours
look , keep looking .
he 's been under too long .
is this really what you want on your record ?
check under the liver again .
dr. bail@@ ey , the sponge is on the bottom of your shoe .
what ...
why aren 't we getting any urine ?
he was the one who suggested the transplant .
you what ?
honest to god .
no , that 's not right .
it was easier than taking candy from a baby .
removing clamp .
we have urine .
good job .
so we cracked his chest
yeah , i can do this all day ,
i like tu@@ ck .
i like dinosaurs and transformers
i know you don 't come without tu@@ ck .
i know who you are .
nothing ?
one step at a time .
hmm . you were a monster .
