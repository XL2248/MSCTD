Ok@@ ay . I &apos;m confused .
You don &apos;t care if I go to Paris with Jane ,
I &apos;m sorry . I have to tell you something ,
I have to go .
I &apos;m an accessory to murder .
I think you &apos;ve helped enough .
Gab@@ y , please . I can &apos;t stand this anymore .
Can &apos;t we talk for a minute ?
To be honest ,
Wa@@ it . What do you mean ?
He called us down to the station and gri@@ lled US one by one .
Why didn &apos;t he call me down there ?
Good question , given this whole thing is about you .
What are you talking about ?
B@@ ree , he wants re@@ ven@@ ge . He wants to bring you down ,
Gab@@ y , please .
I will figure out a way to make things better .
don &apos;t talk .
Oh , my God ! You brought it .
Now before I give it to you ..
oh , well , that never works .
What I was going to say ..
They &apos;re my whole world . I have nothing else .
You have nothing else ?
That &apos;s a bad position to make a deal from .
Sorry .
H@@ ey , you remember that deal I wanted to make with you ?
But at least he &apos;s honest about it .
No . I wo@@ und up taking a different angle on the investigation .
Actually , you were the reason for that .
Me ? What do you mean ?
Do you remember when we were talking about this guy ?
Y@@ ep .
That &apos;s the sau@@ ce my mother uses .
She likes cooking Italian because according to her ,
Inter@@ esting .
I &apos;ll have to have you over for sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti some night .
I &apos;m hung@@ ry now .
Oh . Um , ok@@ ay .
Why don &apos;t you give me an hour and come over ?
Will you cut up hot dogs into little ch@@ un@@ ks and mix them in with the sau@@ ce ?
I don &apos;t have hot dogs .
Oh , it &apos;s all right ; I do .
H@@ ey , where you been ?
I was talking with Penn@@ y .
What &apos;s wrong with you ?
You can &apos;t hang out with your ro@@ omm@@ ate &apos;s ex .
That &apos;s totally un@@ cool .
No , it &apos;s fine . I don &apos;t care .
I &apos;m over it .
Ye@@ ah , he &apos;s over it ; that &apos;s why he &apos;s been wh@@ ining all day
Is he making any progress ?
Cer@@ tain@@ ly .
It &apos;s not like I have to moderate my food intake
So , you guys want to do something ton@@ ight ?
N@@ ah , I can &apos;t . I got to pick up my mo@@ m from her water aer@@ ob@@ ics class .
18 over@@ weight women fl@@ apping their arm fat in a swimming pool .
L@@ ooks like the man@@ at@@ ee tank at Sea World .
For an hour and a half ?
How could you get lost ? Your phone has GPS .
Satelli@@ tes are down . Solar fl@@ ares .
There are no solar fl@@ ares right now .
Yes , there are .
What I meant to say was my battery died .
What the hell was that about ?
I don &apos;t know .
Do you think this is really Hill@@ ary Clinton doing it with Op@@ ra@@ h ?
Oh , we really need to get you a girl .
Leon@@ ard .
Oh , just come in !
Thanks for seeing me on such short notice .
What do you want , Shel@@ don ?
Maybe this isn &apos;t a good time .
Tell me why you wo@@ ke me up or I swe@@ ar to God I will kill you .
No , I don &apos;t want to do it . You can do it .
Ok@@ ay , you can take him for shoes .
I just took him for shoes .
Well , all I know is he says they hurt his feet .
Fine . I &apos;ll take him for shoes next Saturday .
You &apos;re taking him to Dis@@ ne@@ yland ?
Well , he heard me making plans on the phone ..
Was I going to say &quot; no &quot; ?
All right .
But let me know if you &apos;re going to stuff him with j@@ unk food .
I don &apos;t want to bring home a nice dinner for him and see it go to waste .
We &apos;re going to Dis@@ ne@@ yland .
The cards seem completely out of order and random ,
And the more cards you see ..
you get a sense of how everything fits together .
They &apos;re taking us home tomorrow on a plane .
And I said no planes , but we don &apos;t have a choice ,
Sorry . My bad &quot; ?
How are we doing here ?
H@@ ey , Jackson , you &apos;re talking to Slo@@ an , right ?
Ke@@ eping him updated .
Ye@@ ah . Not about work stuff , though .
He doesn &apos;t need that kind of pressure right now .
What is wrong with you two ?
Arizona &apos;s not gon@@ na lose her leg ,
They &apos;re coming back .
So let &apos;s act like it .
They &apos;re gon@@ na be fine .
We &apos;re all going to be fine .
How long are we saying that this is ok@@ ay ?
As long as she needs .
I , for one , find it refres@@ hing .
They say , if you don &apos;t have something nice to say ...
She never has anything nice to say .
Come on , Yang . I &apos;m wide open . Just hit me .
I said no more dam@@ n re@@ stra@@ ints !
Look , she is clearly a danger .
She doesn &apos;t even belong on this floor .
Look , there is nothing physically wrong with her .
She belongs up in p@@ sy@@ ch .
I am the chief of surgery and her husband .
Don &apos;t tell me where she belongs .
Well , with all due respect , si@@ r ,
Ok@@ ay .
Ok@@ ay . It &apos;s time .
It &apos;s time to get up .
They are gon@@ na take you up@@ stairs
And you &apos;re gon@@ na go sl@@ ack@@ -@@ j@@ aw@@ ed and cu@@ ck@@ oo &apos;s nest .
And you &apos;ll never be you again .
Crist@@ ina , please , I am beg@@ ging you . Please .
You have to say something .
Crist@@ ina , please .
Do you hear me ?
S@@ ay something , please .
1 , &apos; 1@@ EF
The tum@@ or can rec@@ ur too easily .
You need to dis@@ s@@ ect the two dra@@ ining v@@ eins clear
You get it all , she &apos;s cu@@ red .
Well , that &apos;s much sex@@ ier , isn &apos;t it ?
That &apos;s why we keep him around .
Thanks , Sh@@ ep@@ herd . I &apos;d be happy to have you join me ..
or if you &apos;d like to observe .
I , um ... probably have a class to teach .
Good luck .
She &apos;s right .
You &apos;re in@@ valuable .
Great .
Oh , h@@ ey . Dr. Sh@@ ep@@ herd . This is pretty cool .
Oh , is that so ?
Ye@@ ah . She just fre@@ ed the first dra@@ ining v@@ ein .
Ye@@ ah , I got it , Ros@@ s . Thanks .
There &apos;s ble@@ eding on the sin@@ us .
Su@@ ction .
Sur@@ vi@@ ve what ? Crist@@ ina , this is life .
Bad things happen . It &apos;s hard .
You find your people ,
Oh , god love you , M@@ er .
You know , so many hor@@ ri@@ ble things have happened to you ,
Go to Harvard ,
H@@ ey , your mother died here . Your husband was shot here .
George died here .
It &apos;s my life , and you were here for it , too .
I mean , now you sound like the same sc@@ ary lon@@ er b@@ itch
Like the past five years has never happened ?
Well , you know , a part of me wishes it h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t .
Oh , ok@@ ay . Well , then you should just go then .
And you should not look back . Go .
Mer@@ edi@@ th ..
No , you know , Crist@@ ina , you &apos;re right . I &apos;m not your person .
And ow@@ en isn &apos;t your person .
Your person is you , and it always has been .
What the hell did they do to this guy out there ?
H@@ old my hand .
I just feel like we &apos;re losing him , Der@@ ek .
Usually when I talk to him , I sense that he &apos;s there ,
I &apos;m so sc@@ ared ,
That &apos;s not gon@@ na happen ton@@ ight .
Pro@@ mis@@ e ?
If he starts going south , I &apos;ll tell him to cut it out .
He &apos;ll do whatever I say .
Thank you .
You heard what I told her .
Don &apos;t make me look like an ass .
P@@ ull it together .
A lot of people counting on you .
Dam@@ n it . I knew I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have gone home .
Is he ok@@ ay ? Did he code ?
Just come see .
Oh , god . Where the hell is Sh@@ ep@@ herd ?
A@@ very , tell me what &apos;s going on .
Tor@@ res .
Where you been ?
Pre@@ t@@ ty amazing recovery , right ?
Ye@@ ah , his SAT@@ s are good
Ye@@ ah , B.@@ P. is 110 over 60 .
And he &apos;s making in@@ appropriate sexual comments to Broo@@ ks .
It &apos;s fine .
No , I still think that &apos;s wei@@ rd .
Well , I know you do , but you &apos;re wrong .
You tell her she &apos;s beautiful just the way she is
And that is definitely not how I talk to patient .
No , but it &apos;s how you talk to a woman , A@@ very .
We &apos;re in the business
Again , sometimes when you talk ,
She &apos;s a person on the precip@@ ice of change , A@@ very .
She &apos;s sc@@ ared and she &apos;s wor@@ ried .
God , the things we worry about .
So point@@ less .
And we get to help take that worry away .
It &apos;s why we &apos;re doctors .
It &apos;s actually why we &apos;re people ,
And whether we walk away leaving them better
We control that , A@@ very
If you love someone ,
I had that thought a lot , too .
And I didn &apos;t like myself for it ,
I kept thinking about my wife and baby ,
I only went on that plane because I was p@@ is@@ sed at you .
So I kept wondering ...
I &apos;m only here because he &apos;s so sel@@ fish and thou@@ ght@@ less .
And no matter how hard I tried to make him better ,
So now ...
I keep wondering ..
Why this would happen to someone like me ,
So I gu@@ ess I &apos;m still pretty p@@ is@@ sed off .
Would you get out of my room ,
H@@ ey . Look who &apos;s here .
H@@ ey . We just had lunch ,
B@@ ye , baby . I &apos;ll see you ton@@ ight .
You need to take her to the park more .
She goes from that apartment to the day care .
She &apos;s in@@ doors all day .
Ok@@ ay .
Why the fu@@ ck would I do that ?
What do they want ?
Two and a half million dollars , un@@ marked .
Oc@@ ta@@ via gallery by 1 : 00 P.@@ M. Or they cut her open .
Can your team pre@@ p by 1 : 00 ?
It &apos;ll be tight . It &apos;s lun@@ ch@@ time .
There &apos;s lots of ex@@ its .
We can expect heavy foot traffic .
We &apos;ll have s@@ ni@@ pers cover the exterior .
S@@ ni@@ pers ? We don &apos;t need s@@ ni@@ pers . I &apos;ve got the cash .
I &apos;m right behind you .
You tail@@ ing him ?
Ye@@ ah , I &apos;ve got eyes on him .
Do not turn around .
Do not acknowledge that you can hear me .
Wa@@ it for them to approach you , Mr. D@@ enn@@ ing .
You have him ? He &apos;s out of my line of sight , Jane .
I don &apos;t want to say something that I &apos;m gon@@ na regre@@ t .
I don &apos;t even know
I feel really st@@ up@@ id . I just ..
Nothing is gon@@ na happen . We &apos;re just ..
We &apos;re just gon@@ na sit and talk . That &apos;s all .
I don &apos;t think so , Ben .
H@@ ey , what &apos;s going on ?
It &apos;s a disaster .
You know how I built my reputation ?
How did you build your reputation ?
Bre@@ aking down every cro@@ oked ban@@ ker
You know , I do the wrong thing for the right reasons
Who do you think you &apos;ll be without your reputation ?
Rep@@ utation , Mr. C@@ ah@@ ill , is an id@@ le impression ,
Ye@@ ah .
Can you handle it ?
I &apos;ll take care of my reputation .

You don &apos;t think she &apos;s ok@@ ay , do you ? &apos; cause I don &apos;t .
I mean , she was in the house this morning .
Did she spend the night ? Because she &apos;s married .
And you will stay by his side all day ...
Yes .
Even during lunch .
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ll be w@@ anting lunch .
Yes , yes , I will .
Fine . Go get Dr. Slo@@ an .
Dec@@ re@@ ased breath sounds on the right side .
I wasn &apos;t trying to hurt your feelings .
There &apos;s a few things I don &apos;t talk about ,
Um , so is there any chest pain
What &apos;s the chance of me finishing a thought today ?
Not great . Um , there &apos;s some compression ,
Dr@@ .@@ Yang , can you book an o.@@ R. , please ?
You &apos;ll be sc@@ rub@@ bing in .

Seri@@ ously , how often does a case like this come long ?
What the hell &apos;s the matter with you today ?
Nothing , I
What ?
Well , I thought I had some normal skin here ,
What does that mean ?
It means , Jer@@ ry &apos;s not going to get his skin gra@@ fts any@@ time soon .
He &apos;s gon@@ na have a lot of open wo@@ unds .
So he was right .
He is gon@@ na look like Frank@@ enstein .
Maybe I should go update the wife .
You know , prepare her for the worst ?
I like you more than I wanted to .
And , u@@ h ...
And I knew what this was .
I don &apos;t know what my problem is .
Well , I &apos;ve got a couple of thoughts about that .
I thought I was the one person that you weren &apos;t gon@@ na analyze .
Well , I &apos;m not entirely sure it requires a professional .
I mean , either I &apos;m wil@@ dly attractive ,
incredible magne@@ tism .
Or .. you , u@@ h ,
or only in town for a few weeks .
I &apos;m getting my fu@@ cking re@@ match !

I hate that tour guy too !
H@@ an , oh , my God !
It took us five years ,

Just to play devil &apos;s advoc@@ ate ,

Ex@@ ac@@ tly .
And I hate him because that tour never e@@ ats in here .

Until ten years from now when you &apos;re still single .
H@@ ey , everybody !
Well , it happened .

S@@ ophie , the phrase is &quot; race horse . &quot;
See , I got a whole b@@ unch of these things
Ye@@ ah , I have what the doctors call
It &apos;ll be nice not to throw myself down a flight of stairs
Oh , all right , well .
W@@ ish me luck , girls .
Oh , wait up , S@@ ophie !
I &apos;ll hold the stick under you while you ur@@ inate .
O@@ leg , you &apos;re gon@@ na make a great father .
Is it even possible for S@@ ophie to have a baby ?
I mean , didn &apos;t that window close around the same time
Well , we don &apos;t know how old she is .
S@@ ophie &apos;s ag@@ eless , like a unic@@ orn
Carol@@ ine , I found a city website
Why , what &apos;d he do to you ?
Oh , my God , those Ti@@ ff@@ any windows
Oh , oh , my God , I &apos;ll be right back .
Where are you going ?
Down to the city archives .
I need proof that those windows are leg@@ it .
If I &apos;m not back when it &apos;s our turn to speak ,
Just go on an on talking about nothing .
G@@ ot it . Pre@@ tend I &apos;m you .
But you would need a mi@@ racle to find that proof in time .
I just got my period .
Ei@@ ther that , or I &apos;ve been shot .
S@@ ophie can still have a baby !
See , mira@@ cles can happen !
The woman is right there .
And like I &apos;ve already said twice , Your Hon@@ or ,
She &apos;s still not back . Keep going .
Your Hon@@ or , I &apos;ve been working at that din@@ er
I think we &apos;ve heard everything this gentlemen
She was from Brooklyn !
I thought it was per@@ tin@@ ent , Your Hon@@ or .
No , I already ble@@ w this once .
Finally , you admit you ble@@ w something
O@@ leg , you go .
I can &apos;t . The judge knows me
You go .
No , nothing good ever happened to me in a cour@@ tro@@ om .
Every single time , they just gave me back to my mother .
I &apos;ll go .
Ye@@ ah , I &apos;ve got something to say .
You &apos;re a lady judge .
You &apos;re smart and sharp . I &apos;m gon@@ na cut you up .
G@@ im@@ me the keys and b@@ low .
Exc@@ use me .
H@@ ey !
Now , here &apos;s how we &apos;re going to do this .
That &apos;s not a very good plan .
Get in the car !
You &apos;re gon@@ na make me late .
And I hate being late .
I told you that wasn &apos;t a good plan .
You &apos;re late .
&apos;m 36 seconds late .
There &apos;s several degrees of early and only one degree of late .
The island is like a cemetery to me now .
Easy on the drama , D@@ ad , please .
Just promise me you won &apos;t stick me in the ground . H@@ mm ?
Your mother was a good Catholic and everything ,
You gon@@ na get that , Junior ?
I don &apos;t use the phone while I &apos;m driving .
It &apos;s a hard world to get a break in
Please call me .
She &apos;s gon@@ na come . Don &apos;t worry .
Can you believe these girls ?
This is how they show their appreci@@ ation .
By being late for an appointment .
don &apos;t forget the T@@ ali@@ ban .
I bet they like E@@ vian in Fall@@ u@@ jah .
Well , they don &apos;t really care for spar@@ kling water .
They do prefer the flat .
Ok@@ ay , D@@ ad .
Junior , I don &apos;t think you have one o@@ unce of wig@@ gle room
Oh , nothing
I don &apos;t ask , they don &apos;t tell
Oh , look , um , Miss Un@@ known is calling again .
And what would make you think that &quot; Un@@ known &quot; is a Miss ?
I &apos;m just gu@@ essing .
Hello ?
Is this the Transpor@@ ter ?
That depends who this is .
Hop@@ efully , your next employer .
I don &apos;t do business over the phone .
Tom@@ orrow then . 2 : 00 p.m. at the bar at the Maj@@ estic hotel .
How will I know who you are ?
I &apos;m a legitimate business@@ man , In@@ spec@@ tor .
I have a lot of people who work for me .
And I can &apos;t possibly account for all of them .
Of course not . Though what I can &apos;t quite figure
I thought you said this was an electrical accident .
That is what the hotel is saying
name would pres@@ um@@ ably mean nothing
You &apos;re a quick study .
Are there any other rules I need to know about ?
Once the deal is made , the deal never changes .
You change the deal , I drive away .
The deal is for one passenger .
You pick me up , drop me off
Any packages ?
Two .
Weight ?
104 kil@@ os in total .
Is that a problem ? I was told that you can transport anything
Let &apos;s not get ahead of ourselves .
It &apos;s me . He left . You can proceed
Is there a problem ?
No , it &apos;s just that it &apos;s a Ch@@ ateau Ch@@ eval Blanc from the 2005 vintage .
I know , it says so on the label .
But it &apos;s 200 euros
Ye@@ ah .
No . I &apos;m good , thanks .
Hello , Junior .
D@@ ad , I don &apos;t think I &apos;m going to be able to make dinner ton@@ ight .
Cou@@ ple of things I need to take care of .
I &apos;m sorry to hear that . I got us a really good bottle of wine .
Ye@@ ah , I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;ll just have to find someone else to share it with .
That sounds like a good plan .
So@@ unds like a perfect idea .
May I be of some assistance ?
Thank you .
Do you mind holding that ?
Of course .
Ex@@ pen@@ sive taste .
What ?
What &apos;s going on ?
Oh , you &apos;re asking questions now ?
No . I told you once I set the deal , the deal doesn &apos;t change .
And it has@@ n &apos;t . Here are my two lovely packages .
G@@ ina , 49 kil@@ os , Q@@ i@@ ao , 55 kil@@ os . 104 in all .
We should go .
You should go .
Out of the car . All of you . Now .
No one is getting out of the car , as@@ sh@@ ole . Now drive .
You think this is the first time someone &apos;s held a gun to my head ?
No , I don &apos;t .
But it &apos;s gon@@ na be the first time someone uses it .
Oh , she &apos;s a char@@ mer .
Anna , there &apos;s a co@@ p .
Ok@@ ay , we don &apos;t have time to talk about this anymore .
Just show it to him already .
Show me what ?
No good de@@ ed goes un@@ pun@@ ished .
Monaco Police . Vehic@@ le documents , please .
Win@@ dow !
What is it gon@@ na be , Frank ?
ower the window .
Get out of the vehicle !
As only Mr. Tur@@ gin is authorized .
But as you will see , I was co@@ erc@@ ed .
First girl took my keys .
With both sets , she could open the security box by herself
And who was on the security post ?
Vo@@ ila
There &apos;s one more thing
He picked the one girl up ,
The police found the car , what was left of it .
It was set fire to , but they were already gone .
You &apos;re ok@@ ay , D@@ ad ?
Well , I &apos;ve been su@@ cker pun@@ ched a lot in my time ,
Stop right there .
How many more of you are there ?
She &apos;s the last one .
B@@ he is Est@@ oni@@ an@@ . rom T@@ all@@ inn
Actually they &apos;ve got very , very good vo@@ d@@ ka .
That &apos;s great , D@@ ad .
If I were armed , you &apos;d know it by now .
What do you want ?
w@@ anna make a new deal .
Thanks , but I think I &apos;ll pass .
You haven &apos;t heard the terms yet .
This should be good .
They &apos;re really very simple .
We &apos;re going to pay someone a visit ,
That hur@@ ts my feelings .
I wouldn &apos;t do that if I were you . That tou@@ ches your skin ,
Head@@ aches , V@@ om@@ iting , conv@@ ul@@ sions ,
Sou@@ p to nuts , it will kill a man in 12 hours .
I should kill you right now . All of you .
You could do that , but you &apos;d be killing your father along with us .
You play ball , your father gets it .
You don &apos;t , he dies .
How do I know you &apos;re gon@@ na hold up your end of the bar@@ gain ?
Did I ever lie to you ?
Besides , you don &apos;t have much of a choice .
I got all the girls that most fit the description on the video .
They &apos;re all here ?
Well , you don &apos;t get to hear the Langu@@ e@@ do@@ c much these days
They love their O@@ ec@@ cit@@ an .
My parents are from the Bas@@ que Country
I know the Bas@@ ou@@ e country well .
How do you know it ?
Was a big aer@@ ospace industry tu@@ cked in all around there .
No , you make yourself comfortable .
Get und@@ res@@ sed
Three girls dres@@ sed the same to ro@@ b a bank so no one knows who &apos;s who .
Are you asking me or telling me ?
See , the thing I can &apos;t figure out is
In The Three Mus@@ k@@ ete@@ ers , there were really four .
One of us had to stay behind and look after dear old dad .
No . No , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s it .
You could have left him tied up in the boot .
Maybe we &apos;re sm@@ ar@@ ter than the Three Mus@@ k@@ ete@@ ers .
You &apos;re not that smart if you &apos;re calling him &quot; old &quot;
I hope the transfer code works .
We &apos;re gon@@ na find out . All right . Let &apos;s try .
Here we go .
Ok@@ ay , hold on .
Yes ! All good . Come on , let &apos;s go !
Let &apos;s get the hell out of here .
Sh@@ it .
Listen , there &apos;s been a complic@@ ation , son . We &apos;re tra@@ pped
Do you have any idea how to get us out of here ?
Are you towards the front wheel ?
No , no , it &apos;s the main cargo hat@@ ch .
Stop the plane ! I repeat , stop the plane !
Clim@@ b in the back
Ok@@ ay , I &apos;m going to count to five and you &apos;re going to jump .
What do you mean , jump ?
What ? No ! We can &apos;t jump !
Junior !
How bad is it ?
It &apos;s really bad !
Take the scar@@ f and put pressure on it !
It &apos;s not working , we need a doctor .
If we don &apos;t out@@ run these guys , we &apos;re gon@@ na need a bloo@@ dy good lawyer too .
Tower to Air Star 6@@ 69 , you are going to crash .
Do you copy ? 6@@ 69 , do you copy ?
I repeat , you are going to crash .
You need to stop the engine right now !
W@@ ake up !
If you hear me ,
It &apos;s the trigger on your right .
Ye@@ ah , y@@ e@@ ah , I see it .
Do it now !
It &apos;s just water in the vi@@ al .
There &apos;s nothing in his beer . We made it up .
So he &apos;s not gon@@ na die ?
Not from po@@ ison .
Be a dear and get me some ra@@ gs and water , would you ?
Look , the bul@@ let is still in there .
f we don &apos;t get it out and the ble@@ eding doesn &apos;t stop she is gon@@ na die .
All right , we &apos;ve wa@@ sted enough time getting here already .
We all agreed . No doctors .
No . No , we can &apos;t just let her die .
We knew it would be dangerous .
Ok@@ ay , no doctors . Let &apos;s help her ourselves .
Can you pass me that bottle , would you ?
D@@ ad , that &apos;s great , D@@ ad .
Can you get something to raise her leg up , please .
See if you can find some perf@@ ume ,
Ok@@ ay .
What do you want me to do with it ?
All right . Take the rod off one of those clothes ra@@ cks
What to do ? To do what
See how many co@@ b@@ web@@ s you can get on there .
It &apos;s not exactly the Cle@@ vel@@ and Clin@@ ic ,
Put some pressure on that , would you , Junior ?
You &apos;re ok@@ ay . Sh@@ h , you &apos;re ok@@ ay .
No one &apos;s dying today .
J@@ ook who &apos;s there
How did this happen ?
One second everything is fine , the next I wake up on the floor .
It &apos;s some kind of medical grade an@@ es@@ thetic .
They switched the tank for the fo@@ g machine .
One part I can &apos;t quite figure out though is
H@@ ey Bel@@ lick , this is M@@ ack in cell block .
We got some cons p@@ opping off .
Give &apos; em a sm@@ ack , throw &apos; em on the line and write &apos; em up .
If you can &apos;t handle it , don &apos;t cash your pay@@ check this week .
This is not a good time , Do@@ c .
I got a call a prison@@ er was suffering from heat ex@@ haus@@ tion
We got a b@@ unch of over@@ heated cons getting loud in A-@@ W@@ ing .
I don &apos;t bl@@ ame &apos; em . It &apos;s an oven in there
But you should go back to the in@@ fir@@ mary building .
When things calm down ,
I &apos;m just looking out for your best interests .
And I appreciate that .
But Officer Bel@@ lick , you and I both know that
and I &apos;m just looking out for your best interests .
Go right on in .
You w@@ anna protect your prison re@@ p ?
Or you w@@ anna get out of here ?
What the hell &apos;s going on in here ?
Well , these in@@ mates became bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ent and they refused to rack in .
You locked it down with in@@ mates still out of their cells ?
We can handle 20 out-@@ of-@@ control in@@ mates easier than 300 .
What do you call a piece of white tr@@ ash who couldn &apos;t pass the c@@ ops exam
A CO .
Get your hands off the f@@ ence .
Su@@ ck it , p@@ ig !
You know , T@@ eddy , You really let me down@@ .@@ And that &apos;s hard to do ,
That &apos;s right , T@@ eddy .
I read your p@@ sy@@ ch records .
I &apos;m gon@@ na kill you !
Hot as hell .
They &apos;ll wear themselves out eventually .
The call was a f@@ ake .
What about a stay of execution or ... : ?
No no It &apos;s legally in@@ sufficient .
What the hell does that mean ?
No@@ d your head if you believe me .
Good man .
The@@ o .
What can we do for you today ?
H@@ mm . This where it hur@@ ts ?
A little higher and to the left
Your kne@@ e &apos;s held together by a rod and three scre@@ ws .
I &apos;m saving ten@@ derness is normal . No more me@@ ds .
OK . K@@ w@@ ame , why are you back ?
In@@ mates in cell block have com@@ promised
A-@@ W@@ ing is sh@@ utting down .
It &apos;s p@@ opping off up in G Pop !
Some@@ where on the other side of this wall
If we can get through this wall , we can get into the pipe .
Look around You &apos;re not gon@@ na make it .
No blood needs to sp@@ ill , S@@ ink .
Then walk away .
We both know that ain &apos;t gon@@ na happen .
Ye@@ ah ?
That &apos;s one big p@@ ile of concrete .
How do you know where the pipe is ?
We &apos;ve got someone to show us where it is .
Oh , really ? Who ?
infection &apos;s not so bad .
but I &apos;m going to give you a shot of pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in just to make sure , ok@@ ay ?
This is R@@ iz@@ zo@@ .@@ Does anyone need back up , over ?
Neg@@ ative . A-@@ W@@ ing is ev@@ acu@@ ating and locked down .
Rem@@ ain in B-@@ W@@ ing .
What &apos;s up , Do@@ c ?
Come on , Do@@ c .
You don &apos;t w@@ anna do this .
We &apos;re sorry . This line is experiencing technical difficulties .
You ever see one of them saf@@ ari shows
Gu@@ ess which one you are .
T@@ ough little gor@@ illa , ain &apos;t he ?
I was raised to believe the devil &apos;s got some crazy power ,
We don &apos;t need a sle@@ d@@ geh@@ ammer .
What the hell am I supposed to do with this ?
S@@ ick Bay , please report .
R@@ iz@@ zo , is everything OK ?
All clear in S@@ ick Bay . Over .
Let the bul@@ ls worry about the noise .
We just need a few small holes .
How can we fit through small holes ?
E@@ ver hear of ten@@ si@@ le strength ?
Hoo@@ ke &apos;s Law of elas@@ tic@@ ity ?
What do you think ?
If we drill holes in strategic locations ,
How about speaking English ?
We &apos;ll be able to break through the part of the wall that covers the pi@@ p
We go in through the tip of each horn , the eyes ,
It makes a kind of X .
Let &apos;s get to it .
If I can get DI@@ R@@ T in there with some of the new@@ er fire@@ power ...
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah , so we can end the ri@@ ots today and start f@@ uner@@ als tomorrow ?
I calculated the drill point coordinates ,
Everything &apos;s been worked out so the image hits the right spot .
It &apos;s just mat@@ h .
What if your mat@@ h is wrong ?
You &apos;ll drill into one of a do@@ zen gas lines behind the wall .
There &apos;ll be an explo@@ sion and we &apos;ll be burned alive .
But you &apos;re good at mat@@ h , right ?
They &apos;re breaking out .
I-@@ I don &apos;t know anything about show business ,
I think we &apos;re gon@@ na go .
Are you sure ?
We were making fun of failed care@@ ers .
We didn &apos;t get to tap the ju@@ icy v@@ ein that is Howard &apos;s .
H@@ ey , I work at the same university you do .
Why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband ?
Oh , I &apos;m sure he does it out of love .
The same way my boy@@ friend makes me feel terrible
I think we &apos;re gon@@ na go .
No , no , no . This is not a fight .
I-@@ I was just excited that someone offered you a part
Now it &apos;s a fight .
Well , with that sorted out ,
Howard started it .
I didn &apos;t do anything . I was just sitting here .
I wasn &apos;t referring to this evening .
Ten years ago , upon first seeing me ,
Is@@ n &apos;t it a little late to get plane ti@@ ck ...
.. plane tickets ? Ye@@ ah .
plane tickets ? Ye@@ ah .
Will you please st@@ o ..
.. Stop that ? Ok@@ ay .
I don &apos;t know what to do .
My car thre@@ w a rod and it &apos;s tot@@ aled .
I can &apos;t afford a new one , I have no job ,
I &apos;m so sorry .
I know it &apos;s a sensitive subject ,
I did . I called them . The part &apos;s gone .
They gave it to someone else .
Now that girl &apos;s gon@@ na get discovered and become famous
At least they talked about you on L@@ etter@@ man .
Come on , I can drive you wherever you need to go .
How ? Unlike me , you have a job .
I &apos;m just gon@@ na have to go back to being a wa@@ it@@ ress ..
.... like I will be for the rest of my life .
Leon@@ ard , would you wra@@ p it up ?
I &apos;m sorry , is the fact that my life &apos;s falling apart
It is .
You were wrong , friend Howard .
She completely understood .
Have you heard back from Em@@ ily ?
I have .
And I &apos;m afraid she doesn &apos;t think you &apos;re right for her .
Who was that ?
He &apos;s just an old customer of my dad &apos;s .
I didn &apos;t recognize him .
Ye@@ ah , he might bring his car in on Friday .
What &apos;s wrong with it ?
Our job to find out .
I was thinking about the race ton@@ ight . We should get there early .
Five cars , the race is full . Po@@ t should be , like , what ?
Never mind that .
While Mon@@ arch was talking about you , I had a vision .

You haven &apos;t driven it , D@@ ino . To@@ bey &apos;s had the keys the whole time .

We had a deal for you to get me S@@ cy@@ lla .
And you haven &apos;t gotten me that , have you ?
You gave me your word .
And I &apos;m giving you my word again , you will go ...
Back to prison if you can &apos;t get me those other five cards .
But if you &apos;re telling me you can &apos;t get this done .
Just let me know right now , and we &apos;ll get your cell ready .
You understand ?
I &apos;ll get it done .
There &apos;s one more thing .
You see anything we can use ?
No , and let me be crystal clear for you guys : I point and click .
That &apos;s it , other than that , I &apos;m off the clock .
Sh@@ ut up .
Wa@@ it a minute , where &apos;s his calendar ?
Dr. Fe@@ el@@ good &apos;s got it .
Here , Um , take a look at this .
This is today &apos;s date .
There &apos;s absolutely nothing on it but a star .
This whole thing was a mistake .
No , no , this wasn &apos;t a mistake .
Sco@@ field got us a card within 24 hours ...
Of being dropped in Los Angeles .
He knows what he &apos;s doing .
Look , I &apos;m willing to take the risk and do my job .
But he follows my recommendations , Don .
&quot; Sir , changed your late London arrival ..
Now 7 / 16 at 4 : 00 p.m. &quot;
There &apos;s nothing about London in his calendar , is there ?
Not that we &apos;ve seen , no .
Nothing about travel to or from the UK at all ?
No , nothing .
Now , why would he get an e-mail about an arrival in London ..
When he has no business scheduled there ?
It &apos;s probably because the e-mail is a ..
Code .
Alex , I &apos;m so glad you joined US .
S-@@ C-@@ Y-@@ L-@@ L-@@ A , S@@ cy@@ lla
A meeting with himself , so that ..
Is where we &apos;re going to find our next card@@ holder .
Ok@@ ay , so 4 : 00 p.m. is our when , we need a where .
If you were having a secret meeting .
You wouldn &apos;t send all the information together .
You &apos;d send the where and the when separately as a prec@@ au@@ tion .
At the same time as the London e-mail ?
Within a few seconds of the London mail .
Two more e-@@ mails followed from the same IP path .
But that &apos;s when my device ran out of hard drive space .
It picked up the IP address , but not the content .
Tra@@ ce the IP address and find out who sent these e-@@ mails .
Oh , look , e-@@ mails get bo@@ unc@@ ed to rou@@ ters all over the world .
Before they end in your in@@ box .
Wher@@ ever the mail &apos;s been , it leaves a shadow file .
Prob@@ ably squ@@ at@@ ted at the An@@ ah@@ eim server cluster ..
A nan@@ os@@ ec@@ ond before reaching Tu@@ x@@ horn .
So that &apos;s where you &apos;re going to find your shadow file .
So get it .
Not every ge@@ ek with a Commod@@ ore 64 can h@@ ack into NASA .
I mean , these servers ..
Have more fire@@ walls than the devil &apos;s bedroom .
You want those e-@@ mails , I &apos;m sorry .
It &apos;s on a main server in An@@ ah@@ eim .
Is this possible to find those e-@@ mails at that server ?
I know what you &apos;re planning , Alex .
But listen to me .
If you do track him down , call me .
Don &apos;t do something that could get you hurt .
I won &apos;t .
So the material will be where you asked by 5 : 00 p.@@ m .
And Alex , I &apos;m so sorry .
Goo@@ d-@@ b@@ ye , Lang .
I &apos;m sorry , they can &apos;t see you today .
And there &apos;s nothing more I can do .
Ok@@ ay .
Thank you for your help , I appreciate it .
What was the name of the tem@@ p agency that sent you ?
U@@ h , maybe we can ...
Well , clearly it does . W@@ ha-@@ W@@ ha-@@ What &apos;s it do ?
To kill the fire , it su@@ cks all the oxygen out of this room .

Try again .
Look , I &apos;ve tried a stop route , a jo@@ ck program .
Even a back@@ -@@ door entry , I mean , you were in prison .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re familiar with that one .
You want to stop breathing ?
What happened ?
They locked me out .
I &apos;m telling you , they &apos;re sh@@ utting US down .
Looking forward to it .
Why the hell did you tell Sel@@ f ..
That we could get a card@@ holder by today ?
He set the terms , Alex !
I didn &apos;t have a choice !
And now none of us have a choice .
And I am not going back to prison .
And I still have this that I need ...
B@@ other me ? What are you talking about , son ?
I &apos;m just thri@@ lled to finally be able ...
I &apos;m going to be able to put a face to the voice .
Right , because we haven &apos;t met yet .

Thanks a lot . I appreciate it .
Look , man , we both have worn the bad@@ ge in our day .
It was a meeting between all six card@@ holders .
So now we know who has the other five cards .
And that should mean something .
Even to someone whose word means nothing .
I &apos;m gon@@ na call sen@@ ator Dall@@ o now .
But he follows my recommendations , Don .
The next Time you run from me .

Now , I know that from your file ,
He &apos;s not the one , is he ?
On the .. On the boat .
When you said that , there was one who didn &apos;t ..
It was a long time ago .
I still think he &apos;s an idi@@ ot , by the way .
I haven &apos;t mentioned him in my report . There &apos;s no need to , is there ?
The police are here ! It &apos;s some sort of inspection .
Who has the key to this lo@@ cker ? Open it , please !

You were issued a private investig@@ ator &apos;s license for your 18th birthday ?
He@@ h . Is that something California kids do ?
My dad is a P@@ l . I worked for him .
It was more ans@@ wering phones and handling his travel than anything else .
Re@@ ally ? Before you were 20 , your name p@@ opp@@ ed up on L@@ exis@@ N@@ ex@@ is in 14 .
Fif@@ teen .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff , are you aware of the video ..
of Log@@ an E@@ ch@@ oll@@ s threat@@ ening Bon@@ nie ?
Get out . You &apos;re not welcome here
Kind of speaks for itself .
Can you speak to the trage@@ dy ...
the violent death of a celebr@@ ity who seemed to have it all ?
So , what &apos;s new with you ?
I need your help , Ver@@ on@@ ica .
I don &apos;t really do that anymore .
Look , can you just hear me out ?
He &apos;s being bom@@ bar@@ ded by law@@ yers w@@ anting to represent him .

Well , if it isn &apos;t the man , the my@@ th , the legendary pain@@ -in-@@ the-@@ ass K@@ eit@@ h Mars .
Deputy .
You catch any hus@@ bands l@@ ately with their p@@ ants down ?
You should get a slide proj@@ ector and bring it down to the station .
We &apos;d love to see your di@@ rt@@ y-@@ picture collection .
Well , you boys are so busy cleaning up the town , how will you find the time ?
Don &apos;t know yet . But I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll figure something out .
I gu@@ ess you probably let a lot of things slide on your watch .
Those days are gone now .
You know what happens when you m@@ ess with the b@@ ull , right ?
You get the c@@ liches ?
Ly@@ les !
Look what we got here !
She was
And I wasn &apos;t a boy@@ friend .
Not really .
You know , I was something closer to a spon@@ sor .
That &apos;s a funny thought , isn &apos;t it ? Me as a stabili@@ zing influence .
You &apos;re gon@@ na get through this .
Am I ?
Oh , I gu@@ ess it has been a char@@ med life .
Take care of yourself , Ver@@ on@@ ica .
As far as I can see it &apos;s no big deal . Am I missing something ?
You really want to ask that question ?
We &apos;re gon@@ na move on . We have a Bon@@ nie De Vil@@ le update .
The star &apos;s family is p@@ is@@ sed off because Log@@ an E@@ ch@@ oll@@ s
Well , the fact is , I mean , Con@@ rad Mur@@ ray walked the streets for months .
So you &apos;re saying you think Log@@ an E@@ ch@@ oll@@ s did it .
I &apos;m saying that I wouldn &apos;t want to be in Log@@ an E@@ ch@@ oll@@ s &apos; shoes .
Can you name a single person who thinks that k@@ id is innocent ?
I can name one .
So , what are you gon@@ na do about it , Ver@@ on@@ ica ?
Re@@ ady to head down to the Bat@@ cave ?
&quot; Access@@ ori@@ es@@ &apos;
Would lab@@ eling it &quot; P@@ and@@ ora &quot; have seemed a little , what , I don &apos;t know .
oper@@ atic ?
Hav@@ en &apos;t you spent nine years figur@@ ing out exactly who you are ?
Has@@ n &apos;t your life been better since giving this up ?
Get@@ ting out of N@@ ept@@ une ?
D@@ ick saw a t@@ we@@ et that night saying Car@@ rie was showing up at the 09@@ er .
saying , &quot; You sure that &apos;s a good idea ? &quot;
Later , she texts saying she &apos;s having a moment of weak@@ ness and needed my help .
So like any good spon@@ sor , you go ?
Am I doing this now ?
T@@ ine
Everyone knew her code , but this time it didn &apos;t work .
Car@@ rie ?
Now , the alarm goes off .
Then the phone starts ring@@ ing .
I knew it was the guard gate ..
Car@@ rie !
But I didn &apos;t know the code word .
She &apos;s not in her bedroom .
Then I see her bathroom door &apos;s open .
U@@ h , y@@ e@@ ah . I just got a call from my mo@@ ther@@ -in-@@ law
Well , is your mo@@ ther@@ -in-@@ law in N@@ ept@@ une ?
Because our location sc@@ outs are in N@@ ept@@ une today .

Cli@@ ff@@ ord
Come on . I learned that way before law school
You probably also know , then , that convic@@ ted fel@@ ons don &apos;t take the bar exam .
Sorry if I don &apos;t think you b@@ lowing up your life is a jo@@ ke .
This is who you picked up ?
Oh , my God . Hil@@ ari@@ ous , girlfriend .
I know , girlfriend . Is@@ n &apos;t it ?
This one is always playing p@@ ranks on me .
She &apos;s good . It &apos;s like George Clo@@ on@@ ey and his friends .
Everything in my life has led to this moment .
Did she need to be here ?
I &apos;m the designated driver . That &apos;s the deal .
E@@ ven@@ ing , miss . &quot; Just give me a sec to adjust .
I forgot my pan@@ ties .
So this is happening
I &apos;ve let her draw hearts on my upper th@@ ig@@ h for the last 10 minutes .
So , y@@ e@@ ah , I get the st@@ akes .
H@@ ey , Log@@ an , is that your new girlfriend ?

I would feel pretty great about that actually . Thank you .
We need you to start Monday . Is that a problem ?
Where &apos;s your date ?
She got them to play a Bon@@ nie single .
A@@ wake and away we go
you are not on a date with a mur@@ derer .
I do take some comfort in that . How do you know ?
Bo@@ unc@@ er confirmed it .
performed Me@@ de@@ a when the news broke .
So where do we go from here ?
Which one of these goes over better ?
&quot; D@@ ad , I &apos;m mar@@ rying a lawyer .. &quot;
or &quot; D@@ ad , I &apos;m mar@@ rying a private dick &quot;
But what &apos;s the difference between a por@@ c@@ up@@ ine and law@@ yers in a Porsche ?
On a por@@ c@@ up@@ ine
And a h@@ ow@@ d@@ y-@@ do to you .
What &apos;s up , V ?
Wo@@ w , you guys look good .
You &apos;ve been to M@@ ama Le@@ one &apos;s before , right ?
H@@ ey , I &apos;ve got something to show you .
Look , this is from the talent show our senior year .
The video year@@ book advisor let me see it .
That one is Car@@ rie Bishop . I don &apos;t know who this other girl is .
It &apos;s Sus@@ an K@@ night . Car@@ rie &apos;s best friend .
Also dead , stran@@ gely enough . Bo@@ ating accident ..
the year I left for Stan@@ ford . Why are you showing me this ?
You@@ l &apos;ll see
Come again ?
Ign@@ ore the dick .
Check this out .
Talent show the year after we graduated .
Then when people bo@@ o ..
I &apos;m gon@@ na burn this place down !
They didn &apos;t let her come back to school .
She had to take all her fin@@ als as tak@@ e-@@ home tests
Um , actually ...
When Number One Dau@@ ghter was young ..
her skills were sharp like blade of sword
Is that so ?
I knew you &apos;d be here .
Tell the truth , you &apos;ve been sitting there since gradu@@ ation , haven &apos;t you ?
Don &apos;t worry about her .
They really should have a bar right by the entrance
Oh , look who it is !
And I haven &apos;t been on my bike since Valent@@ ina was born .
To remember those of us who are no longer around ...
Well , I &apos;ll be dam@@ ned .
Please turn your attention to the screen ..
as we say good@@ b@@ ye to old friends .
Shel@@ ly .
Some people just call it tex@@ ting .
I w@@ anna ask you about the night Sus@@ an K@@ night died .
He@@ h . Of course you do . It &apos;s a party .
The mem@@ orial video got me thinking . I &apos;ve never really heard what happened .
I have told this story about 10 z@@ illion times , but ok@@ ay .
We were part@@ ying on Car@@ rie &apos;s dad &apos;s boat
it &apos;s pretty bor@@ ing part@@ ying on a boat after about 15 minutes .
fre@@ aking out because they can &apos;t find Sus@@ an .
Ri@@ pped the boat apart looking for her .
but she was g@@ one-@@ Z@@ 0 .
Last time I saw Sus@@ an , she was b@@ lowing ch@@ un@@ ks over the side of the boat .
She must &apos;ve sli@@ pped and fell off
What a night@@ m@@ are .
I can &apos;t imagine .
M@@ ust have been aw@@ ful when you figured out she was missing .
I had to go to therapy for post-@@ traum@@ atic stress .
I still can &apos;t go on a boat .
You already have a job . It &apos;s in New York .
Z@@ ou did it , k@@ id . You made it out .
Don &apos;t let this town take you down like it does everyone else .
Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t take you down .
Well , love is blind
I could still get you the names of the F@@ CH@@ ers .
I have someone in the sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s department ..
who might help me if he can work up the ner@@ ve .
The ner@@ ve ? The sh@@ eri@@ ff &apos;s department is a jo@@ ke .
It &apos;s been a giant c@@ lown car since you left office .
They &apos;re dangerous , Ver@@ on@@ ica .
C@@ ops with swimming pools and sports cars ? They &apos;ve got a good thing going .
I want you to stay away from them .
Ye@@ ah , ok@@ ay .
Well , that &apos;s not that bad .
Penn@@ y flo@@ ats in and out of frame in a few of the videos
Or I could just play her in drag . H@@ ey , Penn@@ y , give me your glasses .
H@@ ey . So you &apos;re interested in hi@@ dden@@ -@@ camera celebr@@ ity foot@@ age .
If you &apos;ve got the cash , I &apos;ve got some hidden video I know you &apos;ll want to see .
Me@@ et me at the Santa Mon@@ ica P@@ ier in one hour by the dancing gor@@ illa .
Good job , F@@ en .
Mon@@ key &apos;s following you . H@@ a , ha !
Of course .
Do you work for tips ?
Here &apos;s a tip . Change pro@@ fes@@ sions .
Vincent Van Low@@ e . N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s sec@@ ond-@@ best PI but forem@@ ost ass@@ -@@ hat .
I need everything you got off Bon@@ nie De@@ Vil@@ le &apos;s tablet .
Oh . I know not of what you speak .
I am just a resp@@ ec@@ table business@@ man trying to earn an honest dollar .
Give it to me , V@@ inn@@ ie .
Or I &apos;ll tell 50 C@@ ent &apos;s security team where they can find the guy ...
who posted video of F@@ id@@ dy b@@ aking lem@@ on cake ...
while singing &quot; After@@ noon Del@@ ight . &quot;
You should be happy for me , V-@@ Mars . I found my calling
Do you have any idea what People will pay ..
for a shot of a celebr@@ ity looking st@@ up@@ id while eating ? A lot .
T do the circuit .
I do the ch@@ i-@@ chi stores and I do the Tren@@ ch pres@@ cho@@ ols .
If you have more than five IM@@ D@@ b credits .
without me finding out a way to get paid .
H@@ a , ha . I &apos;m the reason people know Anne Ha@@ th@@ away has a vag@@ ina .
Before that , they thought , y@@ e@@ ah , maybe , but they didn &apos;t know
Any@@ way , you &apos;ll like this . I stu@@ ff@@ ed 30 tablets into those M@@ TV gift bags .
You w@@ anna know my return on investment ? N@@ ope . No , I don &apos;t .
You &apos;re legal now , right ?
We should go out some@@ time
I &apos;m ass@@ um@@ ing it &apos;s a signed con@@ fession .
ow was Car@@ rie &apos;s time of death determined ?
Quick@@ ly . Gu@@ ards at the security gate checked Log@@ an in at 1 : 15 a.@@ m .
arri@@ e &apos;s alarm went off at 1 : 21
Time of death some@@ time between 1 : 21 and 1 : 31
Gu@@ ards checked her out at 3 p.@@ m .
Many people , including Free Hu@@ gs over here , spoke to Car@@ rie after that .
We have phone records .
Car@@ rie was alive when G@@ ia left , but G@@ ia didn &apos;t go alone .
Her son@@ -@@ of-@@ a-@@ con@@ gres@@ sman fi@@ ance went with her .
Prob@@ ably in the tr@@ unk .
When G@@ ia left , she simply left a door or a window open for Luke .
He wa@@ ited for his opportunity .
He shows up at the 09@@ er , establishing a very public ali@@ bi .
were always fighting about her part@@ ying
I supp@@ ose they mur@@ dered her for k@@ icks .
I know how pain@@ fully bor@@ ing these rich kids &apos; lives are .
They mur@@ dered Car@@ rie because they were convinced she was cra@@ cking .
Some@@ thing terrible happened on Car@@ rie &apos;s dad &apos;s boat nine years ago .
Some@@ thing worth killing Car@@ rie to keep secret
No anch@@ or . They used it to wei@@ gh the body down .
Where &apos;d you get these official police photos ?
Maybe she &apos;s friends with Mart@@ ina Vas@@ cu@@ ez ?
that for@@ eman hands down a life sentence .
H@@ ey .
I don &apos;t care if Log@@ an ain &apos;t the guy .
America thinks he &apos;s guilty , and that &apos;s good enough for me .
Now get the hell out of my office .
H@@ ey .
I , u@@ h .. I believe the captain told you that the use of cell phones was prohibited .
Ye@@ ah , I gathered . I really w@@ anna be there with you .
There &apos;s just so much going on here right now .
I just ... I couldn &apos;t leave .
S@@ ure you could .
Ok@@ ay .
C@@ ould you maybe try and understand why I chose not to ?
I completely understand .
That &apos;s why I think it &apos;s time for u@@ S to just ..
Just walk away .
Wa@@ it , no , that &apos;s not what this is .
I mean , that &apos;s not what I want .
Ver@@ on@@ ica , I &apos;m standing outside of a hotel with my parents ..
who fle@@ w to New York mostly to meet you .
So that loyalty , or friendship
I wish that same feeling made you get on the plane today .
I got@@ ta go let my mo@@ m off the h@@ ook , ok@@ ay ?
She &apos;s concerned that her blow@@ out &apos;s gon@@ na fl@@ atten before you get here .
Log@@ an &apos;s coming over to talk about the case .
Please be nice .
What ? I &apos;m Over 21
Appar@@ ently , they left several on your cell but never heard back .
Ok@@ ay . I &apos;ll give them a call . Thanks .
No need . They said they &apos;re moving on without you .
They needed someone a little more &quot; motivated , &quot; I think it was . Or &quot; dedicated
The g@@ ist was they wanted someone who car@@ ed enough to return a call .
You worked so hard for so long ...
and just like that .
you &apos;re thro@@ wing it away ?
For what ?
This is K@@ eit@@ h
All right . B@@ ye .
I &apos;m gon@@ na .. I &apos;ll be right back .

a few weeks ago , K@@ eit@@ h . It &apos;s a funny video .
She immediately fre@@ aked out and called her partner in crime .
Have you seen Luke pick up ?
I can &apos;t actually see Luke right now .
Appar@@ ently , he had to make a pit stop for some hot man@@ -@@ on-@@ man action .
What are you talking about ?
What &apos;s he doing at . ? Oh .
H@@ old on . Some@@ one &apos;s at her door .
So I just got this call from this random number and ..
T@@ t &apos;s Cob@@ b
She called Cob@@ b for help .
Why ? Does she need someone to empty her cat box ?
You are protecting his bright future , right ?
I mean , there are be@@ ards and then there are be@@ ards that go the extra mile .
I was at the 09@@ er . There are witnesses . Every@@ body saw me .
G@@ ia , keep up .
We &apos;re past that now .
I believe you .
I even have proof you were there .
the baby that she gave up for adoption .
She dis@@ appears below deck .
Car@@ rie found her later and she was bar@@ ely breathing .
But Cob@@ b says that she &apos;d sleep it off
We were pic@@ turing j@@ ail time .

Even if it means dis@@ ap@@ pointing the one man I can &apos;t bear to dis@@ ap@@ point .
Now , you cut one down in Arizona , you can do a year in prison . Imag@@ ine that ?
Sh@@ it .
I know guys that ro@@ b people in here
How does it feel getting out ?
I haven &apos;t sle@@ pt in a few nights . But other than that ...
How you doing , Squ@@ e@@ eb ? How you feeling ?

Don &apos;t eat anything on the right side of the fridge . It belongs to Haw@@ k .
A@@ w , do you got any real food ?
I don &apos;t know , Henry . Take a wild gu@@ ess . Maybe water or milk or something .
If you put milk in it , you might as well use milk .
It &apos;s been confirmed that the victim is Boston Police Captain John Bo@@ yl@@ an .
U@@ no@@ ff@@ icial sources have described it as an exec@@ ution@@ -@@ style killing .
No ar@@ rests have been made .
Holy sh@@ it .
Thank you for that . There is a cit@@ y-@@ wide man@@ h@@ unt ...

U@@ h , my eyes were more on the girl .
U@@ h , they were two ,
Well , you &apos;re lucky you didn &apos;t end up like Am@@ ber .
To think the Top@@ per was in danger .
Ye@@ ah .
It &apos;s a sh@@ ame only the good die young , isn &apos;t it ?
I get , like , one phone call , don &apos;t I ?
You don &apos;t need a lawyer , Top@@ per .
I know , I need my public@@ ist .
I take it that &apos;s Greek ?
It &apos;s the clo@@ ak .
That and the sk@@ irt were my idea .

Right up here .

And if one of our Chicago boys gave her the money ,
The last cash deposit was for $ 1,@@ 200 .

If they don &apos;t stay normal about it ,
You know , I just watch TV , and it , like , ruins my days off .

Beck@@ y , I &apos;ve got the police here on the phone
What ?
They &apos;re saying you took it out of a woman &apos;s pur@@ se .
They don &apos;t open . There &apos;s nothing in them .
Not our standard k@@ ha@@ k@@ is .
Ye@@ ah , I know . I &apos;m sorry , but they were dirty . I didn &apos;t ...
Officer , I &apos;ve checked her po@@ ckets , and there &apos;s nothing in them ,
Ok@@ ay , good . U@@ h , does she have a pur@@ se ?
Do you have a pur@@ se ? You have a pur@@ se ?
I have ... I still have my pur@@ se .
Um , it wouldn &apos;t be here in the office .
It would be in the employee cub@@ ic@@ le area ,
Miss , be quiet .
There &apos;s no one ..
Now , had you seen this woman before on the premises ?
If you &apos;re just straight with me , it &apos;ll all be worked out , ok@@ ay ?

Ok@@ ay , good .
Now , first we need to find the money .
Now , do ... do you want to tell me where it is ?
I don &apos;t have any money .
You don &apos;t have any money ?
Well , why are there people who say otherwise ?
I don &apos;t know .
You don &apos;t know .

That &apos;s why it &apos;s important you take them to the car
If you do this , you will build our case . You understand ?
Yes .
We don &apos;t have no p@@ ickl@@ es either .
Sand@@ ra ! Are you or Mar@@ ti gon@@ na come help ?
I &apos;m on the register by myself .
Ok@@ ay , one of us will be right out .
Let me just finish this real quick .
Oh , my God .
Should I have my people start watching him ?
You think he could be wra@@ pped up in the same stuff Beck@@ y is ?
Oh , good@@ ness , no . No , no , no . Nothing like that , no .
But he gives you hell , hu@@ h ?
Ye@@ ah , he does , like you can &apos;t imagine .
H@@ a ha ! I &apos;m sorry . It must be a real pain .
Oh , h@@ ey , listen . Kevin said that you told him about Beck@@ y &apos;s brother
Oh , you know , I don &apos;t ... H@@ mm .
I don &apos;t think I said much , though , did I ?
You know , the last thing I need ... I may have mentioned it .
The last thing I need
You know what I mean ?
If you can &apos;t cooperate with me here ..
I &apos;m sorry .
I need to be able to trust you .
Right .
I &apos;m very sorry ..
That fall under sh@@ it that ain &apos;t none of my business .
Ye@@ ah , maybe you &apos;re right .
What &apos;s it look like from there , Ev@@ an ?
What &apos;s it like to have a fron@@ t-@@ row seat to the show ?
Come on .
How &apos;s everybody doing in here ?
Nothing .
What ?
We &apos;re just waiting . That &apos;s all .
W-@@ When are they coming ?
I don &apos;t know .
Well , let me talk to him , then .
Let me talk to him . Give me the phone .
Hello , Officer Dan@@ iel@@ s . How is it going ?
Oh , great . How you doing ? You busy out there ?
Ye@@ ah , I &apos;m busy as ever .
It &apos;s a great night . U@@ h ...

Oh , good . So I &apos;m gon@@ na give him back the phone .
So@@ unds good .
I &apos;ll see you when you come .
Ok@@ ay .
Sand@@ ra , please , I can &apos;t do this .
What are you ... What are you doing , honey ?
They can &apos;t make me do this .
Stop talking .
You &apos;re gon@@ na be fine .
Hello . This is Van .
H@@ ey , Van ...
sounds like Sand@@ ra &apos;s running around
I .. I gu@@ ess so .
Yes , I &apos;m sure it &apos;s busy in there .
Listen , I &apos;m not sure when you guys are coming .
Is Sand@@ ra still in there ?
She just left .
You have one minute left on this card .
What do you want me to do ?
Well , you got@@ ta get on that .
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
I need you to give her a span@@ king &apos; cause she was talking sm@@ ack to Sand@@ ra ,
You know ?
You mean ...
Can you tell her that ?
... actually do that ?
Can you put her on for me ?
He wants to talk to you .
I didn &apos;t do anything , si@@ r .
Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t we talk about you going easy on Sand@@ ra ?
That all this would be hard on her ? Did we not ?
Yes , si@@ r .
What about me , Re@@ bec@@ ca ?
Do you even understand how hard this is on me ?
You think I like situations like this ?
No . I don &apos;t . No@@ body does .
See ? Sh@@ ut up , Kevin .
Rob@@ bie ? H@@ ey , it &apos;s Sand@@ ra .
Sand@@ ra ? From the South End store ?
Yes , si@@ r . I &apos;m calling about that the@@ ft situation .
I &apos;m sorry . What happened ?
Um , my employee that st@@ ole .
The officer said you &apos;d been talking to him .
The police ? What happened ? I-@@ I &apos;ve been sick all day .
I &apos;ve got that thing going around .
You haven &apos;t been talking to Officer Dan@@ iel@@ s on the other line ?
I haven &apos;t talked to any@@ body today .
You &apos;re the first person I &apos;ve talked to .
Is everything ok@@ ay ?
Should . Should I come in ?
H@@ ey , you ok@@ ay ?
Who are you ?
Yes , I &apos;ll have an original Ch@@ ick@@ W@@ ich ,
H@@ a ! I &apos;m just kid@@ ding , Sand@@ ra . It &apos;s me .
Its Officer Dan@@ iel@@ s , mess@@ ing with ya .
Wa@@ it . He hung up ?
I was doing what I thought was the right thing .
I ... I did what I think , um , any@@ body would do ,
Take a girl &apos;s clothes away
Some@@ one who said they were the police .
Did you know that the police station was only a half-@@ mile away ?
Well , what he said was that he was investig@@ ating from her house .
And I asked him .
You know , &quot; When are you coming ? &quot; I asked many times .
And yet he never came , and that didn &apos;t make you suspicious ?
Um , y@@ e@@ ah , well ...
He had an answer every time that I asked a question .
And everything about it was strange to me ,
W@@ ere you bra@@ in@@ wash@@ ed ?
Private place .
Before you went to Japan , I saw you writing that story .
I didn &apos;t know you wrote stories
Well , so I bor@@ ro@@ wed M@@ um &apos;s key and went into your study ,
Just to where you stopped . It was a good part too .
A man comes to B@@ aker Su@@ ree
What thing would that be ?
&quot; The cane shows the marks of a dog &apos;s teeth .
The wood is from an island southwest o Mad@@ ei@@ r@@ g . &quot;
He we@@ ars a wedding ring ?
No . The clu@@ es are all on that page .
This sentence , to be exact .
&quot; One day , into the room came a young man ,
Not expensive clothes .
Then his wife must press them . Men don &apos;t have the talent
That &apos;s how you knew it was about the wife .
Well , no .
When you &apos;re a det@@ ective and a man comes to visit you ..
it &apos;s usually about his wife .
So why did you stop where you did ?
I prefer a c@@ ig@@ ar .
I told Wat@@ son , if I ever write a story myself ,
Did you write such a story ?
But I &apos;m trying to do so now .
I must finish with you before I die .
&quot; So you &apos;ve come about your wife . &quot;
Here .
I &apos;ll see you after lunch .
I &apos;m going to need some help with the be@@ es .
So you found the right address .
The ar@@ mon@@ ica ?
My father &apos;s most pri@@ zed possession .
He played it constantly till the day he died .
I had it brought to the house
One hour per week .
Soon Ann asked me if she could
Why are you here , Mr. Kel@@ mo@@ t ?
Mr. Hol@@ mes , my Ann has changed .
And it isn &apos;t just the lessons
One day I was outside the room
And I heard her saying , quite clearly .
Tr@@ ying to see if I can tell where I &apos;ve been .
Don &apos;t you know ?
Mr. Hol@@ mes can tell things like that
Where are you off to ?
See to the be@@ es !
You &apos;ll eat your breakfast first !
G@@ ot a letter from your a@@ unt the other day .
She says there &apos;s a couple in Por@@ ts@@ mouth
Need a hou@@ se@@ ke@@ eper .
Why would we want to live in Por@@ ts@@ mouth ?
Can &apos;t stay here forever .
Why not ?
You said you never wor@@ e one .
Well , yes , but it would &apos;ve pleased her .
She wanted the fic@@ tion@@ al@@ . ou are the real .
Well , I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s true .
I think I was real once until T@@ oh@@ n made me into fiction
Fla@@ y the part as he &apos;d fashi@@ oned it ,
I &apos;m actually quite f@@ ond of a pipe ,
So , Dr. Wat@@ son &apos;s imagination changed you ?
I &apos;ve never had much use for imagination .
I prefer facts .
My father would bring me here as a child .
It was designed as a mini@@ ature .
We walk as gi@@ ants .
The stones represent the lives of those he has lost .
Sher@@ lo@@ ck-@@ san !
Is this a met@@ aph@@ ysi@@ cal question ?
I mean , do you mo@@ ur@@ n them ?
Oh , I can &apos;t say that I &apos;ve ever mo@@ ur@@ ned the dead ,
Death , gri@@ ev@@ ing , mo@@ ur@@ ning
Lo@@ gic is rare , and so ...
I d@@ well on logic .
A few months ago , my brother My@@ cro@@ ft died .
His club , the Di@@ o@@ genes ,
I was given a small chest containing the Wat@@ son stories ,
They were as John always described them ,
But one of the titles pi@@ qu@@ ed my interest .
The story was familiar ,
But by a fortun@@ ate chance , an opportunity soon arose .
It &apos;s strange to see a sem@@ b@@ lance of one &apos;s self 40 feet high
Dear man , you should fear for your life .
Wh@@ atever do you mean ?
Mur@@ der , Mr. Kel@@ mo@@ t . Mur@@ der .
and played
Po@@ is@@ oned ?
With what means have T ?
But that night
All I knew for certain was that the case was my last
So , I decided to write the story down on paper
Get it right before I die .
You &apos;re not going to die
I &apos;m 93 .
I had a 6@@ re@@ at unc@@ le who lived to be 102
Well , I didn &apos;t actually know him .
I can &apos;t
M@@ um ! M@@ um !
Mr. Hol@@ mes !
Was it the smoke kno@@ cked him out ?
C@@ ould have done .
Most likely he stood up too quickly
He must have decided to take it sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously .
Well , now we can &apos;t leave .
H@@ o . Made sure of that , didn &apos;t he ?
Should be in hospital . That or one of them places .
He &apos;ll get better !
And the day he does is the day we go .
Is that clear
G@@ ot a letter from Japan .
It &apos;s from Mr. U@@ me@@ z@@ aki .
Have you read it ?
No . W@@ an@@ ted to .
S@@ in of desire . You@@ l &apos;re a Catholic .
M@@ um says you throw out most of the letters you get .
And why do you think that is ?
The people who write want you to solve things .
If you read their letters , you &apos;d want to help .
Oh , no . You give me too much credit .
It &apos;s just if I were to read them ,
Perhaps Mr. U@@ me@@ z@@ aki &apos;s asking you to go back to Japan .
Oh . I &apos;ll never go back to Japan .
Why not ?
Long journey , old man .
The crime wave that has done away
Well . If you need susp@@ ects , you know where to find me .
M@@ um , wait .
I bet if we asked , Mr. Hol@@ mes would .. do his thing
I &apos;m sure your mother doesn &apos;t need to be told where she &apos;s been .
Let &apos;s not bo@@ ther Mr. Hol@@ mes with any f@@ oo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness .
It &apos;s not f@@ oo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness . Here .
Do it
No , that won &apos;t be necessary .
Turn in a circle .
You &apos;ve been away most of the day .
The s@@ oot on your dress att@@ ests that you went by train to Por@@ ts@@ mouth ,
In For@@ ts@@ mouth , you met the couple who run the hotel .
wish@@ ed to make a favourable impression .
They made you an offer , you accepted
There is no sh@@ ame in what I do !
You compla@@ in enough about it ! Always going on about how hard things are .
And you wish you had it better !
She can bar@@ ely read !
GO after her .
Your dad h@@ ated what he did for a living .
Mechan@@ ic in a garage , like his dad before him .
When he got called up , he said to me ,
I &apos;m gon@@ na put in for the RA@@ F &apos; &quot;
B@@ lown out of the sky . First time up .
All his mates who worked the motor pool came home without a scrat@@ ch .
I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have said what I said
Don &apos;t say everything you think .
T@@ n your desk .
Cou@@ ldn &apos;t have . The one in the corner .
Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t know it was a desk until I opened it .
Oh , that &apos;s not my desk , it &apos;s John &apos;s .
He left it at B@@ aker Street when he went off to get married
I know you say Dr. Wat@@ son didn &apos;t always get things right ,
Yes , but in Wat@@ son &apos;s story , he does have the ar@@ mon@@ ica in it .
And the German lady . And that g@@ love .
So maybe he did get things right .
No , that &apos;s not possible .
John had gone from B@@ aker Street by then .
Well , then why was it in there ?
I don &apos;t know ! And if I ever did know , I don &apos;t remember .
If you can &apos;t remember , then why couldn &apos;t the case have been a success
And if I &apos;d brought it to a successful conclusion ,
I chose ex@@ ile for my punishment , but what was it for ?
I must have done something terri@@ bly wrong ..
One can &apos;t solve everything
They &apos;re all common@@ place .
Lo@@ gic is rare .
The dead are not so very far away .
They &apos;re just on the other side of the wall .
Now , whenever did you say that ?
P@@ ly your parl@@ our tri@@ cks elsewhere , Mr. Hol@@ mes .
My husband could never succeed at dec@@ eption
I don &apos;t know much about your profession ,
To keep you from this appointment you seem so e@@ ager to make .
Even before I gli@@ mp@@ sed you today ,
The man who took away the music you loved ,
All these predic@@ ted your anti@@ pa@@ thy .
And then I witness@@ ed your actions .
For@@ ging his signature ,
A convinc@@ ing set of circumstances ,
But for two errors .
We must place bl@@ ame on your husband for the first .
I would also make the observation that there is nothing about you
Was that the second error
The second was un@@ avo@@ id@@ able , and all the more dam@@ ning .
The man at the station .
Everything about him , his clothes , the pat@@ ches on his tro@@ users ,
St@@ on@@ em@@ ason .
Money must have been a di@@ re necessity ,
The money was to pay for the head@@ stones
For Grace . For T@@ ames .
Sho@@ ck
I was certain he wasn &apos;t .
No , no ! No , Mrs. Mun@@ ro , no !
Z@@ ou mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t do that !
My son .... won &apos;t wake .
He may never wake .
They sent me away till morning .
You didn &apos;t even have the dec@@ ency
didn &apos;t think it would make a difference .
They &apos;re all you care about !
No ! I care about Roger .
I care about him very much .
The be@@ es . didn &apos;t do it .
The be@@ es were not to bl@@ ame
Roger was trying to find out what was killing the be@@ es .
And he did . He found the was@@ ps &apos; nest .
He had to stop them wi@@ ping out the be@@ es .
And so he did the worst possible thing .
I@@ e tried to dro@@ wn them with water from his can .
How do you know it was them ?
Be@@ es leave their st@@ ings . W@@ as@@ ps don &apos;t .
There were no st@@ ings left in Roger &apos;s face .
And when they attacked , he dropped the wat@@ ering can
I knew her less than a day .
A quarter of an hour &apos;s conversation .
She needed my help .
She needed so desper@@ ately to be understood by someone
I wat@@ ched her walk away .
Well , that &apos;s what the people like .
They like pun@@ chy
That &apos;s what they want , my love .
I &apos;m an artist .
It is not for me to question my gift ,
Come here and give P@@ unch some love .
what ?
Oh . Come on
My sweet and tal@@ ented wife !
So blessed I am to have va .
Sweet and tal@@ ented indeed .
There you go ! Look at you
You &apos;ve gone and turned her stomach up@@ side down .
That thing does nothing but bel@@ low
And before I knew it
I thought for certain
But as the ground came up to meet me ,
I s@@ ank into it .
And when I a@@ wo@@ ke
From over here
Sorry , Dr. Good@@ time ,
Don &apos;t r@@ ush me , and then
I don &apos;t mean to r@@ ush you
We &apos;re about to be on the move .
We can only take what &apos;s useful .
We don &apos;t got no space for nothing more .
But this one &apos;s a good one .
She &apos;s got skills in the theatre .
Sk@@ ills in the theatre ..
This pupp@@ et is broken . P@@ unch !
I &apos;m telling you , it won &apos;t do a thing right !
You can &apos;t be dro@@ pping the pupp@@ ets .
They &apos;re mighty delicate .
If you break this one &apos;s face ,
You &apos;re of simple mind .
If one thing ever
But the simple pleasure is
Oh . Well
Oh , yes .
When you &apos;ve lived as long as I have ,
When things ti@@ lt off in a way they sh@@ ouldn &apos;t
Some@@ one is close to ro@@ using the De@@ vil .
He &apos;s right there watching the re@@ hear@@ sal .
And I say this line , I just look at him like , &quot; I &apos;m so sorry . &quot;
But he was right there .
I remember Simon being very nervous to do his im@@ person@@ ation .
I would not do your Stephen Haw@@ king impression in front of him .
I supp@@ ose that could be considered offensive .
That &apos;s , obviously , A@@ my &apos;s incredible dress from their wedding .
Wo@@ w ! You look like a p@@ ile of sw@@ ans .
And Mark Ham@@ ill offici@@ ated .
A@@ my do you take Shel@@ don for your law@@ ful we@@ d@@ ded husband ?
I do .
And , Shel@@ don , same thing .
Over here , the f@@ encing out@@ fit .
I was very excited by ...
Max , what is that thing that you have behind your back ?
What ? No , nothing .
Yes , right here .
Is that the auction catalog
No , you &apos;re watching an episode
What is this thing doing here ?
You do so much with so little fabric .
I do ..
And I see you too + B@@ 125 : B@@ 130@@ k my advice and got Polish Vog@@ ue .
How nice is this ?
We are finally on a romantic date .
We just came from lunch at Rain@@ bow Room ,
Y@@ ah , now , he &apos;s going to buy me something golden .
Y@@ ah , I want to be covered in gold .
I want a golden shower .
Let &apos;s see . If I was a loving cup ,
Some place with a lot of cash sho@@ ved up inside you .
How much do you think is in there ?
Well , let &apos;s see . The wooden base of the cup is about this big ,
That &apos;s like a million dollars !
So I could have $ 60@@ ,000 in an hour ?
Well , we . We could have it .
Did I say I ? How wei@@ rd .
And sold .
Wo@@ w , you &apos;re getting everything .
Yes , we are .
Ar@@ en &apos;t we , Miss Pick@@ le ?
I &apos;m Ham@@ ish Mc@@ don@@ ough , by the way .
Oh , I &apos;m Max , and this is my friend K@@ ati@@ e Hol@@ mes .
We won &apos;t speak of it ..
But I just have to say : well done !
And if you ever need anything , don &apos;t hesitate .
Oh , you have your own shop ?
&quot; Just the two of us &quot; Anti@@ ques .
Is that you and Miss Pick@@ le ?
No , dear , I &apos;m not ins@@ ane .
Next item for auction :
This is highly un@@ orthodo@@ x , but I shall repeat the item .
Do I hear 80@@ ,000 ?
Yes , you do !
80@@ ,000 going once , going twice ,
Y@@ olo !
And the next item up for bid
How much do you think this is going to go for ?
Kit@@ sch is always a wild card , but it has no real value .
No real value ? Please .
I won that when no one thought I could .
I j@@ ump@@ ed 14 hur@@ d@@ les in the rain with walking pneum@@ onia .
It &apos;s worth something .
Ye@@ ah , &apos; cause it has mon@@ ey@@ . in it .
We start the bi@@ dding at $ 50 .
Sir , it &apos;s in incre@@ ments of $ 10 .
Then , I &apos;m out .
Sorry , the Rain@@ bow Room really su@@ cked me dry .
H@@ m , gu@@ ess what else is pretty dry right now ?
Do I hear 60 ?
Ham@@ ish came to play .
So did we , I broke my hy@@ men getting that thing .
Is that why it &apos;s called a loving cup ?
200 . I have 200 .
Do I hear 225 ?
Look , Ham@@ ish .
I know you have no interest in what I would normally
Don &apos;t be so sure . I was bis@@ ex@@ ual till I was 62 .
Look , K@@ ati@@ e Hol@@ mes really wants this ,
True . It &apos;s yours . I &apos;m out .
200 going once , going twice .
S@@ old . Yes , I &apos;m rich !
Did you just say &quot; I &apos;m &quot; ?
I think you &apos;re hearing me wrong .
Ok@@ ay , before we use all this money on the business ,
You , me , Ch@@ est@@ nut , jet sk@@ is .
how many calls ?
thre@@ e. all out@@ going .
how do we know this guy &apos;s
not that i &apos;m compla@@ ining .
i &apos;ve had some fil@@ thy , fil@@ thy times in this state .
don &apos;t screw this up , all right ?
because that &apos;s our only lead on this guy .
there were threats , you and l@@ inc@@ ol@@ n might be kid@@ n@@ apped .
you were in im@@ min@@ ent danger .
really .
where was she when my brother was stra@@ pped
she &apos;d been working in a ma@@ d@@ ag@@ as@@ car rain forest ,
or she wasn &apos;t alive , has@@ n &apos;t been for 25 years ,
she &apos;s on her way .
oh , my god !
why &apos;d this guy call the club &apos;s phone and not er@@ ica &apos;s ?
i@@ . they fight a lot ,
what do you want with this guy ?
he took something that belongs to me .
you did good .
i just need a smoke so bad .
oh , no .
what ?
my wal@@ let .
this is the ch@@ ick who set me up .
we find her , we find our guy .
bu@@ sting up clubs , fir@@ ing shots in public .
you keep that up and we &apos;re not going to last here much longer .
i don &apos;t plan on staying here very long@@ . you ?
he puts four enemies together , guaranteed dis@@ sen@@ sion .
no alli@@ ances form against him .
this is our guy &apos;s girlfriend &apos;s address .
he &apos;s probably gone ,
this is tia .
do you want to know what i think they were talking about ?
someone else &apos;s words heavily par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ased .
and it per@@ tains to buildings , structures .
i think you meant it as a met@@ aph@@ or .
what , that the ends justi@@ fy the means ?
which ne@@ at@@ ly
did you know that she had an almost identical quote
from 30 years ago .
you &apos;ve done a lot of hom@@ e@@ work .
just a few convers@@ ations .
let me gu@@ ess@@ . you two had some kind of moment
I &apos;ve known your mother for years .
well enough to know you &apos;ve got the same brilliant mind
I &apos;m gu@@ essing this isn &apos;t about my sense of hum@@ or .
she was just
but then she learned the truth .
if the truth is that the company is all about saving the world ,
and if my mother is so brilliant and active in the company ,
it can &apos;t be managed by one person .
but two ...
equally form@@ id@@ able , working in lock@@ step ?
absolutely .
that &apos;s very good .
you &apos;ve clearly thought of everything .
m@@ ich@@ ael ..
if i weren &apos;t telling you the truth ,
this is just a st@@ up@@ id girl who dates a criminal .
this is a waste of time .
a signature of bur@@ rows &apos; leadership .
all right , we need to make a shift .
my aim is true , don .
keep it in your p@@ ants .
i &apos;ll keep it in my p@@ ants , all right ?
all right , all in favor of changing the regime , say &quot; a@@ ye . &quot;
ay@@ e. all right , bur@@ rows is out .
good , great@@ . send it .
the company &apos;s e-@@ mail@@ ing tia &apos;s credit card history .
you know , i &apos;m thinking more and more that this is an inside job .
a big ol &apos; go@@ ose egg .
no@@ th@@ ing@@ . old address books , photographs ,
i checked her e-@@ mails and her web sites .
there &apos;s nothing from our guy .
are you sure this girlfriend route is the way to go here ?
because this is starting to feel like a wa@@ sted trip .
how long is it gon@@ na take the company
a couple hours .
you &apos;re no longer in charge .
u@@ h-@@ oh , looks like there &apos;s been a re@@ count .
bad time ?
no , perfect .
the second you stop doing what i tell you to do ,
bring her back .
it &apos;s not gon@@ na be the same .
why ? because two years later it was gone ?
you know , three of the four
so what are you sug@@ gest@@ ing ,
time for a ... a family re@@ union in w@@ y@@ oming ?
or wherever you like .
don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s something you haven &apos;t wish@@ ed for .
why ,
these pictures could have been taken anywhere at any time .
before you were incar@@ cer@@ ated ,
you &apos;d bring a bouquet of blue ir@@ ises .
you &apos;d sit for an hour .
i said stop it .
when you &apos;d leave , you &apos;d take a flower
she wat@@ ched you do this every year .
she &apos;s seen the pain you carry .
she wants to make am@@ ends .
all right !
the company can &apos;t know i &apos;m talking to you .
you are the compan@@ y. you &apos;re his daughter .
do you want to find m@@ ich@@ ael sco@@ field ?
of course id@@ o .
it &apos;s 60 miles northeast
what are they doing to him ?
having lem@@ on@@ ade .
they &apos;re car@@ ving out his personality .
that &apos;s how they recru@@ it .
or you &apos;re setting me up .
c@@ lan@@ dest@@ ine war@@ fare isn &apos;t pretty ,
at least not for me .
m@@ ich@@ ael is the object of a quick and n@@ asty
out .
we need the foot@@ age from that security camera .
not to off@@ end either of you , but i took
S@@ ure
A deal &apos;s a deal , right ? not to be a broken record , but all I ask ..
But I think we &apos;re making some real progress , general .
The sco@@ field / bur@@ rows family would have been a form@@ id@@ able asset to the
General , we can handle a l@@ one female .
If , indeed , that &apos;s what we &apos;re dealing with .
But it &apos;s my experience , that with the one comes many .
Do it now , doctor .
I want sco@@ field p@@ liable for transit .
Your vehicle arri@@ ves in 20 minutes .
And if we can &apos;t revi@@ ve him ?
Michael , come out@@ . we need to talk .
make yourself a hel@@ met , p@@ al .
we pulled his image off the security tape .
company &apos;s running a recognition match right now .
that &apos;s great , but that &apos;s going to take all day .
do you know where he is right now ? with wil@@ cot@@ t .
we need to go now .
because better yet ,
Th@@ row him a ball or something .
Oh , ok@@ ay , y@@ e@@ ah . That &apos;s a great idea .
Ok@@ ay , on the count of 3 , C@@ al .
Are you ready ? 1 , 2 , 3 !
Oh . Ok@@ ay .
All right , um ... . well , hu@@ gs !
What the hell ? !
Oh , is the hot dog making you angry ?
An angry stomach is 12 % larger .
I think we &apos;ve got a real shot
But they &apos;re un@@ defeated .
I gu@@ ess that makes us &quot; Under@@ -@@ dogs . &quot;
Not as long as you &apos;ve been sitting on that couch .
H@@ ey , h@@ ey . Can I get in on that floor ba@@ gel ?
Alex decided to take off some time earlier this summer ,
Who &apos;s there ?

But you &apos;re still the best crew a captain could wish for .
Don &apos;t forget Pol@@ ly .
And not for@@ getting , never for@@ getting .
Pol@@ ly , the finest par@@ rot to sa@@ il the seven seas .
Come on , girl .

Do you want to give the order to attack ?
No , not really , Number Two . No , I think I &apos;ve ...
Think I had enough of pi@@ racy .
I &apos;m hanging up my cut@@ lass .
Captain , no !
Ye@@ ah , I was thinking I might go into baby clothes , actually .
What ?
I hear there &apos;s a fort@@ une to be made in baby clothes
No , but you can &apos;t . I mean , the crew ..
And the running people through .
Well , I .. I do enjoy running people through .
Enjoy it ? You &apos;re brilliant at it !
You &apos;re a br@@ ine-@@ so@@ aked terror of the high seas !
Do you think so , Number Two ?
Everyone does !
You &apos;re more of a pir@@ ate than Black Bell@@ am@@ y or any of them .
You &apos;re a real pir@@ ate .
That &apos;s why the crew ,
Why do you think they all
What do you say ?

Hon@@ est@@ ly , Number Two , what &apos;s got into you ?
Thanks to Charles , we &apos;re about to win la@@ vis@@ h un@@ told ri@@ ches ,

That &apos;s lovely . Now , that is lovely .
Can you do the shi@@ ver a timber ?
And just ch@@ u@@ ck in a few g@@ ul@@ ls , would you ?
Ladies and gentlemen , our winner .

You are a pir@@ ate no more !
And stay out !
Yes , well , not a ... Not a total success .
We don &apos;t need them and their st@@ up@@ id awards .
The best thing about being a pir@@ ate isn &apos;t the treasure .
She gave half of us tet@@ an@@ us , for good@@ ness sake .
But she was our Pol@@ ly .
Well , you know , you should be happy for her .
She &apos;ll be , she &apos;ll be living the high life .
E@@ ating gold bri@@ cks wra@@ pped up in , you know , sw@@ ans .

Like ser@@ ran@@ o ham and ,
And they are aw@@ fully fast .
F@@ aster than a horse , if you can believe that .
And they &apos;ve got an aw@@ ful fer@@ o@@ cious b@@ ite .
How about that ? You know , the funny thing is ,
knowing much about hi@@ p@@ pos until right now .
Maybe if we could get through this quick@@ er .
Well , another thing is , they can run up to 45 miles per hour ,
Did you know that ? Fas@@ cin@@ ating .
What a magnificent cre@@ ature .
We should get out of here .
What else do you know ?
Here &apos;s another interesting fact .
They have three stom@@ ach@@ s . How about that ?
Ah ! Come on . Be@@ at it !
Don &apos;t get so close .
Just a bird , ok@@ ay ? Come on , get moving . Get out of here .
Any@@ thing else we need to know ?
Be@@ at it , bird .

You got a clu@@ e for her .
Wa@@ it .
She &apos;s your ex-@@ girlfriend . She &apos;s the fl@@ ame .
It &apos;s not the moment for it . For@@ get it .
I did it . I don &apos;t know what it was .
Look like your stomach is up@@ set .
Like you ate something bad .
Oh , man .
I &apos;m swe@@ ating . I &apos;m swe@@ ating .
Ste@@ aling makes me very un@@ comfortable ,
So the fruit is in the tree .
But you can &apos;t get to it
Don &apos;t worry about it .
Mil@@ o , what are you doing ?
H@@ old on . Wa@@ it , wait . Here we go .
You want a piece of me , hu@@ h ? That &apos;s what you want ?
You do not want a piece of him , Mil@@ o , I &apos;m telling you .
Oh , that &apos;s where you &apos;re wrong , young man .
I don &apos;t know when ! When I get there !
The doctor will be in to see you as soon as she can .
He . Dr. R@@ iel@@ ding is a he

Then again , he had read that condem@@ ned prisoners ..
often asked for pe@@ an@@ ut butter and j@@ el@@ ly sand@@ wi@@ ches
And , of course , there was Henry &apos;s biggest concern .
Would he be able to raise the flag at all
not for a medical m@@ l@@ rac@@ C e
I know I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be telling you this
And I didn &apos;t ?
You just can &apos;t honor the son we lost ..
and you drove away the one we do still have !
T@@ omm@@ y doesn &apos;t des@@ erve that !
This has nothing to do with T@@ omm@@ y !
You never accepted his life choices !
Ball@@ room dancing is not a life choice
Ru@@ ck you !
Ye@@ ah .
He is patient , kind and here !
So &apos;s a span@@ iel ! Get a pet !
I wish you were dead !
Well , it &apos;s your lucky fu@@ cking day !
Tom@@ p@@ kins and Kan@@ e .
There &apos;s a big tip in it
Not possible .
Of course it &apos;s possible . Speed , run red lights .
But , no , there &apos;s no need to speed , right ?
It &apos;s a medical emergency .
We don &apos;t w@@ anna get into an accident .
They have cameras at the lights . I would receive tickets .
Just charge me for the minute , come on .
Just give this to me . You just take too long .
That &apos;s a lot more than ..
Here you go .
Ok@@ ay , so what did we just talk about ?
Brooklyn Dance Academy , dancing that anyone can learn .
How can I help you ?
It &apos;s Henry Alt@@ mann again . Is T@@ omm@@ y there ?
No , I &apos;m sorry .
It &apos;s his break and he went to go get a sli@@ ce of p@@ izza .
All in all , the family photos had the decided effect

So it &apos;s important to you .

All depends on how you hit the water .
Wa@@ it , wait , wait . He went to the bridge ?
Are you my thor@@ n ? My n@@ em@@ esis ?
Is it necessary for you to tor@@ ment me until the very end ?
Have you m@@ no hum@@ ility , no humanity ..

Ok@@ ay ? I used to love my patients !
That is why I went into medicine !
Oh , God . No , no , please !
Oh , God .
It al comes down to this .
If you jump ..

You gave me 90 minutes . It &apos;s not up yet .
Can I please ..

C@@ a m . Cal@@ m .
So I go across the street to buy a video camera from this nice guy .
A little bit
And I give the video camera to a hom@@ eless guy
And I get a little up@@ set because after law school .
he decides to be a dance instruc@@ tor rather than a lawyer .
The hom@@ eless guy ?
No , my son .
I had all these business cards printed up .
But what can you do ?
I got up@@ set and then I passed out .
And when I came to , I j@@ ump@@ ed off the Brooklyn Bridge .
That &apos;s when she shows up .
She j@@ umps in the East River .
She f@@ ishes me out . That &apos;s why we &apos;re wet .
what would you do if you knew how long you had ?
I would try and figure out how to be happy .
Then why don &apos;t you ?
Maybe I will .
If it &apos;s all right with you ,
No one expected Henry to survive one day .
Instead , he lived for eight days .
I heard about the accident , so I-@@ I r@@ ushed right over .
That &apos;s what neighb@@ ors do , right ?
Well , that &apos;s very thou@@ ght@@ ful .
We &apos;ll tell Gab@@ y you stopped by .
Ye@@ ah , don &apos;t feel like you have to hang around .
There &apos;s nothing we can do .
We can pray .
Dear lord , we ask that you be with this young child
and that she may be returned in full health
A@@ men .
Well , I have to get home . I &apos;m exp@@ ecting someone .
Please extend my good wishes to Gab@@ y
A@@ men .
Oh , Gab@@ y , thank God .

Ok@@ ay . Fine . But while we &apos;re talking about the radio ,
Who is it :
Oh , u@@ h , hang on a second .
Ah , I was just wra@@ pping up my first session .

Now .. You see what I &apos;m doing here ?

Not with my settlement .
With New York prices ,
Oh , my God . How will you keep from b@@ umping into yourself ?
You know what I was thinking ?

You love the theater , museums .
You said yourself ,

Re@@ ally , how hard is it to clean the pot ?
H@@ ey ! How &apos;d it go with the doctor ?
Ye@@ ah , can , u@@ h , we , um ...
Talk about that ?
So what did the doctor say ?
You &apos;re gon@@ na w@@ anna sit down .

And you &apos;re the one who told me to go to the doctor .
not so you could , u@@ h ...
Oh , &quot; Take long ba@@ ths or get in some extra n@@ aps &quot; ?
Do me a favor . Read the whole p@@ amp@@ h@@ let .
G@@ os@@ h , I wish I could , Tom .
Unfortunately , I have to go take care of my other baby .
Dinner is wonderful .
I wanted ton@@ ight to be special .
Since the prison didn &apos;t allow con@@ ju@@ gal visits ,
About that ..
I can &apos;t wait to start cooking for you
but there are certain other ... .
I &apos;ve been faithful to my husband .

I was finally reaching my target heart rate on my walk .
I may like my bed and my food soft ,
I gu@@ ess I was hop@@ ing ...
Hop@@ ing what ?
That one day I might out@@ grow all this .
Ah , that &apos;s why you fired K@@ eit@@ h .
I just can &apos;t have him around . He &apos;s too dist@@ rac@@ ting .
And I refuse to make a f@@ ool of myself .
And how would that happen ?
B@@ ree , I can &apos;t tell you how to live your life .
All I know is that not living your life isn &apos;t the answer .
I &apos;ve just@@ . never been very good at taking risks .
Well , then get good , because take my word for it ,
Don &apos;t feel like you have to help or anything .
Cool .

I didn &apos;t think that was gon@@ na happen either .
How &apos;d you find me ?
You follow the sc@@ ent of my non@@ exist@@ ent c@@ olog@@ ne ?
No . Your ans@@ wering service said I might find you here .
I was a little out of sor@@ ts the other day ,
They run great , they &apos;re easy to work on .
But he bought a Mas@@ er@@ ati .
The thing is always in the shop .
very temper@@ amental ,
You seem like kind of a Mas@@ er@@ ati to me .
I &apos;m no Mas@@ er@@ ati , K@@ eit@@ h .
I &apos;m a family se@@ dan with a bei@@ ge interior
Well , I &apos;m sorry about that ,
You &apos;ve seen my house . It &apos;s kind of a m@@ ess .
And the truth is , my life &apos;s kind of a m@@ ess , too .
And when you came in
My house , not my life .
I just want you to work on the house .
I really do sound like a Mas@@ er@@ ati .
Thanks for listening .
Oh , my god .
Cle@@ arly , you are a distur@@ bed young woman .
The good news is ,
All I ask in return is for a little aff@@ ection .
Do you think you can offer me that ?
I &apos;ll try .
Good .
I &apos;m a patient man , Bet@@ h .
But just so we &apos;re clear ,
Don &apos;t worry . I cleaned the pot .
The way things have been going l@@ ately .
I &apos;m not as wor@@ ried about taste as I am po@@ ison .
But you were right to make me talk to Tom ,
You &apos;re welcome .
You know , when I don &apos;t feel like killing you .
I think I like having you around .
Good to know since
Ye@@ ah , please , and is the end of today too ambitious ?

Good to meet you too .
Super aw@@ k@@ ward . Wh@@ ole first half of the conversation ,
Re@@ ally ?

It wasn &apos;t a very happy ending .
It sent me into a bit of a rough patch .
I will b@@ ore you with the details some other time .
Ye@@ ah , no , I revised the plan to include the open stair@@ case .
If you want , my assistant is in Chicago . She can get you a hard copy .

Do you have a baby ?
No . No
I mean that &apos;s pretty much it .
It &apos;s going to come up looking real nice . It &apos;s already great .
Thank you .
I should go and check on that .
In fact , there &apos;s plenty of food
Oh , I don &apos;t want to ...
Ye@@ ah , security for large corpor@@ ations .
Like in , you know , information protection .
Ye@@ ah . Comp@@ lic@@ ated stuff

We &apos;re developing more and more for personal use ,
Kind of wi@@ dening out .
And what do you think about this
As long as you stay healthy ,
I want you to start re@@ building the business .
You know , what do I care ?
I just don &apos;t want you to be stressed , honey ,
Especially if you really want to start a family .
Ok@@ ay .
Kids are honest .
Why do you get a name like Wei@@ r@@ do ?
Well , I think that he &apos;s mis@@ understood .
Maybe .
It &apos;s not our job to figure out what he is .
I can tell you he &apos;s a reverse th@@ ief .
Bre@@ aking in to give us something ? It &apos;s not very bright .
Right . M@@ mm@@ -@@ h@@ mm .
I hope his next gift is a s@@ ush@@ i knife for those fish .
You got a new friend .
Ha@@ -@@ ha
Hi . I was in the area . I was wondering , is ... Oh .
No . He &apos;s at work . Ye@@ ah
The fish are beautiful . Re@@ ally beautiful . Thank you .
Well , ask and thou shall receive , hu@@ h , Mr. Bo@@ j@@ ang@@ les ?
You know , most people think that Sam@@ my Davis J@@ r. or N@@ ina Sim@@ one
Re@@ ally ?
Ye@@ ah .
Did not know that .
My dad named him , actually .
You &apos;re a bit of a door-@@ half-@@ open kind of person ?
I love you for it , but you know .
You could just poli@@ t@@ ely decline ,
But he would offer an alternative , you know ?
He &apos;ll keep coming around and around and around , so .
So basically , eventually , you two need to have a conversation .
Oh , God , Simon .
Y@@ ep .
Come on , honey . This guy likes you so much . Tell me you don &apos;t see it .
Come on . I really don &apos;t think that is the reason why .
Come on , honey .
Why all the drop in &apos;s and the stop by &apos;s
Look at this thing . Good Lord .
I think you &apos;re slightly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating .
I think he &apos;s ob@@ s@@ essed with you , honey .
I think he wants to nail you .
I think he wants to be me ,
It seems I have mis@@ jud@@ ged our situation .
Please know that I would never do anything to up@@ set you both ,
However , I will honor your wishes
You won &apos;t hear from me again ,
expres@@ ses how sorry I am that things turned out the way they did .
I also ap@@ ologi@@ ze about the dinner . &quot;
Turn it over . There &apos;s more
Well , you &apos;re not for@@ getting that this guy &apos;s not exactly stable ?
But he seems ok@@ ay , right ? Other than that ?
And we &apos;re ok@@ ay , J@@ ang@@ les is ok@@ ay , everybody &apos;s ok@@ ay .
So whatever this was , let &apos;s put it behind us .
Get him out of our minds , and get on with it .
You know , what do you say ?
Question mark , sm@@ il@@ ey face .
Simon ?
Wh@@ ole semester , I &apos;m still not going to admit that I did it .
Ye@@ ah . Ye@@ ah , I do .
I &apos;m glad you said that , &apos; cause
What &apos;s going on with you ?
I thought we left all this back in Chicago .
Rob@@ yn , you worked real fast here .
You got yourself a doctor too already ?
Ok@@ ay , ok@@ ay , look .
Simon , I .
I need you to call him .
He made peace with us . I think that we have to make peace with him .
What &apos;s he got to do with that ?
&quot; C@@ ause I &apos;m not feeling good right now .
I feel sc@@ ared when I &apos;m here by myself
Why would he
It &apos;s made me kind of crazy . I ... &quot; Ye@@ ah .
You &apos;re probably par@@ an@@ oid from the p@@ ills .
No , it wasn &apos;t because of the p@@ ills .
I didn &apos;t take any .
Are you sure ?
No , I didn &apos;t take any . No , I wasn &apos;t .
Are you mixing this stuff with anything ?
This has nothing to do with p@@ ills
Do you want to turn the place up@@ side down like you did the last one ?
Will you please just listen to me ?
If we say sorry to him , we will make this right
Rob@@ yn , it &apos;s over .
Oh , my God .
And J@@ ang@@ les .
I mean , if you still believe that he took J@@ ang@@ les , which you do ,
You asked me if there &apos;s something I want to tell you .
This sh@@ it , it &apos;s over !
Is there something that you w@@ anna tell me ?
The subject is closed .
look at what he &apos;s done to US . This is his f@@ aut .
It &apos;s not my fault , it &apos;s not your fault .
That &apos;s why we &apos;ve got to just put it behind us .
I want you to just look forward
It he@@ als everything .
Let &apos;s just get on with doing what we came here to do .
Let &apos;s make a family .
We &apos; start a new life
It &apos;s really important to not look back .
No , it &apos;s cute . No .
Listen , so don &apos;t look now ,
Ye@@ ah . Do you see him ? Right there ?
Oh , my God .
It &apos;s him@@ . it &apos;s the guy from before . The one I told you about .
Well , Rob@@ yn , don &apos;t
It &apos;s great .
Ye@@ ah .
It goes with the st@@ roller .

&quot; Put your mind at ease . This guy is a nobody . &quot;
&quot; 2005 , breaking and entering De Fac@@ tos &apos; residence . &quot;
Rob@@ yn , why don &apos;t you just ask him ?
Ok@@ ay , so you can &apos;t talk to your husband .
What are you going to do ?
I want to find this Gre@@ g guy .
Simon &apos;s sister said he was involved somehow
Well , maybe you should do some checking of your own .
Gre@@ g Pier@@ son .
I came here today &apos; cause I need to talk to you about a Gordon Mos@@ ley .
&quot; Simon , just after all these years , &quot;
&quot; Behold he who conc@@ ei@@ ves mis@@ chief and brings forth fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
Look , I think he wants to hurt us
Simon &apos;s sister told me that you and him
If you were helping him ,
He wasn &apos;t being mol@@ ested .
God , this is crazy .
What do you mean , he wasn &apos;t being mol@@ ested ?
She told me that he was found in a car with a

About how I might not have treated you so well ,
You accept my ap@@ ology ?
Z@@ ou see , it &apos;s too late for that .
G@@ ot it . Ok@@ ay .
You know , I was willing
Ye@@ ah . What the fu@@ ck do you think I &apos;m doing here ?
See , you &apos;re done with the past ,
What ? What do you mean by that ?
It &apos;s a saying .
I know it &apos;s a saying , but what do you mean ?
H@@ ey , I asked you a question .

Well , good luck with that , m@@ ate .

Good morning , everyone ,
It was a Friday night .
I was going out with my girlfriend .
I h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t seen her for all week
All of a sudden this guy is k@@ icking the car , h@@ itting the bon@@ net ,
He pun@@ ches me in the face .
He hits my head off the car bon@@ net .
Star@@ ts k@@ icking into me , I &apos;m on the ground .
I just remember hearing Lind@@ say beg@@ ging for him to stop .
I just remember thinking ,
Bro@@ ken ri@@ bs , cra@@ cked wr@@ ist .
And , my eve was all mess@@ ed up .
The sur@@ geon said that I was very lucky ,
He had a frac@@ tured eye so@@ cket , which has left him with a squ@@ int :
I thought my son was gon@@ na die .
I thought I &apos;d lost him
When he came back out the hospital ,
He just wanted to go into his room , on his own . Do nothing
He packed up his college .
He split up with his girlfriend .
You &apos;re nothing .
You &apos;re just a we@@ e th@@ u@@ g that doesn &apos;t know any better
Will Luke fight his son ?
Just stuck , in the same sh@@ it .
S@@ car@@ ed to lose face .
In front of who
Harry , where are you taking us ?
Wa@@ it and see .
Now listen , you lot . This is my day off .

So I want you to all repeat after me ,
Any@@ body don &apos;t say it ,

I her@@ eby do sol@@ em@@ n@@ ly swe@@ ar
What I want you to do is just get your head in there
You &apos;re at it
It really is such a beautiful room .
Be careful you don &apos;t touch anything though .
It &apos;s really hot and you could burn yourself .
Come on up .
So this is the still house
It &apos;s kin@@ da like the heart of the di@@ stil@@ lery .
It &apos;s where all the magic really does happen ,
If I was to change one of these still@@ s ,
Come on , follow me .
She &apos;s got the body of a go@@ dd@@ ess .
Come on round this one here .
And they were cra@@ fted so beautifully that they actually brea@@ the .

You st@@ up@@ id ? You no go to school ,
Don &apos;t give a fu@@ ck , you &apos;ll b@@ low us all up , man
Sorry about that , Ma@@ ir@@ i .
Thank you .
How long do you keep the whis@@ ky in the cas@@ ks for ?
Ten , twenty , thirty years . It just depends .
What &apos;s the most expensive one ?
The most expensive ?
Well , we actually found a c@@ ask about a year ago .
And we sold one bottle from the c@@ ask for 100,000 pounds .
100,000 pounds ?
You know I could buy 30@@ ,000 bottles of Buck@@ ie for that !
That &apos;s good . Ave , that is good
Now , our n@@ oses are so sensitive
It &apos;s our most pri@@ mi@@ tive sense .
Right here goes back to when we used to
Well , some people will never change , eh ?
I had one double and that was it .
We were watching you .
I had one .
Put your f@@ ags out , boys .
It &apos;s no smoking in the van , you know the score .
All abo@@ ard !
Did you ste@@ al something , M@@ o ?
Nothing .
Do@@ esn &apos;t sound like nothing , M@@ o .
I couldn &apos;t res@@ ist it . It was far too easy in there .
Put them back .
Harry could lose his job .
Do you want them ? You can have them .
I don &apos;t like whis@@ ky anyway . You have some ?
No , I don &apos;t fu@@ cking want them , M@@ o . We made Harry a promise .
So you read all these , then ?
You b@@ ast@@ ard .
N@@ ose it .
Fu@@ cking watch that a@@ erial , it &apos;s holding the tel@@ ly together .
Look at the state of the fu@@ cking thing .
What are you talking about ?
Fu@@ cking 6 pounds I paid for that bad boy !
They get it from the ground then they dig it up .
What ? You dig it up and you throw it in a drink ,
Look , give yourselves a bit of time , guys , right ?
I was like that at first ,
Right , give us it over . Let &apos;s try this one .
Fu@@ ck@@ ino volume . Work , work !
Volume , you b@@ ast@@ ard . Work . Fu@@ cking work .
A bit sp@@ icy .
Where does that smell come from ?
The cas@@ ks .
It &apos;s like , maybe like a short fer@@ mentation .
American oak gives off like co@@ con@@ ut , van@@ illa .
Maybe sometimes even like a chocolate .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s it .
Albert , I &apos;m telling you , m@@ ate . It &apos;s the truth .
Sea breeze , n@@ ut@@ ty and now fu@@ cking co@@ con@@ ut .
I &apos;m so@@ aking . I swe@@ ar I &apos;m wr@@ ing@@ ing

You all right there , M@@ o ?
All right , Harry .
B@@ ast@@ ard . She &apos;ll kill me if I go to Edinburgh , man .
Sorry , Harry , you need to send my ap@@ ologies , big man .
Never mind . Maybe next time , eh ?
What is that ?

Let &apos;s get a younger nose .

You can &apos;t do this . There &apos;s got@@ ta be something else .
Have you ever tried a M@@ alt M@@ ill ?

And the camera and the al@@ arms ?
The camera and the al@@ arms ?

Made me w@@ anna have a k@@ id .
You have no idea how many people told us the same thing
No , sorry , I &apos;ll be right back . Ye@@ ah , absolutely .
Great to talk to you . Ok@@ ay .
What image ? Where you left me as soon as I wasn &apos;t successful ?
You think I gave a sh@@ it if you were famous ?
All that I wanted was for you , I don &apos;t know , to care about me .
Care about you ? You left weeks after my father died .
Do you w@@ anna talk about car@@ ing ? Oh , God .
Wo@@ w .
You really let yourself off the h@@ ook , don &apos;t you ?
Good@@ b@@ ve . C@@ al . Good@@ b@@ ve .
Have a great life .

Oh , boy .
Writ@@ ing is sen@@ su@@ al . It &apos;s , u@@ h .
You should see me when I write . I &apos;m like an Olymp@@ ian .
Oh , really ?
I wi@@ eld my pen ..
Your pen ? ... i@@ ke a ligh@@ ts@@ aber .
What &apos;s going on here ? Cal@@ vin .
We , u@@ h@@ .@@ We thought we &apos;d take a di@@ p .
Because you don &apos;t want me doing anything !
You have all these rules and you don &apos;t tell me what they are .
until , wh@@ o@@ ops . I &apos;ve broken one .
And then you get to be dis@@ appointed with me ?
Ok@@ ay . U@@ h , do you w@@ anna know my rules ?
What ? I had a dream about a girl .
So I wrote it down .
I gave her a name .
Ru@@ by .
I wrote all kinds of things about her and then one day I wo@@ ke up and she ..
You were living in my house .
I can make you do anything .
All the same , I cannot help but write this for her .
To tell her :
I &apos;m sorry for so many things .
I couldn &apos;t see you when you were here
So is writing
A human being has been created out of ink , paper and the imagination . &quot;
.. but I have witness@@ ed a rare mi@@ racle .
Any writer can att@@ est ..
.. in the lu@@ ck@@ i@@ est , happ@@ i@@ est state
She came to me whol@@ ly herself .
I was just lucky enough to be there to catch her . &quot;
Not really , no .
I can write more for you though , El@@ ton .
I &apos;ll just send them down to you .
Great . That &apos;d be good .
Great .
My real name &apos;s Reg@@ gie D@@ w@@ ight .
Cool .
Ye@@ ah , it sounds like a cow@@ boy name .
Ye@@ ah , all I ever , u@@ h ...
All I ever wanted to be was a cow@@ boy , you see .
We &apos;re song writing .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah ?
L@@ ooks like it &apos;s going well .
Right , I &apos;m not having a m@@ ess in this house .
It &apos;s nice and ti@@ dy and that &apos;s how I want it to stay .
There &apos;s never been a problem before .
And there isn &apos;t one now .
Look , there &apos;s loads of work .
Comm@@ it@@ ments , tours , et@@ c@@ et@@ era .
That &apos;s what I &apos;ll be doing . Personal management .
T@@ aking care of things .
Is that right ?
You realize I &apos;ve got a contract with El@@ ton .
I &apos;ve had that looked into .
And now my client is quite entitled
That &apos;s what you think .
Every time we open a paper ,
You &apos;re breaking your poor m@@ um &apos;s heart .
Tell you what , I &apos;ll write you a check . H@@ mm ?
So &apos;s you can go buy a new one .
Typical that you &apos;d say something like that about me .
When I &apos;ve given up so much for you .
What have you given up for me ?
Your father for a start .
You really are a hear@@ t@@ less monster .
You know , I don &apos;t live my life in black and white .
And I do not want your fu@@ cked up fri@@ gi@@ d ideas about anything .
You know , I am so sick of running away from who I am .
There &apos;s nothing wrong with success .
Or pleasure . In fact , why am I ap@@ ologi@@ zing for it ?
M@@ um , I have fu@@ cked everything that moves .
And I &apos;ve taken every drug known to man .
All of them .
Some girl was more important to you than me .
And all those le@@ gends who were welcoming us in .
You left me at the most important time , Ber@@ nie .
When did you give up ?
If you don &apos;t care about yourself ,
Wh@@ enever I needed you most ,
It &apos;s not weak
I have worked my balls off
Day in , day out .
For years .
And now , it &apos;s me that can &apos;t walk down the streets .
It &apos;s me who doesn &apos;t have a life .
You should come along .
Thanks , no . I don &apos;t really do organised .
Well , that &apos;s all right . I don &apos;t really do illegal .
If you change your mind , you know where to find us .
Just ask for the comm@@ une .
Enjoy your le@@ af@@ lets !
Clo@@ thes from a clothes shop ? Who &apos;d have thought ?

That went very well .
Thank you , Rob@@ in .
Lord B@@ ly and Miss Jones , of course .
You did very well indeed . It was extremely clear .
I really enjoyed my time in the pa@@ ge@@ ant .
I don &apos;t know what she &apos;s talking about .
This re@@ hear@@ sal is your chance to get it right .
Because if you fall flat on your face down this hole or that hole on the night ,
Is@@ n &apos;t that right , C@@ live ?
That is correct .
What I need you all to do now is to make a line all along here ,
Alphab@@ e@@ tical order , please . Come on , hur@@ ry , hur@@ ry .
Not on the stage , dar@@ ling , please .
Get her off the stage , C@@ live .
G@@ ot it into his head he was going to make a movie star out of her .
It turned out she didn &apos;t have the least ap@@ titude for it .
She &apos;s still in California , as a matter of fact .
Though what she lives off , Lord alone knows .
I supp@@ ose she found herself a sugar d@@ ad@@ dy somewhere .
I &apos;m sure she was grateful for the break . I know I am .
How &apos;s my script coming , Arch@@ ie ?
We were thinking we could make something of the fact

It &apos;s a bit ni@@ che .
You might want to re@@ think .
Or at least re@@ focus .
Mr Miss World .

The man who invented this competition . That &apos;s his wife .
On the night , this area will be shut down ,
We &apos;re making sure we keep on top of every situation .
We &apos;d in@@ filtr@@ ate the theatre .
I don &apos;t get what she &apos;s talking about .
What does that mean ?
A planned invasion .
What do you mean , in@@ filtr@@ ate ? Do you mean go inside ?
Why not ? That &apos;s where the cameras will be .
It &apos;s probably against the law , for a start .
They &apos;re turning op@@ pression into a spectac@@ le .
Let &apos;s make a spectac@@ le of our own .
We &apos;d still demonstrate outside ?
Of course . We &apos;d just have an action inside as well .
Who &apos;d be prepared to go inside ?
H@@ old on . How do we actually get in without being caught ?
We &apos;d buy tickets .
Un@@ less that &apos;s too organised .
And you lot would .. you &apos;d have to blend in .
Commun@@ al clothes .
Oh , I love them .
No . You look like a bag lady .
What ? I look like you . It &apos;s what you &apos;re wearing .
This is your sk@@ irt .
I think we &apos;re gon@@ na win .
You couldn &apos;t even get a bank account without D@@ ad &apos;s permission .
The doctor wouldn &apos;t give you birth control .
That was one bank manager and one doctor .
Just because you swal@@ lowed it doesn &apos;t mean I have to .
Do you know what really makes me lau@@ gh about all this ?
You fighting for women &apos;s rights when you always took your father &apos;s side .

He smo@@ ked c@@ igar@@ ettes and went in ta@@ xis and had adv@@ entures .

And let &apos;s just say , hypo@@ the@@ tically ,
So we do this thing with Pad@@ dy
A sort of &quot; Sorry for fu@@ cking you over &quot; money . Hu@@ h ?
Oh . Hi , little girl . What &apos;s your name ?
Rob@@ in .
Oh y@@ e@@ ah ? Very cute .
Ge@@ e , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe &apos; cause you just kno@@ cked over a nin@@ e-@@ year-old little Chinese girl .
There &apos;s supposed to be a code , Nick@@ y !
You never pre@@ y upon the virtu@@ ous or the poor .
You never put the pay@@ check over your honor .
And you never , ever betra@@ y your family !
There is no angle .
There &apos;s always an angle with you , man .
You &apos;re always h@@ ed@@ ging , you &apos;re always working it .
You think this is about money , C@@ run@@ ch ?
Well , I got news for you .
Think again .
Got@@ ta be a cheaper way to do this .
Just because he says he &apos;s sorry doesn &apos;t make him a changed man .
Like just &apos; cause you like being dr@@ unk doesn &apos;t make you an alco@@ ho@@ lic .
C@@ run@@ ch ! We need the money . How are we gon@@ na pay our b@@ ills ?
Wo@@ w ! She &apos;s good .
Oh . So , so you made her do this ?
No . C@@ run@@ ch needs this .
He needs me
Oh . Well , what I understand is that ,
Well , he needs someone to stop him from taking di@@ ves for $ 800 .
Take care .
All right . I &apos;ll do it . But this one we do my way .
What did ya have in mind ?
Well , let &apos;s just say things are gon@@ na get a little loud .
That &apos;s where the motorcycle k@@ icks in
And Nick@@ y &apos;s already dealt with the main gate
In and out in 4.@@ 25 minutes .
This may be the worst idea in the history of the world .
There &apos;s no du@@ de who can feed a video loop to make some security guard
And as for your Tro@@ jan Horse thing ,
I actually thought that was kind of b@@ ad-@@ ass .
Par@@ don me , you are who ?
He &apos;s my ap@@ pr@@ enti@@ ce
Ah , fu@@ ck you , Nick@@ y .
Look , the Re@@ ver@@ end &apos;s got som@@ ebo@@ dy on the inside .
And we need to find out who that is . Un@@ cle Pad@@ dy ,
What time is it in France ?
Hello ?
Ye@@ ah , Gu@@ y , it &apos;s Nick@@ y .
I do not know you , Nick@@ y .
The son@@ -@@ of-@@ a-@@ b@@ itch hung up on me .
H@@ m . America Light .
OK , you want to throw things ? Th@@ row things , OK !
I don &apos;t give a sh@@ it ! Mo@@ ther@@ fu@@ ck !
OK . OK . No , be careful with that . No , don &apos;t do that , OK ?
I want to see the piece of paper that says you can go through that !
And you know it and you know it !
I thought we had a 10
Ten thir@@ ty-@@ two ? You trying to im@@ press me with numbers ?
I &apos;ll give you an impressive number : 52
I got a number for you : one ,
When I was ten or 11 ,
And I saw an object that ble@@ w my mind .
It was a drinking cup fashi@@ oned from a single piece of j@@ ade .
It was just a cup , but it was perfect .
And it made me look at everything differently .
Tur@@ ner , Mon@@ et , Ver@@ meer , those guys kept my eyes open .
It was a feeling I had , a complet@@ eness when art touched me .
I only started getting into trouble when I wanted to possess it .
And you .... what makes you do it ?
Money
It &apos;s always nice to know ...
who you can trust .
I &apos;m gon@@ na find this painting .
Not because I want to get you or your brother in trouble .
I just want to hold it .
Let me ask you a question .
You ever seen the inside of Sing@@ -S@@ ing ?
Are you h@@ itting on me ?
I will
It &apos;s been a breath of fresh air .
Looking good , Sam .
Inter@@ pol ? Fu@@ cking Inter@@ pol ? !
I &apos;m not going to fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; prison ! I &apos;m not cut out for that sh@@ it !
You see these fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; arms , man ?
These wet no@@ od@@ les will prevent very few prison rap@@ es .
Franc@@ ie , I promise you on my mother &apos;s eyes ,
You got@@ ta trust me . Look , ever since I &apos;ve been back ,
Now ... I might have to t@@ oss in the &quot; f &quot; word here
OK , my turn .
That has to be Gu@@ y .
All right , Gu@@ y just land@@ ed and we got a little problem .
Inter@@ pol .
The to@@ ad is in the hole .
What the fu@@ ck are you talking about ?
The fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; huge vag@@ ina is in the border station now .
Because of C@@ run@@ ch &apos;s record , Inter@@ pol will be brought in .
But , since no crime has been committed , they can &apos;t touch us .
What the hell am I looking at ?
It &apos;s four foot high and star@@ ing you in the face .
And on the day , what about Inter@@ pol ?
They &apos;re going to be watching us , which we need to fix .
Just trust me for a second . Don &apos;t switch the engine on .
Seri@@ ously , what are we doing ? Why do I listen to you ?
You &apos;re being dist@@ rac@@ ted
The border . They &apos;re at the border .
They stopped following US .
P@@ ick up . Come on , pick up .
Two minutes away . Come on !
H@@ ey ! H@@ ey ! Here we go . Here we go .
Att@@ a boy , C@@ run@@ ch !
All right , just like the old days .
Ye@@ ah , the old days where you thre@@ w me to the c@@ ops ?
Or the old days where a one-@@ e@@ yed pir@@ ate ste@@ als my bike ?
U@@ h , u@@ h , u@@ h . Now , now , gentlemen .
OK , but don &apos;t the A@@ mis@@ h ride horse and car@@ ri@@ ages ?
Well , you &apos;re progressive .
I can &apos;t fu@@ cking do this !
Well , you better get your best Bran@@ do on , h@@ oss , &apos; cause we need you .
Ye@@ ah , look , Franc@@ ie , it &apos;s not The King &apos;s Spe@@ ech .
Come here . You got two lines :
I &apos;ll meet him there .
Oh . Will you ?
Ye@@ ah . H@@ ey , look , som@@ ebo@@ dy &apos;s got to be in Detroit
Do you often feel that your life is just passing you by ?
I cannot even be in the same room as you !
OK . OK , Franc@@ ie .
I got an idea .
I think we can make a lot more money off that Gospel
O@@ I . I fail to see how that makes us rich
Great . Par@@ allel . Hot interested
Un@@ cle Pad@@ dy can come up with at least ten more bu@@ yers .
And we can get Gu@@ y to duplic@@ ate a book for each one of them .
We contact the gallery , we let them know their book is st@@ olen .
The news hits the paper and boo@@ m .
Meanwhile we ship off ten copies to ten bu@@ yers .
Each one thinks they have the original .
Go@@ d@@ dam@@ n it if it &apos;s not perfect .
U@@ h@@ h ! I just need to tell you something
Well , y@@ e@@ ah , I didn &apos;t mind Pre@@ dat@@ or Two .
It &apos;s not bad . Its OK . D@@ anny Glo@@ ver .
You can &apos;t go wrong . No .
Bre@@ ak a leg .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah ! Thank you .
Come on !
I &apos;m never doing this sh@@ it again !
You mo@@ ther@@ fu@@ cker ! No , no ! H@@ old on !
What the fu@@ ck is this ! Come on !
Fu@@ ck you ! H@@ old on ! H@@ ey !
Fu@@ ck the both of you !
I think he paid like three grand for the whole place .
He over@@ paid .
This is a golden opportunity . I &apos;m not doing this for me .
You know I &apos;m fl@@ ush . I &apos;m doing this for you .
We &apos;re dro@@ pping this off , we &apos;re making a hell of a dec@@ ent score here .
And in five minutes we &apos;re going home .
OK . Where do we find the money to pay for these f@@ akes ?
It cost Gu@@ y ten grand to f@@ ake one .
These f@@ akes would have to stand up to carbon dating
Ten grand a book , that &apos;s a hundred grand . I can front it .
You got a 100 grand la@@ ying around , Nick@@ y ?
Yes , I Co .
You know , I gu@@ ess this is it .
This could have been big .
We could have made history .
Dam@@ n it .
All right , let &apos;s go down@@ stairs and talk about it .
A million per book . Ten million bu@@ cks , guys .
Ten bu@@ yers , I can find . Maybe more .
No , no , no . Let &apos;s stick with ten . Let &apos;s not get gre@@ edy here .
Gu@@ y , when can you get started ?
Today . Now .
It will take me maybe three weeks ... No , one month .
I just need money .
OK , 100 grand , that &apos;s covered .
Oh , no , no , no , no , no .
Seven hundred , fif@@ ty thousand , minimum .
You just made one for ten thousand .
No . I made the cover for ten grand . The pages are total sh@@ it .
And if you want these to pass the carbon dating and the professional sc@@ rut@@ iny ,
Do we need to carbon date them ?
With our bu@@ yers , most certainly .
That &apos;s it , man . Let &apos;s go take it back .
All right , look .
I could come up with about $ 300@@ ,000 .
If there was ever a reason to mortgage your home ..
Oh , no , no , no , no , man . I &apos;m not doing that .
No , not the house . That &apos;s all I got .
If we pull this off , you can buy ten of &apos; em .
Look , man , I just .... . Look , I don &apos;t know , OK ?
Listen , I got@@ ta think about it . I w@@ anna run it by L@@ ola .
Well , don &apos;t take too long . We don &apos;t have time to lose .
Don &apos;t talk to me about lost time , Nick@@ y .
I know what you want .
Ah , Jesus Mur@@ phy .
Ah , you waste no time .
What can I say ? I &apos;m excited .
OK . Great , we &apos;re all here .
So , starting tomorrow , there &apos;ll be no contact .
During that time period Pad@@ dy will have made the sales ,
And L@@ ola will be handling the money .
In a month &apos;s time , we &apos;ll contact Amsterdam ,
H@@ a . The Re@@ ver@@ end &apos;s gon@@ na be some p@@ is@@ sed .
Here &apos;s a key to the building .
All right .
Gu@@ y &apos;s books will be perfect .
They &apos;ll pass carbon dating , expert analysis , everything .
However , your copies , they won &apos;t need any of that carbon dating cra@@ p .
They &apos;ll just need to look convinc@@ ing
Why bo@@ ther getting all that proper paper for Gu@@ y &apos;s books ?
Why .. why bo@@ ther working that lot at all ?
Because I plan on sending your ten copies of the book
This way , you and I can split it two ways
I see . Family &apos;s family , but money &apos;s money , eh ?
Ye@@ ah , well , let me tell you something about family .
C@@ run@@ ch would do the same dam@@ n thing if he had any bra@@ ins in his head .
Ye@@ ah , but then he delivers his books
But then they &apos;re gon@@ na come after you , my fine ch@@ um .
I won &apos;t be around .
Later , C@@ run@@ ch ! There &apos;s got@@ ta be like ...
Fu@@ ck !
ten experts in the country
Ol@@ ga Some@@ thing
It &apos;s Nick@@ y Cal@@ hou@@ n .
Have you ... Have you seen Pad@@ dy ?
What ?
Did you fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; see Pad@@ dy ?
He left a couple of days ago .
What about the Gospel ? Did Cust@@ oms ask you to look at the Gospel ?
Gospel ? The fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; Gospel According to James !
Did they ask you to look at it ?
W@@ ha@@ c ?
And that is the story of the the@@ ft of the Mon@@ a Lisa .
You just took five and half of the best years of my life away , Nick@@ y .
Nick@@ y Boy ,
If we weren &apos;t , we &apos;d just spend all our time
All I did was drop off a sculpture .
And then picked it on up .
I just needed to plant the idea and let his imagination do the rest .
Saturday , ten AM . Gu@@ y walks into the border station .
I don &apos;t need a warran@@ t .
I &apos;m not a co@@ p . But these guys are .
Dom@@ en@@ ic Cal@@ hou@@ n , we &apos;ve received information
Look who we have here .
Geor@@ ges Se@@ ur@@ at .
&quot; Model , R@@ ear@@ -@@ View , &quot; 188@@ 7 .
I need you to find something for me .
Un@@ cle Pad@@ dy could come up with ten bu@@ yers easily .
Ten bu@@ yers I can find , maybe more .
You see , all he needed was the news of the the@@ ft .
Pad@@ dy Mc@@ Car@@ thy here . I got a piece you might be interested in .
That Geor@@ ges Se@@ ur@@ at !
This is all about the Se@@ ur@@ at .
This has nothing to do with Nick@@ y &apos;s painting
We still need four hundred and fif@@ ty .
I can pull together a hundred thousand .
Cut the cra@@ p . We know where you were .
We know what you were doing .
Ye@@ ah , I just told you . I was at CV@@ S breathing my ass off .
Oh , you were breathing , all right .
You were breathing the r@@ are@@ fied air of celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
Then why are you tre@@ m@@ bling ?
I &apos;m always tre@@ m@@ bling .
We saw you on Instagram .
We just want to know how you got invited .
I can &apos;t talk about it or they won &apos;t invite me back next week .
So there &apos;s another game next week .
I didn &apos;t mean to say that .
Who &apos;s in it ?
I can &apos;t tell you !
How do we get invited ?
I don &apos;t know !
With William Sh@@ at@@ ner ?
And you didn &apos;t tell us ?
I &apos;m sorry . W@@ il made me promise not to .
I thought we were friends .
Oh , come on , you guys would do the same thing .
No , we wouldn &apos;t ! I told you when I was
It didn &apos;t even turn out to be S@@ car@@ l@@ ett Joh@@ ans@@ son .
Well , that &apos;s her fault , not mine !
It doesn &apos;t matter
So there &apos;s an open seat .
W@@ il ! W@@ il Whe@@ aton !
Open ! Open !
No . No . No .
Hell no .
Look , we know Leon@@ ard is out . You need to fill a seat .
Pass@@ engers ...
This is not a shoe .
This is dis@@ order .
This is size 10 cha@@ os .
This , you see this ? This is death .
In this locom@@ otive we call home , there is one thing
Order is the barrier that holds back the cold and death .
We must all of us , on this train of life ..
Would you wear a shoe on your head ?
Of course you wouldn &apos;t wear a shoe on your head .
A shoe doesn &apos;t belong in your head .
A shoe belongs on your foot
I am a hat , you are a shoe .
I belong on the head , you belong on the foot .
Yes ? So it is .
In the beginning , order was prescri@@ bed by your ticket .
Hello ? Andrew .
Andrew !

When you dream too much of the sun , you forget the trees .
I believe this is your son .

If you look very deep into the eyes ,

We &apos;ve lost hydrau@@ lics .
We &apos;ve lost our hydrau@@ lics and it feels like our pitch control .
South@@ Jet 2@@ 27 , Atlanta ...
Turn on the backup pumps . The backup pumps .
That is affir@@ m . We are in an un@@ controlled ..

We &apos;re decl@@ aring an emergency .
We &apos;ve d@@ ump@@ ed our fuel .
We &apos;ve got a j@@ ammed stabili@@ zer or something .
We need a block of altitude to work the problem
And they &apos;re keeping him in a com@@ a just to let the brain sw@@ elling go down ,
He &apos;s going to be ok@@ ay .
What are you doing here , Charlie ?
I &apos;m flying a desk now .

You &apos;re the re@@ p for the pil@@ ots &apos; union ?
Ye@@ ah , I &apos;m one of them . When your plane went down ,
I &apos;m glad you &apos;re here .
The union &apos;s gon@@ na release a statement on your behalf ,

And I know you and De@@ ana have been divor@@ ced for a while now ,
Ye@@ ah , K@@ nu@@ ck@@ les , u@@ h ...

On second thought , just bring the boo@@ ze ,

Listen , I thought we &apos;d take a ride .
There &apos;s something I need to show you .
Ok@@ ay .
There it is .
You can see on initial impact , the left wing hit the ground .
Think if it would have sh@@ ear@@ ed off completely ,
You can &apos;t drink , Captain .
You &apos;re under the micro@@ scope right now .
You can &apos;t be seen buying liqu@@ or .
That means no bars , no drugs ..
I understand . I won &apos;t drink , I promise you .
Every@@ body in Georgia likes bas@@ eball .
The whole country likes bas@@ eball .
Cut the cra@@ p .
So , what &apos;s the deal , L@@ enny ?
Is your union going to survive this one ?
More import@@ antly , how big a check you think I &apos;m gon@@ na have to write ?
I &apos;m wearing nothing but my girlfriend &apos;s pan@@ ties ,
And I say to them , &quot; U@@ h , I might have had two be@@ ers . &quot;
Have I gone off format ?
My name is Bar@@ ry and I am an alco@@ ho@@ lic .
Hi , Bar@@ ry .

That audio is tra@@ gic and comp@@ elling .
I chose to play that part of the cock@@ pit recording
I &apos;m not sure if it was conscious . But .
it was more like inst@@ inc@@ t .
What led to that decision ?
I don &apos;t rec@@ all .
Let me quote from an investig@@ ative summary .
&quot; From 9 : 34 until 9 : 42 ,
We pit@@ ched nose down .
First Officer Ev@@ ans &apos; testimony confirms the same .
I want to show you something .
Nothing &apos;s happening .
This remote isn &apos;t working .
Ap@@ ologies . I can do this manually .
We can not choose our gifts . Al@@ low me ? D@@ ont be sh@@ y

Inter@@ esting teeth marks .
I see that you &apos;re a writer ..
from Phoenix , Mont@@ ana .
You came here to be inspired by the English countryside ..
and escape from your busy life in the US
Absol@@ utely not . No .
Another try . Just one .
I see what went wrong . It is very clear now .
I see a dark past .
We &apos;ll even let Mrs. Ev@@ ans show how you dress .
I would let her do , but we are here ton@@ ight
I know all the words to &quot; Green E@@ ov@@ s and H@@ am &quot;
One of these books is also good , but you must read loud and clear .
Yes of course .
And now his choice of music .
You have to sit up . Like a good boy .
Music .
Brah@@ ms can not live without his music . II is his world
he enjoys it so much that I do not d@@ are to hold him off
That is , we fight constantly against nature ..
the weather , the plants and p@@ ests . Especially p@@ ests .
And so we have to take certain measures against them .
Hello my love .
Mr. J@@ ol@@ ly Sh@@ ire will explain the rest of your tasks .
The food is here
We do our best to maintain the hou@@ se@@ . use the fireplace anymore .
Dan@@ gerous . And s@@ adly , our last cra@@ fts@@ man ...
windows painted shut .
Person@@ ally I do not need all this , but
And Brah@@ ms was never crazy about animals .
He was always quite sh@@ y .
Very tim@@ id .
I do not know how this looks to you and to be honest .
I do not know how it got this far .
Little by little , and then all at once
our son is here . He is truly with us .
Good . That is very 2@@ ood .
Dear Jesus , me@@ ek and mild , watch over this small child .
For@@ give my mistakes and let me come with you .
God bl@@ ess M@@ omm@@ y . God bl@@ ess dad .
God bl@@ ess Gre@@ ta
You beha@@ ved like a little gent@@ lem@@ an .
M@@ omm@@ y is so proud of you .
Would you give us some time to talk to Brah@@ ms ?
Of course .
He wants you . He has chosen you as you want .
I do not know . This is so cre@@ ep@@ y .
A huge house in lim@@ bo . No neighb@@ ors .
There was a fire and Brah@@ ms did not survive .
On his eigh@@ th birthday . So sad
It must seem strange . It is also very strange .
It is innocent .
Their way of dealing with it .
I can not imagine what it &apos;s like to lose a child .
So he died 20 years ago ? He might have about your age .
They live so for 20 years ?
And searching for a year for a n@@ anny .
You will probably crazy in this house ?
It might be good to get out@@ .I can show u our world-@@ famous night .
I know you Brah@@ ms can not leave , but I will not tell
No , you can believe me . This is a ...
professional cour@@ tes@@ y because we work for the same people .
It is a duty . I will absolutely not enjoy it , I promise .
There do two stories in this city .
There is the poli@@ te story and rum@@ ors .
And the truth lies somewhere in the middle .
What is the poli@@ te story ?
He was a nice guy and it is a p@@ ity that he died so young
He was not such a nice boy .
He was really very strange .
Yes , you can trust them .
Thus , it is not . He did not come here to check the whole house .
Watch out . You &apos;ll wake up in the middle of the night ...
he &apos;ll be standing over you in your cor@@ al dress ...
and lip@@ stick all over his face .
I &apos;m serious .
There are really bad people out there in this world .
Unfortunately , you should know that better than most
Col@@ e told him some story about wanted
He did not know how else to him to come off , he is ten years .
I have to say sorry because I have you here in question .
Do not say that , we are family .
And you &apos;ve done nothing wrong .
What happened was his fault . What he has taken from you .
I will not read what that b@@ ast@@ ard sends me .
Everything happens for a reason .
Hello .
I decided to take the stuff to make this week a little earlier .
I can come back if you ...
No , I was not exp@@ ecting . That &apos;s all .
I brought the mail .
Are you sure everything &apos;s ok@@ ay ?
Ye@@ ah
You and Brah@@ ms get along well with each other .
I do not think I should .
Why not ?
You should not worry about Brah@@ ms .
You think do not mind , you old n@@ ag .
Of course not . I was hop@@ ing she would go . I want some privacy .
I watch television and take a bath . A little Brah@@ ms time
Maybe another time .
Ye@@ ah , maybe some other time .
I go again .
Do you hear me ?
Here is your food .
If there is a spirit in this house , give me a sign .
St@@ up@@ id .
I &apos;m sorry I let you all come back@@ .@@ Is everything al@@ right ?
want someone else sees this .
And when I found out I was pregnant .
He s@@ wor@@ e that he would change .
That he was sorry .
And I believed him .
One day he started again and ...
my sister took me to the hospital .
But I knew I &apos;d lost the baby .
What I &apos;m trying to say is that I .
I know how it feels to lose a child .
What in hell is going on ?
You &apos;ll damage your ears , sil@@ ly boy .
Why are you doing this ?
After this , you might sleep better ton@@ ight in the village .
What just happened ..
that music .
That was not .
Children have tan@@ tr@@ ums . It was a tan@@ trum
Let &apos;s take a step back in order to think about .
It is not necessary .
I know exactly what &apos;s going on . I am going no@@ where .
Ms. J@@ ol@@ ly Sh@@ ire ask me to look after him . I am going to do .
They &apos;ll understand it in this case .
They chose me . They want me to stay here
Dam@@ n .
I should have told you this before .
but I didn &apos;t want to sc@@ are you off .
Once a week , came here to play a little girl
And on his birthday she comes out but never makes it home .
Event@@ ually found her cor@@ p@@ se in the woods . Her sk@@ ull was sm@@ ashed .
What do you think all that stuff d@@ oll@@ s ?
I do not know . I try not to inter@@ f@@ ere in other people &apos;s affairs .
Sen@@ sible man .
I have the stuff at me , do you want to see if everything is there .
Yes of course . I &apos;ll be right back .
But I want you to know ...
you do not leave me .
I will not let you g@@ 0 , no matter where your flight back .
Do you understand ?
Go pack so you &apos;re ready tomorrow .
Do not worry , I will not leave you .
But I need your help .
Come here .
Do not play games with me . Who could have done it differently ?
There is nobody else in this house .
The dol@@ l
Do not m@@ ess with me
You did not do it .
1@@ t was the dol@@ l
Maybe you left it message for me .
Or are you going to say that it was the dol@@ l ? What did Brah@@ ms ?
You do not understand what is happening . The dol@@ l .
No . I think I understand exactly what &apos;s going on .
Give me the dol@@ l . What &apos;s so special about that dol@@ l ?
Wa@@ it , you &apos;re gon@@ na fall .

It is an honor to meet you , Master P@@ anda .
Perhaps your father would care to join us in the training hall ?
Your son will be teaching the class .
Look . I@@ it &apos;s you .
P@@ o , focus !
Message from the universe . I &apos;ll give you one message from the universe ..
Stay away from my son .
Sorry dad . I &apos;ll clean it up later .

Which one ? They &apos;re all talking
We should try that , too . Maybe it &apos;d be sc@@ ary back at them .
Ok@@ ay , but we got@@ ta plan what we &apos;re gon@@ na say first ,
There &apos;s so much wisdom in here , I can &apos;t find anything
Behold .
All the answers will be found within
Wa@@ it , wait . H@@ old on . Sorry , ok@@ ay , here we go .

He saw that what could be given could also be taken .
I had to stop him .
Our battle sh@@ ook the Earth .
We have to make a way to stop him .
He gets more more powerful with every Master he defe@@ ats .
There is no choice . We fight .
I can teach you , son .
You can do this ?
Of course , I &apos;m a p@@ anda .
That must be why the universe sent you here .
Ok@@ ay , so what do I have to do ?
You must re@@ discover what it is to be a p@@ anda .
You have to earn how to live like a p@@ anda . Sle@@ ep like a p@@ anda .
E@@ at like a p@@ anda .
Those 103 dum@@ pl@@ ings ? I was just warming up .
I &apos;ve always felt like I wasn &apos;t eating up to my full potential .
You can &apos;t take P@@ o away from me . No , no I want a second opinion .

Oh , just like my P@@ o .
No , you can &apos;t !
But you don &apos;t have to be .
That &apos;s what Shi@@ fu meant . I don &apos;t have to turn you into me .
I have to turn you into you !
That doesn &apos;t make any sense .
I know !
Thanks , d@@ ads . You &apos;re welcome ?
I &apos;m gon@@ na do something I never thought I &apos;d be able to do .

Our cost@@ umes are in the back .
Phi@@ l and I are going to Her@@ o-@@ C@@ on
Um , I-@@ I &apos;ve always wanted to go ,
So I &apos;ve asked Phi@@ l to keep it between us .
That &apos;s why we chose our secret war@@ ri@@ or signal .
My first sugges@@ tion was to b@@ low a Vi@@ king horn .
Don &apos;t ever Google that , by the way .
I already did .
This year , there &apos;s a panel , um , on our favorite show ,

I was angry . I needed to take a walk
You want to take another lap ?
D@@ ad , I am right about this .
Event@@ ually Nick is gon@@ na figure out how to keep up with demand ,
I know your style has always been just tough it out
You &apos;re right . We can &apos;t beat these guys .
A mer@@ ger &apos;s the only long-term play .
I just don &apos;t know who I am in there .
What ?
They &apos;re all 25 , zi@@ pp@@ in &apos; around on their ...
The show took on corporate spon@@ sors in season four .
Seri@@ ously , Gary ?
I helped you build a deck !
Ok@@ ay , stop , stop it ! What are we doing , hu@@ h ?

Actually , we &apos;re quite war@@ -@@ like .
Look , look , this man , he made a mistake ,
Do you both remember the secret plan ?
I &apos;ve got it all right here . When do I tell the queen the secret ?
You must be patient , Th@@ ist@@ le@@ w@@ it .
Do you think Queen Aur@@ ora &apos;s aw@@ ake yet ?
Well , she &apos;s not &quot; Sle@@ eping Beauty &quot; anymore .
I see what you did there .
Next item of business , the missing fa@@ iries .
I &apos;ve sent more sp@@ rit@@ es to search the Tom@@ b Blo@@ om field .
They &apos;ll report back to me at night@@ fall .
We will keep searching until we find them .
Please don &apos;t raise your roots at me , Lie@@ f .
Cr@@ ushing humans with branches is not going to help .
Please , leave His Maj@@ est@@ y his dignity .
We all saw what Mal@@ ef@@ ic@@ ent did to him .
I &apos;m so sorry .
A cur@@ se upon our king is a cur@@ se upon this kingdom .
All he wanted was peace .
This is all my fault .
You have nothing to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for , my dear .
No one &apos;s seen her .
I &apos;m so happy to see you .
She &apos;s no@@ where to be found .
What if she never comes back ?
I could be stuck as a human forever .
I have to find her .
She &apos;s the only one who can break the cur@@ se .
Tell me she &apos;s dead .
The iron p@@ ier@@ ced her flesh .
She fell into the river and went over the falls .
Then where is her head ?
There was something else .
Another cre@@ ature .
It pulled her from the dep@@ ths of the sea .
What did it look like ?
Her .
It carried her up into the sky .
A wounded animal las@@ h@@ es out and now she &apos;s not alone .
We must be ready for war .
If Con@@ all h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t found her , she would be dead .
They tried to kill her with this .
Do you hear it ?
It &apos;s a message from the humans .
I hear it loud and clear .
Time for us to die .
Hum@@ ans have used iron against us for centuries .
And we are almost ext@@ inc@@ t because of it .
K@@ illing peas@@ ants on the Mo@@ ors will only lead to more conflict , Bor@@ ra .
They &apos;ve pulled the iron from the earth ...
made their s@@ words and shi@@ el@@ ds , drove us underground .
But this ...
This will finish us .
Our people are safe here for now .
But for how long ?
The humans will find us . They will not stop .
I call for war .
Right now !
There are too many humans .
To@@ o many k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms .
This is where we bury our dead .
They &apos;ve destroyed it .
This is what the humans do .
They &apos;re nothing but loc@@ ust@@ s that s@@ warm the earth .
We have to stop them .
You spent years car@@ ing for a human ...
now it &apos;s time to care for your own .
I mean , snow@@ boards are just too em@@ o for me .
Those things are a f@@ ad . In 10 years they &apos;ll be gone .
Ye@@ ah , that &apos;s what they said about ra@@ p .
That &apos;s true .
can you guys smell that fresh mountain air ?
It sm@@ ells a bit like ...
cancer .
Why am I friends with you ?
I don &apos;t know .
Here , give me a drag .
Do you guys know when we &apos;re gon@@ na get back ?
&apos;@@ cause I &apos;ve got like two weeks worth of chap@@ ters to read .
Oh come on . She broke the first rule .
You can &apos;t talk about real life sh@@ it while we &apos;re up here .
The whole point of being here is to forget about all that sh@@ it ,
Ok@@ ay .
Deal with that sh@@ it when you get home .
Ok@@ ay , but I &apos;ve got ...

Well , thank you for your help .
I &apos;m really sorry about that .

Just remember 8@@ 30 .
Just one more time , please ?
Sorry .
I &apos;d give you more money but I gave it all to you .
H@@ ey , you got a pen ?
It &apos;s not about the money . We got weather coming in .
We &apos;re trying to clear the mountain . There &apos;s nothing I can do .
Ok@@ ay , what if we run straight down ? Like the quick@@ est run ever ?
We &apos;ll be , like , wick@@ ed fast .
We gave you 100 bu@@ cks .
come on .
Please ?
Seri@@ ously , for 100 bu@@ cks you &apos;d figure the guy would cut us some sl@@ ack .
No sh@@ it .
I thought they were open till 10 : 00 on Sun@@ days .
What ever happened to night skiing ?
Wach@@ us@@ ett &apos;s got night skiing . Should have gone there .

My father , he says , &quot; Listen .
He knows how difficult it is , even with a beautiful voice .
And I say , &quot; Ok@@ ay , if you say so , I will do that . &quot;
So , in 1955 , I begin to study ,
So , how did you get your first part in an opera ?
I won a competition ,
And my debut was the 29@@ th of April , 1961 ,
I remember that we have the room , one in front of the other ,
It &apos;s love . It &apos;s passion . It &apos;s very beautiful . It &apos;s cas@@ ual .
It &apos;s everything po@@ etic and romantic and positive in life .
And desper@@ ate , because there is@@ . that is there .
London is an incredible city ,
I sang there in 1963 with great success .
But to become a ten@@ or , that &apos;s another thing . It &apos;s more un@@ natural .
If you want to become Luci@@ ano Pav@@ ar@@ ot@@ ti ,
That &apos;s the most important thing .
You can have a beautiful , nice life of the ten@@ or ,
When I was listening to Luci@@ ano , you know ,
Everything .. Everything was easy .
I felt like I could see his voice .
It was super clear , like a phot@@ ograph .
You can count molecules practically . It &apos;s so clear .
A ten@@ or singing a high C makes your ears vibr@@ ate .
There &apos;s such tension of sound . My ears would ring .
We all dre@@ amed to be the most important in the oper@@ atic world .
Luci@@ ano was the one and only . Yes .
When I was born in this building ,
So I was the first boy after six years
M@@ v mother emb@@ rac@@ ed me , and with all the women of this house ,
Every@@ body was looking for me .
I was very much spo@@ iled , loved , but even .. kept smart .
I think Luci@@ ano loved women . And he also trusted them .
Ti@@ b@@ or made a career with Luci@@ ano , taking him into sta@@ di@@ ums ,
Su@@ ddenly , in between my relationship
He said , &quot; Any@@ thing you do from here on in ,
That was certainly an important point
He was bran@@ ching out .
Everything became more ge@@ ared towards mass appeal .
I feel ... It &apos;s almost ... The feeling is that , eh ?
Ye@@ ah .
I thought they will have arguments who will sing which aria .
There &apos;s so much re@@ pertoire .
So we all re@@ hear@@ sed it on the spot .
One of us suggested , &quot; Why don &apos;t you do this one and I do that ? &quot;
So , we divi@@ de some of the numbers .
So , to pick , you know , between the s@@ add@@ est and so and so .
I think a good way to know a person
You know what kind of determination , you know what kind of fears
U@@ h , the moment of being on the stage ,
It was ok@@ ay , like , &quot; Any@@ thing you do , I can do better . &quot;
.. spirit of the moment , you know ?
&quot; Boy , what a phrase you did . Now let me do this one . &quot;
But , u@@ h , we end the program ,
It &apos;s kind of hard to over@@ state what an impact that had .
It was like a ti@@ dal wave .
The Three Ten@@ ors transformed three guys
All of a sudden , classical departments
It &apos;s dis@@ gu@@ sting .
At the age of 60 , he sh@@ ouldn &apos;t do such things .
Well , he was the most famous Catholic
Di@@ vor@@ ce at that time was un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .
So they would de@@ vote quite a lot of the paper to it .
In Italy , this story played out for years .
These days ,
Men have four or five wi@@ ves .
There is no respect .
So , at the beginning , I spent ,
I should &apos;ve said , &quot; You are wa@@ sting time . &quot;
And while Mrs. Pav@@ ar@@ ot@@ ti is in sec@@ lu@@ sion ,
It was bad because , u@@ h , I was suffering myself .
But my wife suffered more .
But they understand that I fell in love .
He caught it-@@ in the neck for@@ -@@ Pav@@ ar@@ ot@@ ti the pop star .
And now falling in love ... .. he caught it in the neck again .
And now@@ -@@ falling in love ... ... h@@ e-@@ cau@@ gh@@ t-@@ it in the neck again .
A@@ w , je@@ ez .
O@@ oh . Gu@@ y must &apos;ve been a h@@ unter .
Wa@@ it . T@@ oh@@ n .
Did I hear you say that you thought that she looked like Am@@ ber ?
Ye@@ ah . John , Am@@ ber &apos;s almost as tall as me .
Like , just under six feet , blonde hair , kin@@ da top-@@ heavy .
Ye@@ ah , I know . She &apos;s cute as hell , right ?
Ye@@ ah , and you think that Shel@@ ly looks like her ?
The girl sitting up@@ stairs ?
Ye@@ ah .
John , Shel@@ ly &apos;s short .
Short with dark hair ,
God dam@@ n it . I knew she was too good to be true .
U@@ h , Shel@@ ly .
John and I are having a bit of a problem here .
We &apos;re both seeing completely different versions of you .
Now John here has ey@@ es@@ ight problems
The &quot; check engine &quot; light is fine . It &apos;s still blin@@ king away .
It &apos;s the st@@ up@@ id engine that stopped working .
It cost me like $ 1,@@ 200 to fix it .
You know , it occurs to me you could solve all your problems
Yes , it occurs to me , too .
H@@ ang on a moment .
Here . Take some .
Pay me back when you can .
Penn@@ y , you appear to have a package here .
Oh , thanks .
This must be the ber@@ et I ordered .
A couple of months ago . It was back@@ -@@ ordered .
Did you know the ber@@ et is an example
I pay my own way in this world , ok@@ ay ?
I don &apos;t rely on any@@ body !
What was that about ?
He has a nervous bl@@ ad@@ der when he &apos;s stressed out .
Kind of like a pupp@@ y .
Why not ?
Mo@@ ving is a big deal .
You have to go to the supermarket and get boxes ,
Why don &apos;t you just get a ro@@ omm@@ ate and stay here
Oh , Leon@@ ard , honey , if we started living together ,
Re@@ ally ?
And you thought my acting lessons were a waste of money .
This mo@@ o sh@@ u por@@ k &apos;s burning a hole through my du@@ o@@ den@@ um .
They had a terrible time of it , Leon@@ ard .
Plus , no one st@@ ole their p@@ ants .
Fine . Enjoy your little game .

Ok@@ ay , is everyone clear on the plan ?
Yes . K@@ ooth@@ ra@@ pp@@ ali &apos;s going to wet himself ,
Sh@@ all we synchron@@ ize our watches ?

I wish there was something i could do for her .
I wish i could .
I like st@@ ev@@ ens .
She &apos;s one of the good ones .
I wish there was something i could do for her .
I , um ..
I know something you can do .
I just want you to know that i &apos;m hurt .
I am hurt and i am angry .
Because i thought that we had something .
I thought that we were going somewhere .
If you &apos;re just sleeping around ,
we went to a f@@ ancy restaurant ,
Because i don &apos;t have 75 bu@@ cks
I am broke .
And i am exhau@@ sted , ari@@ zona .
I &apos;m working in the er@@ . because i need the money .
Six people died on my watch today ,

He@@ y. it &apos;s ok@@ ay it &apos;s ok@@ ay@@ . h@@ ey
You saved that girl today as much asi did .
Trau@@ ma &apos;s a team sport , o &apos;@@ mal@@ ley .
You don &apos;t have to be the hero you just .
You just have to go where you &apos;re needed .
Alex ...
You &apos;re gon@@ na be flying solo today .
You can do it . Right , swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ t ?
She &apos;ll be fine .
I &apos;m not sure this is a good idea , A@@ unt St@@ ella .
And now , ladies and gentlemen ...
Wo@@ w . Look at all those drawings .
I always kin@@ da figured you were an artist .
I think we &apos;re all a little ar@@ ts@@ y .
Sometimes I arrange my pop@@ corn
H@@ ey ! Why &apos;d you do that ?
So gentle .
Can you tell what this is ?
Great . Is that a problem ?
No , no .
What , you hate kids or something ?
No . I don &apos;t hate kids .
U@@ h , what , then ?
All right , call the N@@ IC@@ U .
Tell them to have an um@@ bi@@ lical line and vent on stand@@ by .
Ok@@ ay , Lau@@ rie , push , push .
P@@ ush , push . Ok@@ ay .
All right , and now you have little boy .
H@@ ey , you got him ?
Ye@@ ah , I &apos;ll see you in C.@@ T .
Can we hold them ?
Um , y@@ e@@ ah , not just .. not just yet .
A lot .
Why do you think that ?
Because I make a lot more than you .
Ye@@ ah , like a lot more than you .
Like ... like a lot more .
Well , how much ?
Mer@@ edi@@ th .
Give me a number .
I just think , like , can &apos;t you just be civil and rational ?
But she won &apos;t listen to anything I have to say .
Now she &apos;s decided that this is the hill
Of course that hill is my living room , so ...
Ye@@ ah , look , um , y@@ e@@ ah , I &apos;m ... I &apos;m with Rob@@ b@@ ins today ,
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah . Ye@@ ah , y@@ e@@ ah , no , go .
Ok@@ ay .
Ye@@ ah .
H@@ ey , look .
u@@ h .. if , you know ... if you need to get out of there
Oh , no , no . Not a chance .
Thanks , but no . She &apos;s out ton@@ ight .
And we will do everything that we can to find it .
And the rest you put on me .
B@@ ail@@ ey ?
U@@ h , B@@ ail@@ ey did you like this ?
I mean , who knew B@@ ail@@ ey was the man ?
And not because of the kids .
I don &apos;t want that responsibility over a parent .
And , y@@ e@@ ah , maybe th@@ at@@ . maybe that makes me a l@@ ous@@ y doctor ,
But .. I get to decide what I &apos;m best suited for .
Right ?
I mean , don &apos;t I get to decide what kind of doctor I &apos;m gon@@ na be ?
Ye@@ ah , you do .
You have to .
15 blade , please .
And 10 blade .
P@@ ush Bo@@ vie to 30 . More lap p@@ ads .
That &apos;s what I needed to see .
All right , hold on , don &apos;t move .
I need a little more re@@ trac@@ tion .
Good . H@@ old right there .
Do you see where she &apos;s got ..
Wa@@ it , y@@ e@@ ah .
Ye@@ ah .
What do you think ?
Ok@@ ay .
It &apos;s Emma . The liver &apos;s going to Emma .
All right , there you go .
But I need you to do the transp@@ l@@ ant for me .
I want to try a primary res@@ ection on Daniel
at least buy him more time .
Alex .
I want to save them both .
But can the child even with@@ stand ?
I would think that you of all people ..
this hospital &apos;s first female chief of surgery ... .
would fight for a woman to get paid at least as much as any man .
This is about Mer@@ edi@@ th Grey .
I mean , if you do not value her enough , then just ...
It is in@@ appropriate for me to discuss the sal@@ ary
She deser@@ ves more , and you know it .
I do , and don &apos;t ever suggest
You don &apos;t know . I am woman .
H@@ ear me ro@@ ar .
But I &apos;ve already ment@@ ored Grey .
I &apos;ve already taught her what she needs to know .
And now that I &apos;m chief of this hospital ,
And it &apos;s not my job to be giving away money
Let &apos;s get you out of here .
Yes !
Thank you for not changing the lo@@ cks .
Things got a little crazy last night .
Maybe you &apos;re right .
Maybe I &apos;m being a little crazy .
But is it really crazy to try like hell to save
I love you , and if fighting for y ...
When you &apos;re faced with the tough choices ,
What can you live with ?
What can you leave behind ?
Towels are in the bathroom .
Any@@ thing else you need ?
No , no , no . I &apos;m fine , thank you .
Ok@@ ay .
There &apos;s still a lot of ep@@ i@@ dur@@ al ble@@ eding .
Dr. Sh@@ ep@@ herd , when you have a second .
Does it look like I have a second ?
What the hell is the problem ?
They said it &apos;s something about your baby .
She was p@@ inn@@ ed under her car ,
You will work together
Oh , in the O.@@ R. ?
Do you listen to anyone else , ever ? All the time . Just not you .
Or me , apparently .
She &apos;s not ans@@ wering her phone or her p@@ ager .
I haven &apos;t seen her . I was in the pit . She &apos;s not in the pit .
I was in the elevator . She &apos;s not in the elevator .
Page Dr. Grey .
I &apos;m gon@@ na go with really small .
Up the d@@ op@@ am@@ ine to 15 .
Happy now . She &apos;s bot@@ tom@@ ing out .
Well , if we &apos;d get in there and pack the pel@@ vis ,
Well , y@@ e@@ ah , I hope so ,
Because her heart is explo@@ ding .
Ok@@ ay ..
Is this where I step in ?
We need to stabili@@ ze the internal ble@@ eding .
G@@ ot some ble@@ eding in the upper right quad@@ rant .
Give me more su@@ ction and lap p@@ ads .
Do you see any b@@ ile or pan@@ cre@@ atic secre@@ tions ?
N@@ one here .
Neg@@ ative .
H@@ ey , I &apos;m watching Henry &apos;s surgery today .
Why ?
My bad .
What the hell just happened ?
Ep@@ i . Give me another ep@@ i .
Here you go , doctor .
I can &apos;t find a pul@@ se .
Why the hell doesn &apos;t he have a pul@@ se ?
I need a crash cart .
An ep@@ i doesn &apos;t stop a healthy person &apos;s heart .
What did you do ?
I don &apos;t know .
All right . Her heart &apos;s back .
Ok@@ ay .
Have to be careful not to cut too deep
Dr. Web@@ ber .
Yes .
Hi . T@@ eddy Alt@@ man here .
Ye@@ ah , nice to see you .
I-@@ I thought that Dr. B@@ ail@@ ey was just ob@@ serving .
Ye@@ ah , well , she &apos;s here , so she &apos;s gon@@ na make herself useful .
Dr. Web@@ ber , I &apos;m a sur@@ geon .
That &apos;s the word on the street .
You have an atten@@ ding assi@@ sting you
You r@@ ushed Henry into surgery with an hour &apos;s notice .
What ... Wh@@ -@@ what are you not telling me ?
I don &apos;t need to be here .
They just want to observe me
Not a bad idea .
How &apos;d the k@@ id do ?
He has a few sp@@ inal frac@@ tures ,
You need to make up with your friends .
Wh@@ atever .
One of them almost killed you today .
It was an accident .
No@@ body has your back .
No@@ body is looking out for you .
That &apos;s when accidents happen , ok@@ ay ?
This isn &apos;t a personal problem . This is a professional one .
It makes you a bad hire .
Also , it means that I have to worry about you ,
And I don &apos;t want to worry about you .
I didn &apos;t mean to pr@@ y .
Oh , that &apos;s all right . Yes .
Yes , I &apos;m married .
What did you do ? !
I want you to shut the door
You &apos;re thro@@ wing your whole career away
This is not the end of my career .
The F@@ DA will never come anywhere near you again .
That is the end of your is@@ let cell trial ,
You ...
Open it ...
What ...
And read the first page .
A lot of questions came up today
She disappeared .
Well , that was a-@@ a mis@@ communication .
And the part about you two living in separate houses ,
Look , I get it .
It &apos;s not easy bringing a child into a relationship .
You &apos;re allowed to have some b@@ umps in the road .
But this afternoon , when it looked like
I set off some al@@ arms .
Now I &apos;m trying to dial them all back ,
Sorry , sorry , sorry .
I didn &apos;t mean to sc@@ are you .
We have a bo@@ un@@ ty on de@@ er .
They &apos;re eating up all the gardens .
Go through them in nothing flat .
But there &apos;s an up@@ side .
You like ven@@ ison ?
It might need a fresh@@ en-@@ up , but , u@@ h ...
I think you &apos;re gon@@ na have to agree ,
You guys got kids ?
U@@ h . Not yet .
We raised two kids in this house , my wife and I .
El@@ len .
She &apos;s gone now .
I lost her to cancer two years ago .
I &apos;m sorry to hear that .
So , what do you do , Scott ?
It &apos;s a bran@@ ding and advertising agency .
An@@ nie , do you work ?
I mostly write for women &apos;s magazines .
Articles about in@@ justice , women em@@ power@@ ment ,
This view is beautiful .
My great@@ -@@ great@@ -@@ grand@@ father built this house in 1905 .
It &apos;s the only house I ever lived in .
Why do you call it Fo@@ x@@ g@@ love ?
The entire valley used to be covered with the stuff .
Now it &apos;s kind of rare .
Fo@@ x@@ g@@ love is po@@ ison@@ ous , isn &apos;t it ?
High@@ ly .
Come on , I &apos;m gon@@ na give you the grand tour .
The house , it backs up to a woo@@ ded nature preserve .
L@@ ots of privacy , hu@@ h ?
After I sell the house , C@@ assi@@ dy , my daughter ,
Your wife was really beautiful .
Ye@@ ah .
We always had a lot of love in this house .
It &apos;s not that bad .
What is necessary is that I protect my wife .
If you w@@ anna protect your wife , get a gun .
No g@@ uns on my property .
You understand ?
What do you got against g@@ uns ?
I know what g@@ uns can do ,
When I was 12 , my brother was g@@ un@@ ned down in the street .
I know what g@@ uns can do , Charlie .
I &apos;m sorry for your loss .
Enjoy Florida .
H@@ ey , Rand@@ all . You be careful with these v@@ ines .
It took 50 years for these things to grow on the house .
Ok@@ ay , Mr. P@@ eck .
It &apos;s not your house .
Bab@@ e , what are you doing ?
I can &apos;t sleep .
I keep hearing this cre@@ aking sound .
Hon@@ ey , it &apos;s an old house .
Ok@@ ay , well , we don &apos;t know anything about this man ,
Now Charlie is after me ?
Since day one .
That &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous .
Oh , my God . You don &apos;t see it ?
What does it matter ? He &apos;s going to Florida any day now .
Is he ? Because his departure date just keeps moving .
So , what do you want me to do ?
Ok@@ ay , it &apos;s simple . I want you to tell him ..
Tell him that he &apos;s not welcome .
Ok@@ ay ? And if you can &apos;t tell him ,
You gon@@ na tell him ?
You don &apos;t think I &apos;ll tell him ?
I think we should go to dinner .
That was it . Ye@@ ah , that was it .
Oh , this place is definitely a ke@@ eper .
Good past@@ a , good wine .
Hon@@ ey , you gon@@ na be able to drive ?
Ye@@ ah . Not only can I drive , I ..
Why would he do that ?
Because you were right .
He &apos;s ob@@ s@@ essed with the house ,
Well , have you told An@@ nie what you &apos;re telling me right now ?
I tried . I tried , man , but she just won &apos;t buy it .
Look , I need you to do me a favor , all right ?
I need you to get Brian in IT to discre@@ et@@ ly
I really need to know who I &apos;m dealing with .
If there &apos;s anything to find on Charlie P@@ eck ,
Hello ?
Charlie , you sc@@ ared the sh@@ it out of me .
Oh , I &apos;m so sorry .
I am so sorry .
I thought you might be hung@@ ry .
How is he ?
He &apos;s ok@@ ay .
They &apos;re gon@@ na keep him overnight .
When I heard he was in the hospital ,
And I &apos;d come home , and the house would be dark and empty ,
and lon@@ ely , so ...
Any@@ way , I got you , u@@ h , an everything p@@ izza .
You just pick off what you don &apos;t like .
He &apos;s not the up@@ standing citizen
Not exactly your traditional holiday meal , is it ?
No , but I &apos;m star@@ ving , so this is perfect .
On your way back to the city ,
Make sure she &apos;s all right , call me back .
Well , that &apos;s like me .
I have a chance to get it all back .
All I have to do
What the ... ?
All right . Where am I gon@@ na put you ?
I haven &apos;t seen it around here
You ok@@ ay ?
Look , I know about you .
Your losses , your bank@@ rup@@ t@@ cy ,
So .... .

An@@ nie .
Bab@@ e , I would have came and got you . You ok@@ ay ?
What &apos;s wrong ?
I just ran into Charlie .
He was bringing you flowers .
No@@ body kno@@ cked on the door .
Did he come by here last night ?
He came by to see if I was ok@@ ay .
I think he &apos;s the one that tried to run me off the road .
You think Charlie tried to run you off the road ?
Yes .
Look , he &apos;s not who you think he is .
What time did Mike leave last night ?
How did he know ? How did he know I wasn &apos;t here ?
Think about that . How did he know ?
This ... This guy is dangerous . Ok@@ ay ?
Charlie is very dangerous .
Ok@@ ay . Ok@@ ay , babe , I believe you . I do .
He shows up again , you just ..
Just call the police , ok@@ ay ?
I &apos;m a professional danc@@ er .
My diet &apos;s pretty much leaves and tw@@ ig@@ s already .
There has to be something else .
Swe@@ e@@ tie , we made it through your cancer .
We &apos;ll make it through this .

It took a lot of courage to fly out on that stage ton@@ ight .
Do you have any idea how proud we are of you ?
You &apos;ve always just put yourself out there .
You are fear@@ less .
You &apos;re willing to show the world who you really are .
That &apos;s amazing

Let me talk you out of it .
Wo@@ w ! You guys are in good shape .
H@@ ey , N@@ ina , how are you ?
It &apos;s the video game guys !
Ye@@ ah .

We &apos;ve got about ten minutes till the sun rises .
And there are soldiers out there , ok@@ ay .
They &apos;ll take coun@@ t. we got to get back to the yard .

You know , we live a couple miles away

I am not doing what you think I &apos;m doing .
There &apos;s really no need to explain . I &apos;ll wait .
You just ... finish .
Re@@ ason ?
To get a look inside the bl@@ ad@@ der .
I appreciate you doing this , P@@ rest@@ on .
I know this is a little out of your field .
That &apos;s not a problem .
It gives my intern@@ s something to do .
I have a feeling you keep them plenty busy .
We were in the same fr@@ at at Tul@@ ane .
It &apos;s gone from tor@@ turing ple@@ dges
Be very careful how you two answer that .
I could tell some stories .
Bill , you have a camera sn@@ aking up your mo@@ jo .
It &apos;s not the time to cross me .
It isn &apos;t anything too serious ?
That &apos;s what this procedure will tell us .
He k@@ icks like you wouldn &apos;t believe .
A bad@@ ass , just like his father .
Mo@@ ve a little to the right .
Your other right .
There .
What do you see ? What is it ?
C@@ ould be any number of things .
O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , take a bi@@ op@@ sy of the mass .
Let &apos;s not worry until we have to .
There &apos;s too much damage .
We &apos;ll have to remove most of the col@@ on
You got@@ ta push it up .
More s@@ ut@@ ure . And what &apos;s with these dam@@ n lights in here ?
Mr. Franklin , how long has your ab@@ dom@@ en been like this ?
It &apos;s been getting bigger for a while .
I told him there was something wrong .
No one gets fat like this so fast . I told him .
Every@@ body told him .
I really like you , Oli@@ via .
I like you a lot .
Well , I like you , too .
I have s@@ yp@@ hi@@ lis .
That could have gone better .
Fine .
A few weeks ago , I was operating ,
After a few hours , it was fine .
It &apos;s come back again .
Did you have it checked out ?
The examination was normal .
My oph@@ thal@@ m@@ ologist tells me I &apos;m just getting older ...
but you know what a decline in my visual acu@@ ity can mean .
I &apos;ll set up some tests :
I know how the rum@@ or mill runs around here .
Let &apos;s just keep this to ourselves .
Absol@@ utely .
Ye@@ ah .
Do you think she &apos;s talking about me ?
She &apos;s absolutely talking about you .
Du@@ de , that &apos;s a good thing .
No . No , it &apos;s not .
Geor@@ gie , get a clu@@ e .
S@@ yp@@ hi@@ lis is the best thing that ever happened to you .
In their eyes , you &apos;re a player .
George , it &apos;s not a big deal .
And you have a cute but@@ t .
I have a cute but@@ t , too .
You want to see ?
Oh , get out . You &apos;re doing it wrong .
Be my guest .
We are saving George
Oh , cute but@@ t .
T@@ old you .
It is cute , like a baby &apos;s .
You know , I have spent hours , days , years ,
The reality is so much better .
I think he &apos;s gon@@ na cry .
Hi . It &apos;s Ms. Henry again .
Is this a better time ?
I just wanted to remind you
You know , you haven &apos;t been to any of our family functions .
You have to understand .
I &apos;m a sur@@ gical intern , so my time isn &apos;t my own .
Our residents really respond to these events .
They always enjoy themselves , which is so rare .
I think it &apos;s important you attend .
I &apos;ll be there .
I mean , we never said , &quot; We have rules , &quot;
When would I have time to go out and get s@@ yp@@ hi@@ lis ?
You &apos;re a hand@@ ful enough as it is ,
But no more g@@ low-@@ in-@@ the-@@ dark ones .
You see ? There &apos;s nothing to worry about .
Maybe we should , you know , make some rules , I mean .
We should .
Ok@@ ay .
Just for the record ...
I liked the g@@ low-@@ in-@@ the-@@ dark ones .
I bet you do .
That &apos;s the last of the o@@ vari@@ an material .
I just need to se@@ w up the per@@ for@@ ation on the bl@@ ad@@ der wall .
Is there a problem , Dr. Kno@@ x ?
Well , you said this man &apos;s wife is pregnant ?
Due in five weeks . Why ?
It is .. they &apos;re what hold back the ur@@ ine and the f@@ eces .
Look , may@@ be-@@ maybe you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t read it .
It &apos;ll only make you feel worse .
&quot; Co@@ oper and his team &quot; ?
You should know I had nothing to do with that .
At least they &apos;re talking about the theory .
I mean , that &apos;s what &apos;s important .
You know , you &apos;re right .
Ye@@ ah . You know , it &apos;s like when St@@ an Lee and Steve D@@ it@@ ko
St@@ an Lee may get all the credit ,
Even though St@@ an Lee gets to be in all the Mar@@ vel movies .
An@@ d-@@ and he &apos;s far ri@@ cher .
And he &apos;s a household name , you know ?
That &apos;s not helping .
Well , I &apos;d give more examples ,
Stu@@ art , we &apos;re here .
It &apos;s nice of you to let him keep staying at your mo@@ m &apos;s house .
Ye@@ ah , well , I tried putting him out on the cur@@ b ,
Just so you know , the power &apos;s out .
What happened ?
I called , they said a trans@@ former ble@@ w .
It &apos;s the whole block .
Should be fixed by tomorrow .
Wa@@ it , when did it go out ?
In the middle of the night .
Oh , my God .
How@@ ie , what &apos;s wrong ?
One Jewish las@@ agna ..
two pound cakes that are about eight pounds each ,
Ma always kept it on hand ,
She thought she could cure anything with her cooking .
Even the time I got food po@@ is@@ oning .
From her cooking .
Let &apos;s get started .
I &apos;m never gon@@ na talk to her again .
Should we tell everyone not to come ?
No . I want to do this .
Ok@@ ay . Well , I &apos;ll keep it together if you can .
Ok@@ ay .
I &apos;m not making any promises !
G@@ la@@ d you guys could make it .
Of course .
Wo@@ w , it looks really pretty in here .
It &apos;s not you . It &apos;s this place that &apos;s making you crazy .
You need to get out of here .
I mean , you need to get out of town , clear your head .
We &apos;re all going to the lake this weekend . Just come with me . I &apos;m leaving at lunch .
My parents would never let me do that .
You &apos;re not gon@@ na ask your parents ,
And I already took his car , so ...
You took your dad &apos;s car ?
I don &apos;t know . I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea , because ..
They &apos;re to make me less an@@ x@@ ious ,
And I pass out .
It &apos;s no big deal . I mean , everyone is on some sh@@ it .
Re@@ ally ?
Ye@@ ah .
We &apos;re all just kids doing little h@@ acks to try and live our best life .
Like , look , Brian P@@ ank@@ aus@@ kas .
Col@@ e , do you want a drink ? I &apos;ll get you one , OK ?
What was in it for the cul@@ t ? M@@ ust &apos;ve been good . Some@@ thing worth killing for .
M@@ mm , y@@ e@@ ah .
I &apos;d have to be promised everything I &apos;ve ever wanted .
My dream life .
But who could guarantee that ?
Stop ! You &apos;re making him un@@ comfortable .
There must be some contract
Ye@@ ah .
Come on , C
Stop !
Col@@ e didn &apos;t come on this trip to talk about some blood cul@@ t
Can we please change the subject and ...
Jesus . OK .
Are you sure you don &apos;t want one ?
I prefer not to lose my teeth .
Let &apos;s get you back on that gur@@ ney .

Any other choices ?
I like them .
Oh , g@@ ay couple .
U@@ h , that &apos;s not a man .
Oh , too bad . They &apos;re great with kids .
Ok@@ ay , that &apos;s it . No@@ body &apos;s ever gon@@ na be good enough for you .
So you &apos;ve totally ruled out keeping it ?
Yes , totally .
And I get no say in the matter ?
Now you &apos;re tal@@ kin &apos; .

By the way , big oil stain in the garage ?
He had the girls in there all afternoon .
It &apos;s gone !
Wo@@ w . Those two seemed so perfect for each other .
H@@ ey , I , u@@ h , I need to talk to you about Ben .
After what he did to me , I don &apos;t care .
He &apos;s in the hospital .
He is ?
What happened ?
I went to the site last night .
He started having chest pain@@ s .
They say it &apos;s not a heart attack ,
But Ben &apos;s a young guy . He &apos;s healthy .
Why is he having chest pain@@ s ?
Oh , he &apos;s been under a lot of stress .
Oh , is it the money thing ?
What was that for ?
For giving me the day off .
I was able to hit the entire left side of the m@@ all .
And if you &apos;re willing to keep tor@@ turing my kids ,
Hi , mo@@ m .
What &apos;s all this ?
The girls and I tac@@ kl@@ ed that dead tree out back .
I taught them some basic forest@@ ry procedure .
The older one is pretty good with an ax .
You might want to keep an eye on that .
Well , I can &apos;t thank you enough .
You are absolutely welcome to stay here ...

Well , the truth is , I &apos;m the hand@@ ful ,
I have to clear the air about a few things .
I don &apos;t think that &apos;s gon@@ na work .

He just kept h@@ acking at it
Re@@ ally ?
Ye@@ ah , you should go and look . Nothing left but a st@@ ump .

Ten signs you might be dying .

I think this came from a watch
A lot of sn@@ aps , a lot of t@@ we@@ ets .
You order that every night , Phi@@ l .
You should try something new .
Well , I don &apos;t want to try something new .
I want the por@@ k fried no@@ od@@ les from Mon@@ go@@ lian Palace .

Think about that .

Wa@@ it , really ? Why not back po@@ ckets ?

Arch@@ im@@ edes &apos; ex@@ cl@@ am@@ ation .
Eu@@ re@@ ka .
We may never know the answer to that clu@@ e ,
I have never be@@ aten her .
She &apos;s not the nic@@ est winner .
Not a clu@@ e .
You &apos;re probably right to ni@@ p that speech problem in the bu@@ d .
Mit@@ ch@@ ell had a li@@ s@@ p we let slide .
Now we got a lifetime of &quot; What if ? &quot;
A li@@ s@@ p doesn &apos;t make you g@@ ay .
Being g@@ ay makes you li@@ s@@ p .
Well , I finished the video for my Ju@@ illi@@ ard application .
I think they &apos;re going to be blow@@ n away .
Art school , hu@@ h ? Well , you can always sell or@@ ang@@ es by the side of the road .
Don &apos;t listen to him .
Go to your art school , be a play@@ w@@ right .
Oh , good God .
There are thousands of &quot; Hamilton &quot; par@@ o@@ dies ,
It &apos;s ok@@ ay , Pap@@ i . Maybe the people in New York
I &apos;ll never come up with something great by then .
Yes , y@@ O@@ U will , and I &apos;ll help .
You &apos;d do that for me ?
I got to get this k@@ id out of the house .

I keep leaving broch@@ ures around for schools at sea .
All right , car@@ b up , bud@@ dy .

Good one , Coach .
Life &apos;s more fun when you put stuff in football terms .
P@@ anc@@ akes , y@@ ay !
Oh , u@@ h , we &apos;re actually out of those .
You can have the rest .
No , no ! We put some performance supplements in there
What else is there ?
Well , I &apos;m going to the store later .
That isn &apos;t your real name , is it ?
O@@ w , I &apos;m not let@@ ting you behind that cur@@ tain .
That &apos;s my name , and these are my teeth .
My name &apos;s Phi@@ l Dun@@ phy .
I &apos;m doing a little real-@@ estate segment .
C@@ ould become a regular thing .
This is my mak@@ e-up artist / daughter , Hal@@ ey Dun@@ phy .
It is a pleasure . You know , I think
U@@ h , white , mid-@@ century , big back por@@ ch ?
That &apos;s her .
I need to wash my hands . Where &apos;s the rest@@ room ?
Oh , of course . You &apos;re gon@@ na want to
You &apos;re gon@@ na see some air v@@ ents on the way there .
It &apos;s just past that col@@ d-@@ air system .
Br@@ ing a swe@@ ater .
It ten@@ ds to get a little chil@@ ly in that neck of the woods .
What says to Ju@@ illi@@ ard , &quot; I &apos;m your guy &quot; ?
I look straight into the camera and say ,
but so is the she@@ er act of putting pen to paper .
You &apos;re kid@@ ding , right ?
Why ? What &apos;s wrong ?
It &apos;s s@@ mu@@ g and privileg@@ ed and precious .
No art school &apos;s gon@@ na want that .
Ok@@ ay . How about this ?
We open on a blan@@ k sheet of paper .
Under a Mozart fu@@ gue , we suddenly see a drop of blood .
I don &apos;t know . I caught her going through my g@@ arb@@ age ,
Well , that &apos;s wei@@ rd .
Any@@ way , tell her I &apos;ll have a couple more for her tomorrow .
Ok@@ ay . By@@ e-@@ b@@ ye . Take care .
She can &apos;t baby sit anymore .
I don &apos;t know .
We &apos;ve got a problem here .
Look what I found under D@@ w@@ ight &apos;s bed .
Ye@@ ah , it &apos;s too bad .
He brought such a great energy to the house .
Mit@@ ch@@ ell .
I just need a minute to process this .
But the bottom line , Kar@@ en , is , your vie@@ wers should work with
Some@@ one they can look in the eye .
Sky@@ diving .
U@@ gh . I see where he gets it from .
W@@ ake me when it &apos;s my turn .
I thought I could finally beat her because she &apos;s sick .
I just want her to lose so bad .
Ye@@ ah . So do I .
Che@@ ating ?
Are we really doing this ?
That s@@ mu@@ g sister of yours needs to be taken down a pe@@ g .
O@@ oh ! Pe@@ g .
Think bigger .
P@@ eg@@ s .
Ok@@ ay , Joe , repeat after me .
Red ro@@ ver , red ro@@ ver , red ro@@ ver .
Go ahead . It &apos;s perfectly safe .
H@@ ey . Did you just lock the door ?
The car does that automatically .
Here . Try on this hair net .
Is@@ n &apos;t this a little over the top ?
Was &quot; Stand and Deli@@ ver &quot; over the top ?
Yes , it was .
Fine , then act angry , like you &apos;re sick of
Ye@@ ah , that I can do .
Walk along that wall , read from your script .
Oh , I wonder who that could be .
Oh , Officer .
Is there a problem ?
I &apos;m here to arrest D@@ w@@ ight Bul@@ lock
We wanted to give L@@ ily a chance to come clean on her own .
Lu@@ ck@@ ily , we have a friend of a friend

Now we &apos;re gon@@ na take it down a not@@ ch .
H@@ old out your w@@ ri@@ sts .
No more school .

I gu@@ ess .
Mar@@ tha Ste@@ wart said she used the prison time
That is enough ! W-@@ W-@@ we know
You ow@@ e him an ap@@ ology this minute .
Yes , and there &apos;s gon@@ na be consequences .
No electronics for a week .
That &apos;ll be worse for you than for me .
No des@@ sert .
Ok@@ ay , that hun@@ ts .
That being said , we could &apos;ve handled things
We should &apos;ve talked to you
You mean I could have stopped it ?
Well , no , but at least we would &apos;ve know how you felt ,
Swe@@ e@@ tie , look , I , of all people , know what it feels like
Any@@ way , he would sn@@ ore ..

And four ,
Fl@@ ushing . Why we need to go there ?
I can help with that .
What would it take for you to put it all on the line ?
To stand down a tank
There &apos;s no way both of us walk away , not from that .
Two im@@ mov@@ able forces , neither side willing to back down .
In every crisis there &apos;s opportunity .
Paul made it a point to ask questions ,
He was our leader , and we would &apos;ve done anything for him .
It &apos;s a bl@@ ast from the past
Green Dra@@ g@@ ons , the most powerful gang in Que@@ ens !
Green Dra@@ g@@ ons !
This is a great man .
T@@ eddy S@@ ham had a hit single in Hong Kong
His son , R@@ ick@@ y , was Paul &apos;s best friend .
He was killed one night when he and Paul were out drinking
For F@@ au@@ l it was a matter of saving face .
For the rest of the Dra@@ g@@ ons ,
H@@ ey , Bob@@ o .
So you came here with your dad ?
E@@ ight years ago , y@@ e@@ ah .
You must get a k@@ ick listening to your father sing .
Look , Sonn@@ y , I should go .
H@@ ey , h@@ ey , h@@ ey !
Wh@@ atever you think I am , you &apos;re wrong .
What do you want , Sonn@@ y ? You want to be my boy@@ friend ?
Let me tell you something . I don &apos;t date Green Dra@@ g@@ ons .
It must be hard living a lie ,
Have a good night .
Da@@ i L@@ o ! Da@@ i L@@ o ! White Tig@@ ers !

Look , I just w@@ anna see you guys stay alive , ok@@ ay ?
Pa@@ thetic .
Let me gu@@ ess , you heard nothing , saw nothing
Help me out , little brother .
Go fu@@ ck yourself , big brother .
If you think of anything , call me .
H@@ ey .
You know , Big N@@ ose going to be all right
You probably don &apos;t know this , but
Can I ?
Our entire life is m@@ apped out in the eyes ,
It tells how your life will end
L@@ ies do not come easily for you .
If you live past this year , you &apos;ll live a long life .
Auth@@ orities say a Venezu@@ el@@ an tra@@ w@@ ler
I think we tell the families it was an act of God
W@@ inning at mah@@ j@@ ong doesn &apos;t mean winning every hand .
How many Chinese are there , Paul ,
Now this , Sam , this is different .
They ran the fu@@ cking boat right up onto the beach .
Don &apos;t you get it ? They &apos;re like rats .
You let one in , you get 10 . The next month , that 10 turns into 100 !
Ye@@ ah , no , I will .
You all right ?
I was nine when my mother died .
I can still remember her eyes . She was so sc@@ ared .
More than any Dragon ever !
I swe@@ ar to you on my honor ,
On the streets ,
There were always the back and for@@ ths ,
When the White Tig@@ ers shot up our place ,
We were more than happy to return the favor .
et &apos;s rock &apos; n &apos; roll !
It &apos;s a tra@@ p , mo@@ ther@@ fu@@ cker !
Let &apos;s go !
You ain &apos;t sh@@ it , I Ch@@ ung .

We Tig@@ ers wi@@ pe our asses with you pieces of sh@@ it .
C@@ ause he &apos;s Asian
I hear your boys have been playing a little rough l@@ ately
You look familiar
Look at this . Can &apos;t be good for business .
Do you know what bo ying means , Det@@ ective ?
What goes around comes around .
Br@@ ing@@ ing me in ,
How the hell you eat with those dam@@ n things is beyond me .
You know , they &apos;re coming , Sam .
Whether you want to believe it or not .
In case you forgot , let me remind you , we &apos;re the F@@ BI .
They put every convic@@ ted criminal they had on a boat to El@@ lis Island .
There &apos;s guys in Fl@@ ushing right now ,
And just like the Jews and the Irish or the Itali@@ ans before them ,
And there is , and it &apos;s about to become a crime problem .
You listen to yourself ?
If you w@@ anna investigate a couple of delivery boys , you go right ahead .
But don &apos;t do it on government time .
You are dead wrong about this .
That might change your life .
Ye@@ ah . U@@ gh . Sorry .
Don &apos;t say sorry .
You don &apos;t need to do that . You don &apos;t need to ap@@ ologi@@ ze .
It &apos;s a fu@@ ck@@ ed@@ -up female hab@@ it .
You don &apos;t need to be sorry for anything , ever .
That &apos;s true . That &apos;s great advice .
Thank you .
I love this music , by the way .
Thanks . Ye@@ ah .
If your head &apos;s gon@@ na end up in a tr@@ ash can ,
I just didn &apos;t think I would end up a single mo@@ m ,
I mean , my husband had life insurance ,
I put half of that away for Miles &apos; college ,
Thank God for his life insurance .
Ye@@ ah .
My husband doesn &apos;t have anything
Fu@@ cking have to pay for everything .
We can &apos;t even sell this house .
We bought it during the bub@@ ble .
Then you should move in .
Here . Che@@ ers to being house poor .
Yes , che@@ ers !
M@@ mm . What ?
That &apos;s , u@@ h ...
It &apos;s just another one of my bad decisions .
Ye@@ ah . It &apos;s great .
Is that a charity Symbol ?
Ye@@ ah , Mother Ter@@ esa and I are , like , the same person , so ...
It &apos;s a nice contrast with your ring .
Thanks . Ye@@ ah , this is a family hei@@ r@@ lo@@ om .
Your wife is trying to get me to stop ap@@ ologi@@ zing .
Or maybe you can get her to start .
Oh , mart@@ ini time ?
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s 5 : 00 somewhere .
Oh , my God , did you just come up
He &apos;s such a brilliant writer .
I have to say , you insp@@ ire me .
Not enough , apparently .
&quot; Why , thank you very much
Oh , I figured you &apos;d want a break
Christ , two days ?
What &apos;d she tell you ?
Um , she said she had to put out a big fire .
And I called her office ,
Ye@@ ah , that sounds about right .
I mean , I &apos;ve played through
Oh , fun ! Um ..
I &apos;m flying back tomorrow .
I &apos;ll pick up Nick@@ y as soon as I &apos;m on the ground .
Well , she said it was a work crisis ?
Ye@@ ah . She has a very high-@@ profile job
Most times when a woman van@@ ishes ,
What are you impl@@ ying , exactly ?
You two didn &apos;t have a fight ?
Some@@ thing to make you run off to London ?
Are you saying that I broke my mother &apos;s hip ?
You leave town , your wife takes off .
Maybe there &apos;s , um ,
Exc@@ use me , that &apos;s very ru@@ de .
He is a dedicated husband and father .
I have seen him with his wife , let me tell you ,
Just exploring all av@@ en@@ ues , ma &apos;@@ am .
Well , that av@@ en@@ ue is a dead end , so you can drop it .
And where &apos;s Em@@ ily &apos;s family ?
She doesn &apos;t have any .
She was an only child ,
I &apos;m sorry , I didn &apos;t know that .
We &apos;ll file a missing person &apos;s report
Thanks for holding . How may I direct your call ?
Her name is Em@@ ily Nelson .
She &apos;s the head of the PR department .
Em@@ ily &apos;s not in today .
I know she &apos;s not in .
Ye@@ ah , you got@@ ta go right at them .
Especially the powerful ones .
Or they will fu@@ ck you in the face .
Listen , you bar@@ gain bas@@ ement Tom Ford ,
And that they should stop buying your t@@ ack@@ y bl@@ ouses
Because if you lose m@@ oms , you lose business .
Ok@@ ay , number one ,
Number two , Tom Ford wishes he were me .
And number three , if I &apos;m t@@ ack@@ y ,
You &apos;re ..
This has been fun .
Better pray I don &apos;t have a bru@@ ise .
No wonder she doesn &apos;t like having her picture taken .
Look at our little Step@@ han@@ ie .
Did you two hat@@ ch this up ?
Is this a game , like when you sm@@ ash everything with trucks ?
Because you know what we say about lying .
I &apos;m not lying ! I saw her ! Fu@@ ck you !
H@@ ey , Nick@@ y !
I &apos;m sorry .
Don &apos;t I get a k@@ iss good night ?
Of course you do , swe@@ e@@ tie .
I &apos;m being serious .
It was because of you .
When Em@@ ily found out that you had been
It &apos;s probably the most responsible thing we ever did .
Thanks to you .
Mo@@ ve in with me .
We can start a whole new , wonderful life together .
Just you , me and the boys .
Please , say yes .
I love you , Step@@ han@@ ie Smo@@ thers .
I love you , too .
Hi , m@@ oms . This is Step@@ han@@ ie here .
I &apos;m gon@@ na do something a little different today .
I don &apos;t w@@ anna off@@ end any non-@@ den@@ om@@ in@@ ational m@@ oms .
But I do think that we live on after we die , S@@ O ..
Em@@ ily ,
And you &apos;ll always be Nick@@ y &apos;s mo@@ m .
I can &apos;t take your place .
I can just try to love the people that you love
I think that &apos;s what you would want .
Ok@@ ay , guys , it &apos;s getting too rough back there .
I mur@@ dered you !
Not me . I came back to life .
Like your mo@@ m !
Ok@@ ay , the d@@ oll@@ s are going in your back@@ p@@ acks
Oh , h@@ eck , y@@ e@@ ah . We got a ton of &apos; em down in the bas@@ ement .
You &apos;ll see nothing but sm@@ iles .
Hope and Fa@@ ith .
Hi . I &apos;m looking for the Mc@@ Lan@@ den Foundation .
Is this Margaret Mc@@ Lan@@ den ?
Who &apos;s this ?
Ye@@ ah . Hi , there . My name &apos;s Mar@@ y@@ anne Chel@@ k@@ ow@@ sky .
I &apos;m the director of the Squ@@ aw Lake Bible Camp .
What do you want ?
Well , we are putting together the 50@@ th anniversary
We &apos;re trying to track down some star al@@ umni .
D@@ ad believed her .
She &apos;s quite a woman , your mother .
I had a nice afternoon with Mag@@ s .
You met my mother ?
She likes her mart@@ in@@ is even stronger than yours .
We had a little walk down memory lane .
She &apos;s a cold woman , E@@ m .
B@@ et you couldn &apos;t do anything right in her eyes .
It was probably Fa@@ ith &apos;s idea to set the fire .
But then , all the bad ideas were Fa@@ ith &apos;s , weren &apos;t they ?
This is an ongoing investigation , Se@@ an .
For fu@@ ck &apos;s sake .
I can &apos;t let you into this house
She &apos;s gotten to you , has@@ n &apos;t she ?
This has nothing to do with Em@@ ily .
It &apos;s got everything to do with her .
No . U@@ h , I think that &apos;s when I s@@ nu@@ ck out to the car to listen to the game .
You go alone ?
Well would &apos;ve invited car@@ los , except ..
obviously , he can &apos;t really s@@ ne@@ ak around anymore , so ...
y@@ e@@ ah .
I was th@@ ink@@ in &apos; , if anyone asks about that fire at ri@@ ck &apos;s ,
Why would it matter ?
I didn &apos;t start the fire .
Right , right . It &apos;s just ...
if anyone thinks you did , it &apos;d be hand@@ y if y could prove them wrong , wouldn &apos;t it ?
There &apos;s no need to act like a silent movie hero@@ ine .
I know . I just .. I can &apos;t stop now .
I broke the seal .
Well , um , as much as I appreciate this naked display of emo@@ tion ,
I can &apos;t help it . My hormon@@ es are in over@@ drive .
No . Never .
really ?
Not even when you heard an acoustic guitar ?
No . Never .
Oh , I just can &apos;t control myself like that .
Oh , sure , you can .
Wh@@ enever I feel my emotions getting the best of me .
I simply picture an empty box , and I take whatever I &apos;m feeling and put that in the box ,
Then if I have time , I go back and open the box
in private , like a lady .
Thanks .
I &apos;m gon@@ na try that .
so you don &apos;t think I act like a lady ?
prove me wrong , swe@@ e@@ tie . Pro@@ ve me wrong .
All right . Come on , girl .
Ok@@ ay , car@@ los , here &apos;s the har@@ ness .
There you are !
I &apos;m doing my n@@ ails . He &apos;s wh@@ ining for the remote .
How do I get ro@@ xy to f@@ etch it for him ?
she &apos;s serious .
Ro@@ xy doesn &apos;t do that .
Um , her job is to get car@@ los from point &quot; a &quot; to point &quot; b &quot; as safely as possible .
I get that , but surely she &apos;s trained to do other stuff ,
Ye@@ ah , and after that , she can go solve crimes with sha@@ gg@@ y and the gang .
Don &apos;t ve me your blind sar@@ cas@@ m .
I saw a col@@ lie on tv who could push a la@@ wn m@@ ower .
Do you have one of those ?
Gab@@ y , ro@@ xy &apos;s fantastic .
Re@@ ally ? Well , for a dog who &apos;s supposed to help u@@ S , she sounds kind of limited .
sorry , but it &apos;s true .
Oh , it &apos;s fine . Sus@@ an , m@@ ashed is great , too .
it &apos;s not your favorite ?
what are you doing ?
Exc@@ use me . I have to put something in a box and stick it in the clos@@ et .
Hor@@ mon@@ es .
G@@ ot it .
Pre@@ t@@ ty much anything sets her off these days .
U@@ h , which is why I haven &apos;t told her .
told her what ? Some@@ thing wrong ?
Well , when b@@ ree and or@@ son were staying with US ,
M@@ ust have been quite a show .
No , this was the next night .
He was sle@@ ep@@ walking , and he said something kin@@ da strange .
But like I said , he was as@@ le@@ ep , so it &apos;s probably nothing .
Juli@@ e , what &apos;d he say ?
He said .. &quot; I &apos;m sorry I ran over mi@@ ke . &quot;
Why would he say something like that ?
He didn &apos;t even know you when that happened .
Ye@@ ah , you &apos;re right . It &apos;s crazy .
Ye@@ ah , that &apos;s what I figured .
Ok@@ ay , well , I &apos;m gon@@ na go check on mo@@ m and make sure she &apos;s ok@@ ay .
We don &apos;t need any more drama in this house .
y@@ e@@ ah , I agree .
How &apos;s the move going ?
Need an extra pair of hands ?
No , thanks . We &apos;re almost done .
Ok@@ ay , well , I won &apos;t get in your way then .
Let me just run something by you .
ash@@ v@@ a@@ ash@@ .@@ e I g@@ or a call today from a couple who loved our wo@@ k on the founder &apos;s ball .
ash@@ ys@@ ash@@ a g@@ or a call today from a couple who loved our work on the founder &apos;s ball .
Oh , how sweet .
Yes , and they want to hire US to do their anniversary party .
Hire US ? But we &apos;re not a business .
We could be . Think about it .
We do the exact same thing we did at the ball ,
That is a cher@@ ished recipe from my grand@@ mother .
Well , w it &apos;s a cher@@ ished recipe from catering by ka@@ therine .
Oh , I see what &apos;s going on here .
This is sh@@ am@@ eless emotional black@@ mail .
And ?
And .. it worked beautifully . I &apos;m in .
No more do@@ gg@@ y tre@@ ats . She &apos;s had enough .
But she &apos;s been so good .
Ye@@ ah ? Well , when she lear@@ ns how to make gran@@ ite sp@@ ark@@ le , she can have more .
I &apos;m giving her a treat .
Carlos , I said no .
fine . One treat .
That &apos;s it@@ .@@ Those things are expensive ,
So I gu@@ ess that means you won &apos;t be getting your hair done anymore .
Carlos , remember what my fingers look like ?
Just picture the middle one all by itself .
Besides , you &apos;re the one who married me for my looks .
I have looked from one end of town to the other ,
but since you love her so much , I &apos;m gon@@ na keep looking .
was that ro@@ xy ?
I &apos;m not sure .
Why don &apos;t I go look ?
She doesn &apos;t have to know that I saw you .
Oh , that &apos;@@ S ...
I don &apos;t know about that .
It &apos;s just that I have so many questions , and ...
I don &apos;t think we &apos;d be hur@@ ting any@@ body if we just sat and talked for a while .
And we &apos;d keep this from your mo@@ m ?
S@@ ure .
I w@@ anna have a sli@@ ce of p@@ ie with my daughter .
u@@ h , I think we might be out of cand@@ les .
I don &apos;t think so . Check under the bar .
R@@ ick .
&quot; How &apos;s it go@@ in &quot; ?
nothing happened between me and ri@@ ck .
Ok@@ ay .
I didn &apos;t set that fire .
You see ? I can talk slow , too .
Carlos asked me to pick Up some do@@ gg@@ y tre@@ ats for ro@@ xy .
Why didn &apos;t he ask me ?
Oh , I think you were busy at the time ... kid@@ n@@ apping his guide dog .
cl@@ assy , by the way .
Don &apos;t judge me .
You don &apos;t know this ho@@ und from hell .
But now that he &apos;s blind , it &apos;s just sick .
We &apos;re fine .
This is who we are .
This is our relationship .
Well , ur relationship has fo change gab@@ y , because he &apos;s changed .
Not that much . Just his eyes .
M@@ m , no .
I can &apos;t come out my front door every day and see that man .
We have to move .
sus@@ an ..
I know this is difficult ,
Take a step back from what ?
Well , &apos; ve talked to him .
Trust me , he &apos;s already been there .
Well , that &apos;s not enough .
He should pay for what he did .
He should go to prison .
H@@ ey you guys know you &apos;re not supposed to be out of bed .
How come d@@ ad@@ dy &apos;s sleeping on the couch again ?
Come here .
Come on .
ok@@ ay .
M@@ omm@@ y and d@@ ad@@ dy are son@@ t of ... fighting ,
What are you fighting about ?
Oh , something he did that made m@@ omm@@ y really mad .
Can we talk to you about something ?
Yes , of course .
The other day at the p@@ izza place ..
We heard d@@ ad@@ dy say that man wanted to take you away from US .
Oh , swe@@ e@@ tie , I am so sorry .
That &apos;s the vi@@ be that Bruce Lee taught me .
It &apos;s to always bring it .
That &apos;s what I get from Bruce .
And when did you leave Hong Kong ?
1959 , when I was 18 .
It had gotten a little difficult with the police on one side
He beat this k@@ id up , but he did@@ nt know
He got into so many street f@@ ights that by 18 ,
If he wanted his immigration status to be US citizen ,
To go when you &apos;re still a star is very strange ,
In Seattle , my father started teaching mar@@ tial arts .
He didn &apos;t ever look at people
If you had a sinc@@ ere interest in mar@@ tial arts ,
Tak@@ y K@@ im@@ ura was really his best friend .
Bruce used to come to my high school
He was five years older than we were ,
It wasn &apos;t long after that
We both attended the University of Washington .
We would get together on campus
And then when we were both done with our classes ,
And it was like ,
In the rest of the country there were no inter@@ racial mar@@ ri@@ ages .
I mean , it was very difficult .
My mother was not thri@@ lled when we decided to get married ,
The ban on inter@@ racial marriage was lifted in 1968 .
That didn &apos;t mean the ban lifted in people &apos;s hearts .
I don &apos;t care how good you are , 13@@ 5@@ 1@@ b w@@ rest@@ ler
The bigger guy equally
But the fact is , it wasn &apos;t about mass .
He would just put it down no matter how big you were .
But , then again ,
Whether Bruce Lee was a great fighter or wasn &apos;t a great fighter
You got the job on The Green Hor@@ net ,
I made that as a jo@@ ke , of course .
And it &apos;s a h@@ eck of a name , man .
Every time I said it at that time ,
Mr Rei@@ d &apos;s residence .
As a k@@ id , we wat@@ ched Green Hor@@ net for him .
We could care less about Te@@ en Hor@@ net .
He had a fly car , I &apos;ll give him pro@@ ps for the car ,
Every@@ body in the neighbourhood was fighting to be Bruce Lee ,
A lot of st@@ unt guys didn &apos;t know
You do the old John Wa@@ yne ,
With him , it &apos;s boo@@ m , boo@@ m , boo@@ m , boo@@ m ,
There &apos;s a shot of Bruce and he &apos;s doing a k@@ ick ,
There were all these seas@@ oned actors doing their thing ,
Th@@ ats something I can really
When I did The Green Hor@@ net , I was not being myself
The beauty was that he immediately said ,
By the way , I did a really terrible job in that , I have to say .
Re@@ ally ? You didn &apos;t like yourself ? I didn &apos;t see it .
He was always trying to be a holi@@ stic person ,
Mar@@ tial art has a very ,
And he was a very liter@@ ate guy .
He really did read
All type of knowledge ultimately means self-@@ knowledge .
He had a huge library of
Any book I &apos;d pick up , there were not@@ ations about
what was functional , what was no good !
As an actor , as a mar@@ tial artist , as a human being ,
Most of the writ@@ ings in the
And you can take most of the pass@@ ages from that book
He might have changed &quot; F@@ igh@@ ter &quot; From &quot; F@@ enc@@ er , &quot; but
It sounds Chinese but it &apos;s very much an American mar@@ tial art .
Was how can I most efficiently
The philosophy Bruce Lee had was :
The other stuff was Hollywood .
It can be taught .
Do you understand ?
But it cannot really be stand@@ ar@@ dis@@ ed .
And that &apos;s not to say that it can &apos;t be passed on .
But it was very personal to him .
J@@ K@@ D in 1970 will be different . &quot;
Our main event , for the light heav@@ y@@ weight title ,
You talk about Chinese bo@@ xing .
How does it differ from , say , our kind of bo@@ xing ?
Well , first we use the feet .
Second to none .
And then we use the el@@ bow .
Oh ! Beautiful el@@ bow !
Do you use the th@@ umb too ?
You name it , man , we use it .
Because that is the expression of the human body .
I mean the .. everything , I mean , not just the hand .
The crazy thing about mar@@ tial
There &apos;s no debate .
Bruce Lee is definitely the father of mixed mar@@ tial arts .
I do think ther &apos;s a cor@@ relation there ,
If D@@ ana White says Bruce Lee is the father of mixed mar@@ tial arts ,
In 1963 you &apos;ll see Gene
As I was cho@@ king him ,
And he was out , like ,
Gene Le@@ Bell taught Bruce Lee gra@@ p@@ pling moves .
I &apos;d throw him and fli@@ p him and
Then had a spin , do a c@@ res@@ cent k@@ ick on me
And he was a magnificent ath@@ l@@ ete .
If you &apos;re gon@@ na say father of mixed mar@@ tial ...
He &apos;s before anyone else .
He &apos;s the first one who decided to put it all together
They say that Bruce Lee was the father of mixed mar@@ tial arts .
That bo@@ thers me .
If he &apos;s the father of mixed mar@@ tial arts
And if you don &apos;t believe me , I &apos;ll cho@@ ke you
When you get into this whole mar@@ tial arts thing
People get p@@ is@@ sed off and bom@@ bed out and everything else .
But Bruce Lee is 100 percent the father of mixed mar@@ tial arts .
He was so directed and
It &apos;s really heavy and it says ,
&quot; The right p@@ unch comes .
I think the successful ingredient in it
Y@@ our@@ self ?
My@@ self , right .
And did that part , just expressed myself like I say
He was very proud of Long@@ street , and it was very much from him
He &apos;s one of my students .
Was he too ?
Yes .
You &apos;ve had everybody as your student .
But there were some lines there expressed your philosophy .
I don &apos;t know if you remember them .
I remember .
I said . This IS what it is OK
I said empty your mind .
Like water .
Now , you put water into a cup
Put water into a bottle , it becomes the bottle .
You put it in a te@@ ap@@ ot , it becomes the te@@ ap@@ ot .
Now , water can flow or cre@@ ep or dri@@ p or crash .
Be water , my friend .
Like that . You see ?
That was .. It was made
Bruce Lee plays a work@@ ing-@@ class hero .
He &apos;s from the land . He &apos;s one of the folk .
But at the same time as that , he &apos;s never one of the guys .
And this is why it was so
Bruce Lee completely changed
It &apos;s about making violence look beautiful
It &apos;s a bal@@ let . In terms of
But the Western movies really p@@ iss me off .
They cho@@ p &apos; em up so much .
In three months he was sw@@ ing@@ ing
I was living in Miami when they came out .
Every gang@@ ster in town had nun@@ ch@@ ak@@ us ,
I would spend hours whi@@ pping
In a short time I think almost every child is using this .
It became like a household product .
It &apos;s out@@ law@@ ed now in California .
After I wat@@ ched this movie , I used to use that .
But I always hit my el@@ bow .
Right out of the gate I sw@@ ung
And I hit my head
And after that I stopped making the noise
I tried to make my parents
I had the rubber ones . So I &apos;m good .
I got into it because I stopped carrying a gun .
I carried a gun for years .
I &apos;m not ash@@ amed to admit it .
I think I went into therapy and I thought ,
This one particularly is sen@@ tim@@ ental for me .
They &apos;re ready to film , have all this crew ,
He wants to put a little more
Bruce knew what he wanted Dragon to be ,
And he was ad@@ am@@ ant he was not going to the set .
It was kind of hard around
He could lose his temp@@ er .
If he didn &apos;t like anything you did , he would tell you .
Lin@@ da was that f@@ abul@@ ous wife .
She knew how to talk to him and coun@@ sel him .
I was talking behind the
It was a coming together , and ,
Let me think .
Don &apos;t think . Re@@ el .
And they &apos;re all better off , the world is better off ,
Action .
Enter the Dragon was Hollywood &apos;s first di@@ pping its toe
Bruce Lee is explo@@ sive in a way that no one had seen before .
The opening scene , Bruce Lee
You see a lot of complex emotions all going on at once .
I haven &apos;t seen any actor in an action film
The mirror scene was just , you know , when he &apos;s walking around
Dest@@ ro@@ y the image and you will break the enemy .
you defeat the enemy
This is the moment that he was waiting for .
This was Bruce Lee &apos;s film in Hollywood .
Bruce was in a studio doing du@@ b@@ bing for Enter the Dragon
I was called and came to the hospital .
And he was un@@ conscious and I was talking to him ,
It was a cer@@ eb@@ ral o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ,
T@@ ed W@@ ong used to always tell me ,
The doctors were very re@@ ass@@ uring .
He had just had a collapse .
He didn &apos;t have frequent head@@ aches .
I had seen him in June .
He told me that he &apos;d had an OK from U@@ CL@@ A that his body was fit .
He was not wor@@ ried about
Bruce Lee faces a real di@@ lem@@ ma .
He &apos;s on the ver@@ ge of star@@ dom in the United States
So what does he chose , the East or the West ?
It &apos;s the kind of problem
I was called and told by Ray@@ mond Ch@@ ow ,
So eventually the am@@ bul@@ ance arrived . It took a long time .
Everything took too long a time .
He got to the hospital and I saw him la@@ ying there
And I remember turning to
It j@@ ammed before it made it to market .
The business made us destroy it .
You guys said something about body parts ?
Ye@@ ah . We found some in a truck
It was mixed in with a lot of sh@@ red@@ ded stuff ,
Truck &apos;s mani@@ fest led us here .
G@@ ot to be some mistake .
Company sends us all kinds of material to sh@@ red .
Electronics , appliances , appar@@ el ,
H@@ ey , som@@ ebo@@ dy has to lose the Super Bow@@ l , right ?
No . We don &apos;t sh@@ red people .
Maybe someone fell in .
Well , we &apos;ve got cameras everywhere .
Not to mention O@@ SH@@ A .
Some@@ one so much as gets a paper cut ,
You &apos;re gon@@ na have to shut it down right now , b@@ oss .
We need to take a look at it .
We want to talk to everybody who worked that night shift .
Plus we &apos;re going to need to see what your &quot; E@@ yes &quot; Sa@@ w :
H@@ ey , got one right here .
You can , u@@ h , sh@@ red it when we &apos;re done .
Exc@@ ept for the big stuff ,
They fill them up at their offices ,
That &apos;s it ; that &apos;s the whole grav@@ ey@@ ard shift .
Like I said , no one fell in .
Well , maybe they didn &apos;t have to .
if I was going to get rid of a body ,
All this came from the one truck with the body parts ?
Ye@@ ah . L@@ ooks like we &apos;re in for a long day .
Did you really sign up for this ?
Ye@@ ah , as my recent brush with T-@@ Re@@ x confirms ,
Still got W@@ endy on your mind , hu@@ h ?
Ye@@ ah .
Belie@@ ve me , I get it .
I know what you need , H .
Good night out on the town .
Ye@@ ah .
When ?
All right , guys , we got paper , plastic , metal ,
I got &quot; Yu@@ ck . &quot;
Always a del@@ ight .
Som@@ ebo@@ dy &apos;s in a good mood .
Well , I enjoy a good puzzle now and again ,
You have a ... certain g@@ low .
Ho@@ dges opened his big mouth .
Det@@ ective V@@ art@@ ann &apos;s a good man .
Can we , u@@ h ... get to the go@@ o ?
I , u@@ h , sent representative samples to DNA .
We &apos;ll see what we get .
Ob@@ viously , the body &apos;s too man@@ g@@ led
Weight of the parts suggests that
I took a tissue sample .
Put your nose down the scope .
I &apos;ll give you a tour .
Well , a portion of the cran@@ ial bone
Are you thinking entry wo@@ und ?
More than thinking . I also found this .
Bul@@ let fra@@ g .
It stuck around .
Gre@@ g found bul@@ let frag@@ ments
We &apos;ll run everything through bal@@ li@@ sti@@ cs ,
No way !
You know this guy ?
Well , y@@ e@@ ah , if it &apos;s the Lar@@ ry L@@ al@@ otte .
Hav@@ en &apos;t you &apos;ve seen his online ads ?
&quot; How much would you pay for peace of mind ?
For a monthly fee ,
I just signed up last month .
Since when do you worry about identity the@@ ft ?
Every aspect of our life has been reduced
All we are is zer@@ oes and ones .
I &apos;m Lar@@ ry L@@ al@@ otte .
My name is Lar@@ ry La@@ Mot@@ te , and I want to ask you a question .
How much would you pay for ... ?
You &apos;re Lar@@ ry La@@ Mot@@ te ?
Yes .
Now , did I hear you gentlemen correctly ?
I &apos;m dead ?
You look younger on TV .
Bet@@ ter-@@ looking , too , right ?
Marketing 101 .
You got something to sell ,
And who is the man in front of the camera ?
Wes@@ ley . Works in the mail@@ room .
Ye@@ ah , he can &apos;t string two sent@@ ences together ,
So , gentlemen , what about this dead thing ?
Well , as I was , u@@ h , telling Mr. Kap@@ lan ,
Some@@ one had forc@@ e-@@ fed him credit cards .
The credit cards were in your name .
My name ? !
And the next thing I know , I got loans taken out in my name ,
Hell , they even re@@ poss@@ essed my truck
You got an ali@@ bi ?
Six of &apos; em .
Thanks to Lar@@ ry La@@ Mot@@ te , there &apos;s a half do@@ zen guys
You running the credit card
Ye@@ ah .
On the computer in the bul@@ l@@ pen .
Those are my numbers on my computer .
I &apos;m checking my purch@@ ases .
There are plenty of leg@@ it companies doing this , but .
I can &apos;t believe that I trusted those guys .
Ye@@ ah .
It &apos;s like that friend that you meet in science camp ,
And you need one , so you figure , why not ?
And then he starts showing you this sk@@ et@@ ch@@ book ,
Ho@@ dges ..
It &apos;s not the same .
Oh , of course not , no .
So , the older frag@@ ment is from a different gun .
Right , but could still come from the same victim .
How ?
A previous incident .
It shows signs of en@@ cap@@ s@@ ulation .
Over time , the body &apos;s defense mechanism
So far , we have nothing to identify our sh@@ red@@ der guy .
Maybe this sh@@ red of evidence will help .
No@@ body &apos;s perfect . Kind of looks like a Chi@@ a P@@ et .
Car@@ tri@@ dge case from the shooting .
W@@ eren &apos;t able to pull a print , though ?
No , the only good thing about a case going cold is
M@@ ight get something now .
Ok@@ ay , so we &apos;ve got two sho@@ ot@@ ings , six years apart .
Julius Kap@@ lan and a John Do@@ e in an al@@ ley
There &apos;s got to be a connection somehow .
And then k@@ ills him with a G@@ lock .
Then someone k@@ ills Julius Kap@@ lan ,
Two crimes , same sho@@ oter ?
C@@ ould be .
It doesn &apos;t make sense , Catherine .
Sh@@ red@@ der Gu@@ y had a credit card
So , why would an identity th@@ ief come all the way to Vegas
Right .
Maybe he just wanted a free trip to Vegas on Lar@@ ry &apos;s di@@ me .
Maybe he wanted Lar@@ ry La@@ Mot@@ te to know he was in town .
Ei@@ ther way , something else is going on .
I mean , Julius Kap@@ lan said it himself .
&quot; Why kill a p@@ enn@@ y-@@ ante th@@ ief ? &quot;
Well , he might be , if the th@@ ief is threat@@ ening
Fac@@ ial recognition got a hit on Sh@@ red@@ der Gu@@ y .
DM@@ V in Florida
Check out the name .
The real Lar@@ ry La@@ Mot@@ te .
Well , if he &apos;s Lar@@ ry La@@ Mot@@ te ,
See this car@@ tri@@ dge case ?
We pulled a si@@ x-@@ year-old print off it .
It has all the personal information we need to identify you .
You have a very impressive C@@ V .
Bur@@ gl@@ ary , fraud , and identity the@@ ft .
Good@@ b@@ ye , Lar@@ ry La@@ Mot@@ te .
Hello , Ar@@ lo Kar@@ den .
Ar@@ lo Kar@@ den doesn &apos;t have the same ring to it , I &apos;ll give you that .
Step away from the car .
Information is currency .
That &apos;s what they say .
And you turned it into cold , hard cash .
The all-@@ knowing executive assistant .
Kno@@ ws every phone call ,
You knew the real Lar@@ ry .
You knew about the black@@ mail .
You knew about your b@@ oss with@@ drawing five million bu@@ cks .

The thing about the &quot; qu@@ o &quot; is ,
Just like my b@@ oss .
And the &quot; qu@@ id pro qu@@ o &quot; started a long time ago .
Exc@@ ept then , it was about holding on to my job .

M@@ m . My mother wouldn &apos;t appro@@ ve ;
She calls it &quot; The bos@@ om &apos;s welcome m@@ at . &quot;
It &apos;s just so hard to tell what will look good on me .
No . This is just to give you ideas .
You know , do-@@ do you want something simple and elegant ?
I mean , do you want a train ?
O@@ oh , we &apos;re talking about trains .
Not the kind of trains you like .
I def@@ y you to name a train that I don &apos;t like .
The kind on the back of a wedding dress ?
I did not see that coming . Good job .
But while we &apos;re on the subject of fashion ,
What should I wear ?
M@@ m . Well , I &apos;ve got a push@@ -up bra I can loan you
How much money are you asking for ?
$ 500 million .
Then I &apos;d go no bra .
What do you need that kind of money for ?
I have figured out an experimental design
I just need 2,@@ 14@@ 8 high-@@ power las@@ ers
Just no@@ d .
Shel@@ don , they &apos;re not gon@@ na give you half a billion dollars .
I mean , they won &apos;t even give me that much
No . Sh@@ h .
But I need it . It &apos;s the only way to sett@@ le the contradic@@ tions
Well , it &apos;s too much money , you can &apos;t ask for that all at once .
Well , what if I ask for it in six easy install@@ ments
Ok@@ ay . What if you asked for $ 20 million ?
So , u@@ h , what do you say ?
We have a deal ?
He said no ?
No . That &apos;s only a two letter word .
You &apos;re gon@@ na have to double down .
Well , I &apos;m sorry , Shel@@ don , but this sort of thing happens .
Hig@@ gs had to wait almost 50 years
50 years ?
But I want to play with it now .
You just have to wait for science to catch up
Take that , M@@ om .
You know what they say :
Is it possible that the very first dress is the dress ?
Oh , don &apos;t be sil@@ ly .
You can &apos;t buy the first dress you try on .
Ok@@ ay , well , you know ,
Just be gentle .
It &apos;s never felt the touch of a man before .
You don &apos;t seem like you really want to sell these .
Of course I don &apos;t want to sell these .
These are all important to me ,
Ok@@ ay . U@@ h , why don &apos;t you leave these here with me ,
Is it ok@@ ay if I stand here and watch ?
S@@ ure .
If anyone asks , tell them I was bra@@ ve .
H@@ ey , I can &apos;t believe you just thre@@ w me under the bus .
I know , right ? That was crazy .
Well ...
Do you know how that makes me look ?
If &apos;s ... It &apos;s w@@ ow .
Right ? !
I loved the mac@@ ar@@ oni neckl@@ ace he made me in first grade .
and I even used the perf@@ ume he gave me in fifth grade ,
People are gon@@ na think I played for the Kn@@ icks in the &apos; 7@@ 0s .
It &apos;s the most beautiful gest@@ ure I have ever seen .
It &apos;s 100 % Class .

Exc@@ use me .
This is a fun game , isn &apos;t it ? But you know what ?
Maybe one where we just sat at a table .
Con@@ grat@@ ulations on the first
Un@@ less you want to ski@@ p all that
Thanks for helping me with the cap@@ -@@ and-@@ g@@ own m@@ ess .
Got@@ cha .
I learned how to shoot a gun when I was eight .
I learned how to fight .
l had night@@ mar@@ es about the bas@@ ement .
Social Services came when I was 12 years old and took me away .
I &apos;ve spent my entire life trying to get over the par@@ ano@@ ia
Ye@@ ah , he kind of remin@@ ds me
Ye@@ ah , that quar@@ ter@@ back thing is all mess@@ ed up .
Good times , right ?
What is she gon@@ na do with herself ?
I know . It &apos;s not your job to save her .
She &apos;ll be all right .
I can &apos;t get reception on this thing
Why do we have to come out again ?
We do this all the time .
What ? You don &apos;@@ t. you don &apos;t enjoy it ?
We &apos;re gon@@ na have a fu@@ cking cir@@ cus on our hands .
But h@@ ey .
What are we gon@@ na do ?
Cancel Halloween ?
Dr. Ray , please pick up line two .
l need to go do a number two almost immediately .
I &apos;m really tired of everybody let@@ ting me down all the time .
You des@@ erve better .
I mean ..
All@@ y@@ son , you &apos;re the cool@@ est , you &apos;re the pret@@ ti@@ est ,
And if anyone doesn &apos;t appreciate that ,
Thank you .
That &apos;s very sweet .
Let &apos;s get out of here .
l know a short@@ cut .
From a clinical perspective ,
There are many ways for trage@@ dy and violence
They can grow acc@@ ustom@@ ed to always being afraid ,
They can grow weak , they can grow strong .
But there &apos;s also the other side .
What other side is that ?
You understand ? We do this one thing .
We do one more hit , we have the cash to get started .
One fu@@ cking thing , Jim@@ my .
Jesus , let &apos;s fu@@ cking go .
Are we good ?
Let &apos;s just get it over with .
Fu@@ cking hands in the air , mo@@ ther@@ fu@@ cker !
Open the fu@@ cking safe !
Mo@@ ve it ! Open the go@@ d@@ dam@@ n safe !
This is Agent Mart@@ ine@@ z requ@@ esting immediate backup
T@@ aking risks for what ? For money .
But your kids ?
That &apos;s right .
That &apos;s the right move , you putting your kids first .
I would &apos;ve done the same thing .
I didn &apos;t put them first . I did this for me .
Living all these years , just th@@ an@@ king people .
Th@@ an@@ king you . Th@@ an@@ king some man holding the door .
Th@@ an@@ king a priest for his bl@@ ess@@ ings .
Th@@ an@@ king Jim@@ my .
Th@@ an@@ king God .
And with all that , I never walked a day on the streets
Gary won &apos;t sign my petition unless I sign his .
It &apos;ll be a cold day in hell before that
Where were we ?
I was just about to make my decision
I got the power suit , the corner office .
A clos@@ et doesn &apos;t get installed in this town
But one important decision ,
I sing . I saw you singing
It &apos;s all about the songs .
Write what you care about , what you &apos;re afraid of .
Wh@@ atever it is , it needs to be truth .
Is that what you write about ? The truth ?
Bro@@ ther , I write love songs , to God .
Mo@@ stly to God .
Sometimes to a girl .
I &apos;m writing one right now for a girl , and this girl , man , she is ..
So , y@@ e@@ ah .
Write what you love , y@@ e@@ ah ? Get after it .
I &apos;ve been listening to this G@@ inny O@@ wen@@ s song
Ye@@ ah
has chosen something bigger for me ,
But to be honest with you ...
I am so sc@@ ared .
But I have to believe there &apos;s a reason .
If one person &apos;s life is changed by what I go through ...
it Will all be worth it .
Look , man . I should &apos;ve told you .
Which means I have a lot of time to think
You &apos;re so good at it .
Ancient stories , still relevant and true .
In one story . God grants healing
Yet to another , His call is to suffer , and even die
Because each is a chapter in a bigger story .
Each is the stroke of a brush on His beautiful canvas .
Each is the light of one star helping to form a galax@@ y .
And I think I &apos;m one of those lucky people
I had my mi@@ racle .
It led to the perfect day with you .
It was enough
And God is worth tru@@ sting .
Even when we can &apos;t see .
All right , you may talk in the bedroom ,
All right , just this once you may close the door .
But keep in mind I &apos;ll be right out here
Oh , dam@@ n it .
Leon@@ ard , when you get this message , call me .
Pri@@ ya , this is your brother .
When you get this , tell Leon@@ ard to check his vo@@ ic@@ email .
Would you be sleeping over again this evening ?
Because you &apos;re welcome to .
who I can and can &apos;t have a relationship with .
Actually , he can .
The Hind@@ u Code of Man@@ u is very clear in these matters .
If a woman &apos;s father is not around ,
The code also states
There it is , Pri@@ ya . We &apos;re Indian .
We believe this stuff .
Some of it makes sense , some of it &apos;s crazy .
My point is , you can &apos;t go out with Leon@@ ard .
Who can &apos;t go out with Leon@@ ard ?
My sister .
Penn@@ y , this is Ra@@ i &apos;s sister , Pri@@ ya .
It &apos;s very nice to meet you .
Oh . Then perhaps you don &apos;t understand what &apos;s going on .
Your former boy@@ friend has replaced you
Ar@@ gu@@ ably much more suitable than you .
Oh . Well , good for him .
H@@ ey , what do you mean , &quot; More suitable &quot; ?
I &apos;m doing research on emotions and brain activity .
So when you start cr@@ ying ,
Then I &apos;m going to stim@@ ulate the an@@ alog@@ ous area
Cool , hu@@ h ?
I choose you .
Re@@ ally ?
Y@@ ep . I moved out of my mother &apos;s house .
C@@ ord is cut@@ .I &apos;m all yours .
What did she say when you told her ?
I don &apos;t know . She has@@ n &apos;t responded to my email yet .
This is so great .
You got all the talent in the world and all you w@@ anna do is m@@ ess around .
I &apos;m told you &apos;re a man of influence , Mr. Mag@@ u@@ ire
to help bring our product into the city .
We use our contacts in the union , Pop .
Three b@@ ins a month .
and all they got@@ ta do is make sure they pass through without inspection .
What exactly is your product ?
Her@@ o@@ in .
Nin@@ et@@ y-@@ nine percent pure .
The very best in the world .
And my son told you I &apos;d be interested in this ?
Very interested .
The business has changed , Mr. Gre@@ z@@ da .
Tw@@ enty years ago , I made a living , the same way we all did .
Cou@@ ple big scores a year ...
.. but mostly I was a grin@@ der .
You know what that but@@ cher shop ts to@@ day@@ &apos;
An App@@ le@@ be@@ e &apos;s .
Why are you telling me this ?
Because I &apos;ve had to adapt to the times .
I am a legitimate business@@ man now .
I know your business Mr. Mag@@ u@@ ire .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m here .
You &apos;re wa@@ sting your time .
Who@@ a , wh@@ oa , wh@@ oa . H@@ ey , h@@ ey . Wa@@ it ! Come on , now .
Pop just listen to what he has to say .
Take the night to think it over . Once you &apos;ve considered it more carefully ..
you &apos;ll realize the mistake you are making
Everyone I came up with is either dead
I don &apos;t make mistakes .
It &apos;s Christ@@ mas@@ time
Get the fu@@ ck out of my house .
Take this sh@@ it with you .
My old man . I don &apos;t even know what just happened .
We paid you to guarantee your father &apos;s support .
Let me talk to him , all right ? I &apos;ll get it all figured out .
I &apos;ll be st@@ opping by your house ton@@ ight to pick up our money .
You know what happens if you don &apos;t have it .
Fu@@ cking g@@ arb@@ age . I hate Alban@@ ians .
What the fu@@ ck was that ?
Did you even listen to what he had to say ?
That &apos;s not our business , D@@ anny .
Sh@@ ut your mouth . I &apos;m talking to my father .
What &apos;s the problem , D@@ anny ?
The problem is , all I ever hear out of your mouth ..
is when am I gon@@ na pull my weight .
And now I bring you a piece of business , a good piece of business
Ye@@ ah .
When I was younger ..
som@@ ebo@@ dy made me the same proposal .
I made so much money bringing co@@ ca@@ ine into the city
The problem was , everybody got h@@ ook@@ ed on the sh@@ it .
until I couldn &apos;t recognize them anymore .
I had to kill people I loved because I couldn &apos;t trust them .
Not enough money in the world to pull me back in .
Pop , made promises to these people .
I can &apos;t just walk away .
o@@ int Ple@@ as@@ ant .
&quot; 70 . We en@@ listed that fall
You were in this one with ..
you know , what was that red@@ head &apos;s name ?
Mau@@ re@@ en Gal@@ vin
b@@ am , she sm@@ acked her head right on that thing , kno@@ cked herself out .
You get enough to eat ?
This is detention , not art class .
Con@@ centr@@ ate .
O@@ i ! Alex El@@ li@@ ot !
Wa@@ it for us . We w@@ anna talk to you .
Where are you going ? Don &apos;t run away .
What &apos;s the matter ? What are you fri@@ gh@@ tened of ?
Go , go ! Run , get him !
That fast as you can go ?
We &apos;re right behind you !
Alex El@@ li@@ ot !
O@@ i ! Come here ! Here , boy !
H@@ ey , L@@ ance ! I &apos;ve got him .
O@@ i . What you running for ?
You and me have got a fight to finish .
We &apos;d better leave .
Hello ? Is any@@ body here ?
Come across the garden walls .
You &apos;ve got@@ ta see what I found .
The sword has returned .
Has returned . Retur@@ ned .
The sword has been drawn .
Let the roots be my senses .
Sens@@ es .
Let the land be my eyes and ears .
E@@ yes and ears .
Find the one who drew it .
Find the new king .
The sword must be mine . The king must die .
The king . The new king . Find the new king .
Find the new king .
Maybe it &apos;s a p@@ rank .
A YouTube thing . A social experiment .
Maybe there were hidden cameras .
Look .
There &apos;s something written on the guard .
Put it into Google Translate .
What just happened ?
Pay attention , everybody .
We have a new pup@@ il joining the class today .
Why don &apos;t you introduce yourself ?
Gre@@ etings , young academ@@ icians . My name is ...
Go away .
We don &apos;t know you , and we don &apos;t want to know you .
Leave us alone !
Good people ,
And this boy among you drew Exc@@ ali@@ b@@ ur .
Who will kne@@ el at his feet and swe@@ ar alle@@ gi@@ ance ?
Stop it ! Stop that !
But R@@ ok@@ as saw it with his own eyes .
Dan@@ ielle said they tried to catch it for two hours ,
Mor@@ tes Mill@@ es ? Is that what came to get me last night ?
F@@ allen war@@ ri@@ ors from batt@@ les of old .
Their souls ens@@ la@@ ved by evil .
For now , they can only enter this realm after dark .
But ...
when they rise , time free@@ zes
Their sp@@ ell is only broken at sun@@ rise .
Or when every risen war@@ ri@@ or ...
is destroyed .
That &apos;s why my m@@ um disappeared .
That &apos;s why everything went back to normal after you left .
There are three mo@@ ons until the solar ec@@ lip@@ se
Exc@@ ali@@ b@@ ur .
Who &apos;s M@@ organ@@ a ?
She was King Arthur &apos;s half-@@ sister .
She is gre@@ ed , enti@@ t@@ lement ,
Men &apos;s hearts have grown hol@@ low .
That &apos;s why her strength returns .
And that is why the sword has returned .
And I &apos;m supposed to stop her ?
That &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous . I &apos;m 12 .
I &apos;m not even old enough to do a paper round .
You &apos;ll have to find someone else .
It &apos;s too dangerous , we &apos;ll die .
So , there &apos;s your sword back .
It &apos;s been great to meet you , and good luck with everything .
Your qu@@ est has been decided .
There is no turning back .
You must find the entrance to the Under@@ world .
De@@ fe@@ at M@@ organ@@ a in her own realm
You have been chosen
Christmas Day , that was exhau@@ sting .
If I have to transform into my adult self
The path you choose must be your own .
Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God .
This is the worst and best
We need to go somewhere no one can find us .
Some@@ where we can think .
See ? N@@ one of this happened by accident .
This is dest@@ iny .
This was meant to be .
So they think themselves k@@ nights ?
How del@@ u@@ ded they are .
Sir L@@ ance , Lady Ka@@ ye .
A pleasure to make your acquain@@ t@@ ance .
Do us a favor , Mer@@ tin .
Don &apos;t talk to us . We &apos;re only here for the f@@ ights .
That &apos;s hardly the attitude of a k@@ night , young man .
Where &apos;s your respect for the Chi@@ val@@ ric Code ?
Don &apos;t tell me you &apos;ve never heard of the Chi@@ val@@ ric Code .
Driver ! Stop this coach at once !
The Code is the cor@@ ner@@ stone of a civili@@ zed society ,
If you don &apos;t know the Code , then this entire enterprise
What the hell is he on about ?
Exc@@ use me , but why are we getting off the coach ?
Short@@ cut .
Follow me . Quick@@ ly . No sl@@ acking .
H@@ alt !
Now , pay close attention .
The Chi@@ val@@ ric Code is the set of rules
Bre@@ ak any of these rules from the moment the sword was drawn ,
I trust that is not a problem .
O@@ i ! Mini Mer@@ lin ! What are you doing ?
We &apos;re not walking to Corn@@ wall !
Indeed , we are not .
And for centuries ,
Was it a temple ? A bur@@ ial ground ?
Some sort of astro@@ logical clock ?
St@@ on@@ eh@@ enge is a transport hub .
And just because the Romans kno@@ cked half of it down ,
U@@ h , exc@@ use me !
The general public &apos;s not permitted
H@@ ey , wait ! Security ! Security !
Come on !
You see ? They &apos;re all linked .
All the Pal@@ e@@ oli@@ thic standing stones in the country .
Bu@@ ilt as a magical conv@@ ey@@ ance system ,
We are now on Bo@@ d@@ min Mo@@ or ,
A simple duplic@@ ation sp@@ ell
What are you doing , boy ?
I do magic tri@@ cks for a hob@@ by ,
So , I &apos;m gon@@ na video what you do and try and copy it .
I &apos;ll be most impressed if you succeed .
Now , you have an army to fight ,
So , let us begin .
Your weapons are heavy and cum@@ ber@@ some ,
Use this to your advantage .
A grown war@@ ri@@ or cannot block
N@@ or can they use its weight to ha@@ sten their speed .
Use your w@@ its .
Be bra@@ ve and resol@@ ute .
It must be the Code .
But . I re@@ fra@@ ined from w@@ anton off@@ ense .
I spoke the truth at all times .
I per@@ sever@@ ed ..
&quot; Hon@@ or those you love . &quot;
Alex .
How could you do this ?
The police have been looking for you .
I &apos;ve been wor@@ ried sick .
Oh , thank God you &apos;re back .
M@@ um , I &apos;ve got something to tell you .
We went on a qu@@ est to Tin@@ ta@@ gel .
I met my A@@ unt S@@ ophie .
I know . She called .
I know you lied to me about the book .
I know ...
he didn &apos;t even sign it .
Quick@@ ly now .
This boy has a very important announcement .
My name is Alexander El@@ li@@ ot .
A few days ago , I found a sword in a stone .
Then I found out it wasn &apos;t just any sword in a stone ,
Exc@@ ali@@ b@@ ur .
I know , I know , I know it sounds ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous ,
This boy , Mer@@ tin ,
And if you don &apos;t believe me ,
How hum@@ ili@@ ating .
Gu@@ iet . Qu@@ iet . Listen .
This country is in danger .
Then you must destroy her so that she can never return .
It won &apos;t be easy , Alex .
We can do it , Mer@@ lin .
We don &apos;t have any choice .
We have to do it .
All batt@@ ali@@ ons , stand by .
This is it . Good luck .
Pre@@ pare for battle ! Pre@@ pare for battle !
They &apos;re through the gates .
Wa@@ it for it . Wa@@ it for it .
Now ! Go ! Go ! Go !
Go ! Go !
Amazon Expedition , day seven .
Two thousand miles from Rio .
we &apos;ve reached the center of the rain@@ forest .
We are surrounded by plants and animals ...
strug@@ gling for survival
with the last remaining family living under protection .
at the Bl@@ u Bird Sanc@@ tuary in Rio de Janeiro .
We &apos;re famous !
1@@ f these birds can be found , their home will be saved
And if there is , we will find them and protect them .
Hi , Bl@@ u !
Hi , Lin@@ da !
We &apos;re not the only ones .
All this time , I thought ..
I thought we were alone .
H@@ ey , it has@@ n &apos;t been all bad .
Of course not .
But just imagine if there was a whole flo@@ ck of us .
How amazing would that be ?
We got@@ ta do something .
We do ?
Ye@@ ah , we have to fly to the Amazon and help Lin@@ da and Tu@@ lio find them !
Who@@ a , we can &apos;t just pack up and go .
Why not ?
It &apos;s about time this family got a little air under our wings
We &apos;re not people , we &apos;re birds .
We have to get out into the wild and be birds , Bl@@ u .
They need this . We need this .
Come on , Bl@@ u , what do you say ?
T don &apos;t know
He didn &apos;t say &quot; no . &quot;
Ye@@ ah !
We &apos;re going to the Amazon !
Wa@@ it . What &apos;s the Amazon ?
The Amazon is one of Earth &apos;s most end@@ anger@@ ed ecos@@ ystems ..
due to illegal log@@ ging and farming
can find these rare birds so their home can be saved
And if there is , we will find them and protect them .
That would be me . Ok@@ ay , everybody can go home now .
You &apos;re looking at the next King of Car@@ nival !
H@@ ey , big bird ! Bre@@ ak a leg !
Walk it off , bud@@ dy !
You can &apos;t see it coming
Eva , dar@@ ling , you hit every note . Hu@@ h , guys ?
Ye@@ ah , along with a b@@ unch of notes I never heard of
Don &apos;t worry . I &apos;ll talk to them .
You catch my dri@@ ft ?
No , I &apos;m not here to au@@ dition . I &apos;ve got news .
I am going to the Amazon .
Y@@ ay .
The Amazon ? Wo@@ w , that &apos;s wild .
I &apos;ll be in charge of this .
That &apos;s not for you .
H@@ ey , D@@ ad , look at this .
Did you know the Amazon has sn@@ akes that can swal@@ low you whole ?
Actually , B@@ ia , all those stories are highly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ated .
No , really . Look .
That &apos;s sick !
All right , bird . P@@ ick a fort@@ une .
Come on , bird .
You &apos;re doing great , Ni@@ gel .
FP@@ ick it already .
Come on , gang . Almost there .
No more flying today . We &apos;ve got a boat to catch .
According to my little friend here , this boat will get us there by morning .
Two million square miles of jung@@ le ..
and they &apos;re playing in my back@@ yard ?
don &apos;t think so .
As you know , my friends , this log@@ ging operation is a little .
illegal .
If those two nuts find those birds , we &apos;re out of business .
And that &apos;s why you
Find them and get rid of them .
The rest of you , go cut some trees .
For years , we have been on the run
But as you can see , we have found sanc@@ tuary .
A place we can finally put down roots .
Everyone ! Come on ! Everyone , out of your ne@@ sts !
My daughter is home !
Come on , birds . My Je@@ wel is back !
Je@@ wel ?
Make way . Make way ! Je@@ wel !
A@@ unt M@@ im@@ i ? A@@ unt M@@ im@@ i !
I missed you so much !
My little wild@@ flower has returned !
I knew you were coming back . I saw it in the dro@@ pp@@ ings .
And look at the little ones !
and have the best Car@@ nival show ever .
I am inspired !
Sorry to break it to you , city boys .
but you &apos;ll have to find some other talent .
No@@ body leaves the tri@@ be .
And no human things in the jung@@ le . Under@@ stood ?
What ? : What &apos;s his problem ?
I feel naked
We already are super@@ -@@ meg@@ a-@@ d@@ ope , but .
You know what I &apos;m saying ?
Thank you , but we &apos;re fine .
Besides , our whole family couldn &apos;t possibly fit in your bach@@ el@@ or pad
Real estate must be pretty cheap around here .
Wo@@ w . This is incredible .
This old nest ? It &apos;s just something I put together last minute .
With my own two wings , of course .
And my strength .
I can bar@@ ely look at it . You got@@ ta lose that human pocket , ok@@ ay ?
This is a f@@ anny pack .
&quot; F@@ anny pack . &quot; Ad@@ orable
I &apos;ll meet you by the clay banks .
&quot; Jo@@ ining the tri@@ be &quot; ?
He doesn &apos;t actually think we &apos;re moving to the jung@@ le , does he ?
No . He &apos;s just excited we &apos;re all here .
Let &apos;s not ru@@ in the moment , ok@@ ay ?
Besides , it won &apos;t kill you to leave behind the f@@ anny pack .
All right , you win . I will leave the f@@ anny pack behind .
Happy wife , happy li
Fa@@ ve fun .
Ye@@ ah . S@@ ure . B@@ ye .
W@@ ake up !
Eva ! You got it !
What happened to &quot; Amazon Un@@ t@@ amed &quot; ?
Here &apos;s the plan . Au@@ ditions today ...

&quot; We &quot; ? What you talking about , &quot; we &quot; ? You speak French ?
Come on , ch@@ op@@ -@@ cho@@ p . Let &apos;s get started !
K@@ id &apos;s been working .
Any time you &apos;re ready .
Every time I come a f@@ ella got@@ ta get it
We are the amazing Cap@@ o@@ eira Tur@@ tles .
We &apos;re here on our hon@@ ey@@ moon .
We &apos;re actually just heading back to join the tour .
It &apos;s kar@@ ao@@ ke night .
Come along , honey . Moon River isn &apos;t going to sing itself .
Lin@@ da , lo@@ gs aren &apos;t the only things these guys cut .
Ye@@ ah , that &apos;s actually why I &apos;m here .

H@@ o , I don &apos;t think so . No . I &apos;m ..
Bob . Z@@ es . Bob , the bird .
Ok@@ ay , Bob , whatever . Show us what you got .
Well , at first I was afraid
Did you think I &apos;d cr@@ um@@ ble ?
Oh , no !
Did you think I &apos;d lay down and die ?
We &apos;ll see you at the performance tomorrow night .
Everyone from the village is coming . It &apos;s gon@@ na be off the charts .
Everyone ?
It &apos;s the perfect plan .
Be happy we &apos;re only plu@@ cking you , por@@ c@@ up@@ ine .
Go away .
Instead of ch@@ asing that bird all over the jung@@ le ..
we let him come to us , at the Car@@ nival show
you , my little Gab@@ i ...
you &apos;ll be my peti@@ te weapon of mass destruction .
It will be a performance ...
to die for .
It only works when I do it .
Ok@@ ay . Love you .
H@@ ey , swe@@ e@@ tie , there you are . What &apos;s taking you so long ?
En@@ ough with that GPS , really .
The whole tri@@ be &apos;s gathering to watch the sun@@ set . Come on .
No , no . H@@ ang on . I just found Lin@@ da and Tu@@ lio &apos;s coordinates .
They are Just on the other side of the gro@@ ve
but I &apos;m sure if he met them , he would change his mind .
They can help keep this place safe .
Ye@@ ah , Bl@@ u ...
my dad knows what he &apos;s doing
But I thought that was our plan .
Route guidance complete .
You know , maybe some places sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be found .
Maybe they should just be left alone .
She ate a bug . A bug !
Cal@@ m down ? We had a plan .
Help Lin@@ da and Tu@@ lio find the flo@@ ck and get home .
But when I mentioned it to her , she completely shut me down .
And her father ? A total nut job .
He &apos;s got this wei@@ rd thing about humans !
He loves them . He &apos;s a pet !
A pet ?
He called me a pet .
I can &apos;t believe he used the &quot; P &apos; word to my face .
It &apos;s like he thinks I &apos;m the enemy or something .
He &apos;s not one of us , Rober@@ to . Keep an eye on him .
And that Rober@@ to ? He is always watching .
He is always ho@@ ver@@ ing around Je@@ wel . He is always singing something
You got@@ ta bird up , bird !
Try to see this place through her eyes .
Taste the fla@@ vors she &apos;s ta@@ sting
That &apos;s Just n@@ asty , thinking about it .
G@@ litter . Where is my gli@@ tter ?
I &apos;m sorry . Sorry .
I don &apos;t want ap@@ ologies . I want gli@@ tter .
G@@ litter is absolutely essential for a magical performance .
Do you know nothing ?
Gu@@ ys !
Reh@@ ear@@ s@@ als , big day tomorrow .
Ring a bell ? Come on . You &apos;re coming , right , D@@ ad ?
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah , of course .
That girl put the &quot; business &quot; in &quot; show business . &quot;
I know , I know . Happy wife , happy life .
What a gl@@ orious morning !
I forgot I could have mor@@ nings like this .
No , no . Don &apos;t do it
Thank you .
Finally !
Brazil nuts .
This is my most important tool .
Well , well , well . What do we have here ?
I gu@@ ess old Ed@@ die &apos;s rules don &apos;t apply to everyone .
I didn &apos;t know that . Sorry .
Sorry ! Sorry .
You come over here , take our food .
and now you ins@@ ult me ?
No , no , no . This is all just a big mis@@ understanding .
You know , I wish I could accept your ap@@ ology .
You seem like a nice bird
What ? Does it have to ? Can it mean something else ?
I hope you don &apos;t mind .
I made myself at home .
L@@ ol@@ li@@ pop ?
It &apos;s a sh@@ ame , really . You came all this way to protect the jung@@ le .
Jet &apos;s see if it will return the favor .
A new player is coming off the ben@@ ch . Is he a secret weapon ?
I think it &apos;s the water boy .
H@@ ey , I &apos;m open !
I &apos;m open , t@@ oss it to me !
H@@ ey , pass to me , I &apos;m open . I &apos;m wide open !

Go@@ al !
It looks like the secret weapon just back@@ fired !
Let &apos;s go to Edu@@ ardo for his reaction .
I &apos;m gon@@ na kill you , f@@ anny pack !
Check it out , old Ed@@ die
We &apos;re gon@@ na be talking about that for a long time
H@@ ey .
What happened back there ?
I was trying to be one of the tri@@ be .
We still got it , Bl@@ u !
I have to do everything myself .
H@@ ey ! Get away from that !
No ! No one ste@@ als my scene .
L@@ ol@@ li@@ pop ?
Y@@ ha ?
What are you doing ? Let go !
Save yourself !
Come on , let go !
And no psycho@@ -@@ on-@@ wheels is gon@@ na change that .
And I &apos;ll tell you something else .
He &apos;d better not show his face around here ever again .
What &apos;s wrong ?
The last time I spoke to Or@@ son ,
Oh , swe@@ e@@ tie .
And I should have done something .
Is that for me ? Ah@@ em .
Can I open it ?
H@@ ey , I know this tri@@ ck , and if I let you open it today ,
That &apos;s totally what I &apos;m going to do .
And I am totally gon@@ na fall for it .
What ...
Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t you w@@ anna finish our conversation ?
Another time . Just enjoy the champagne .
You had to get the girls a cat , didn &apos;t you ?
H@@ ey , that is medi@@ cally veri@@ fied .
Girls , show m@@ omm@@ y how sad we &apos;d be
Oh , how could I say &quot; no &quot; to such sad
D@@ ad@@ dy , you w@@ anna see him do a tri@@ ck ?
Kit@@ ty , f@@ etch .
Now come back .
Ru@@ f@@ us ?
Hello .
Is that a gun in your pocket ,
Oh , my god . It is a gun .
You &apos;ve got a gun in your pocket ?
Sus@@ an , don &apos;t fre@@ ak out .
Why do you have a gun ?
S@@ it down .
What does that tell ya ?
I don &apos;t ... I don &apos;t know if I could do that .
I don &apos;t want to die alone . B@@ ree .
And the chem@@ o &apos;s just k@@ icking my ass .
I don &apos;t want to waste away in some hospital bed .
Please help me go the way@@ I want to .
All right .
Sorry to keep you waiting , Mr. And Mrs. Del@@ fin@@ o .
Oh , and by &quot; help him out , &quot; he means
He does .
Do you know it &apos;s illegal to ass@@ ault someone ?
The guy was breaking into our neighb@@ or &apos;s house .
I tried to get him to leave , he thre@@ w a p@@ unch ,
I &apos;m starting to think that a tie
Oh , honey .
You &apos;re not nervous about your first day back , are you ?
I don &apos;t know .
I just thought I &apos;d be more excited than I am .
Well , you &apos;re the b@@ oss .
You want excit@@ ement , sha@@ ke things up .
Buy a new x@@ ero@@ x machine
Ok@@ ay .
What are you doing ?
Just making sure I &apos;m in the memory book .
You &apos;re inv@@ ading every photo that Penn@@ y and I are in .
I &apos;m her mother . Maybe you &apos;re the inv@@ ader .
And we &apos;re back to this .
I spent weeks planning this party ,
I &apos;m just trying to for@@ ge a relationship with Penn@@ y .
Well , stop for@@ ging . You &apos;re not family .
You &apos;re just some woman her father is ..
&quot; Se@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; Well , &quot; What ?
Well ...
That &apos;s not all I am .
What does that mean ?
You know , you should probably talk to Tom .
I have to understand it .
What is it ?
I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m still trying to understand it .
I thought you understood everything .
Of course not ,
I speci@@ alise .
And what &apos;s so important about this ?
What &apos;s so important about five bor@@ ing mur@@ ders ?
Out ? At this hour of the morning ?
Yes , si@@ r . Did you not know that , si@@ r ?
Where did she go ? She &apos;s always out these days .
Not unlike yourself ... si@@ r .
I &apos;m sorry .. ?
It &apos;s a family tra@@ it .
Oh , I wasn &apos;t being critical .
If you continue like this , si@@ r ,
Five ? We thought three ,
I &apos;m still inc@@ lined to four .
As ever , you see but you do not observe .
Yes , you &apos;re right . I &apos;m changing my bet to three years ,
A bet ? !
I understand your dis@@ approval , Wat@@ son ,
That &apos;s a risk you &apos;ll have to take .
You &apos;re gam@@ bling with your own life ?
Why not ? It &apos;s so much more exciting than gam@@ bling with others &apos; .
Lady Car@@ m@@ ich@@ ael &apos;s case , what is it ?
Rest assured , it has features of interest .
I never really say that .
You really do .
And you &apos;ve solved it already , I assume ?
But the Bri@@ de , Hol@@ mes ,
A dead woman walking the earth .
You am@@ a@@ ze me , Wat@@ son .
I do ?
Since when have you had any kind of imagination ?
Perhaps since I convinced the reading public that
Yes , now you come to mention it , that was quite impressive .
You may , however , rest assured there are no gh@@ o@@ sts in this world .
Save those we make for ourselves .
Sorry , what did you say ?
G@@ hosts we make for ourselves , what do you mean ?
It &apos;s a common enough condition .
I thought you were a doctor !
The whole thing was a .... bad dream .
Inclu@@ ding the contents of the en@@ vel@@ ope you received ?
Well , that &apos;s a gro@@ tes@@ que jo@@ ke .
She married you .
I assume she was capable of finding a reason .
I &apos;ll do my best to save your life ton@@ ight ,
Ric@@ ol@@ etti ?
Yes . In detail , please .
I &apos;ve never heard of her .
Inter@@ esting . I didn &apos;t mention she was a woman .
We &apos;ll show ourselves out . I hope to see you again in the morning .
You will not .
Then s@@ adly I shall be solving your murder . Good day .
Well , you tried .
Will you see that Lady Car@@ m@@ ich@@ ael receives this . Thank you .
Good afternoon .
Cer@@ tain@@ ly , si@@ r .
What was that ?
Lady Car@@ m@@ ich@@ ael will sleep alone ton@@ ight ,
All the doors and windows of the house will be locked .
You think the spec@@ tre , er , Bri@@ de ,
H@@ mm , it &apos;s difficult to say quite what he &apos;ll do .
Gu@@ ilt is eating away at his soul .
Gu@@ ilt ? About what ?
Some@@ thing in his past . The orange pi@@ ps were a remin@@ der .
Not a jo@@ ke ?
Not at all .
Orange pi@@ ps are a traditional warning of av@@ eng@@ ing death ,
Sir Eu@@ st@@ ace knows this only too well ,
Some@@ thing to do with E@@ mel@@ ia Ric@@ ol@@ etti ?
I pres@@ ume .
We all have a past , Wat@@ son . G@@ hosts .
They are the sh@@ adows that define our every sunny day .
Sir Eu@@ st@@ ace knows he &apos;s a marked man .
There &apos;s something more than murder he fears .
You think so ?
No . You think so . I could tell .
On the contrary , I have no view on the matter .
Yes , you have .
Mar@@ riage is not a subject upon which I d@@ well .
Oh , why not ?
What &apos;s the matter with you this evening ?
From a retired army sur@@ geon , most certainly .
Hol@@ mes , against absolutely no opposition wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever ,
I conc@@ ede it .
I am currently attemp@@ ting to have a perfectly
Please don &apos;t .
Why do you need to be alone ?
What did you just say ?
Sorry ?
About a note , what did you just say ?
I said the mur@@ derer DI@@ D leave a note .
No , they didn &apos;t .
Why do you make him tea ?
I dun@@ no , I just sort of do .
He said , &quot; There &apos;s only one susp@@ ect , &quot; and then he just walks away
Which is strange , because he likes that bit .
Sa@@ id it was so simple I could solve it .
I &apos;m sure he was ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating .
I &apos;d be offen@@ ded if you didn &apos;t .
Ob@@ viously , I &apos;ve returned the cour@@ tes@@ y .
I like your rooms .
They smell so ...
man@@ ly .
I &apos;m sure you acquain@@ ted yourself with them before now .
Well , you are always away ,
Tell me , does the illustr@@ ator travel with you ?
Do you have to pose ... during your de@@ duc@@ tions ?
I &apos;m aware of all six occasions you have visited these apartments
To dist@@ rac@@ t me , der@@ ail me .
Because doesn &apos;t this remind you of another case ?
Has@@ n &apos;t this all happened before ?
There &apos;s nothing new under the sun . What was it ?
What was it ? What was that case ?
Do you remember ?
For the sake of Mrs Hu@@ dson &apos;s wallpaper , I must remind you
I &apos;m sorry ?
Dead ... is the new sexy .
Well , I &apos;ll tell you what , that rather b@@ lows the co@@ b@@ web@@ s away .
How can you be alive ?
How do I look ?
You can be honest , is it notic@@ eable ?
You ble@@ w your own bra@@ ins out , how could you survive ?
Well , a somewhat shorter ex@@ ile
I have to go back !
What ?
I was ... I was nearly there , I nearly had it !
What on earth are you talking about ?
Go back where ? You didn &apos;t get very far .
Ric@@ ol@@ etti and his ab@@ om@@ in@@ able wife ! Don &apos;t you understand ? !
It was a case , a famous one from 100 years ago .
Lo@@ dged in my hard drive ,
What , like M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty ?
S@@ hot herself in the head , exactly like M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty .
But you &apos;ve only just been told .
We &apos;ve only just found out ,
Yes ? So ? It &apos;s been five minutes since My@@ cro@@ ft called .
What progress have you made ? What have you been doing ?
More to the point , what have YO@@ U been doing ?
I &apos;ve been in my M@@ ind Palace , of course .
Of course .
R@@ unn@@ in@@ q an experiment . How would I have solved the crime ,
Oh , Sher@@ lock .
I had all the details perfect .
I was there , all of it , everything . I was immer@@ sed .
Do you really think anyone is belie@@ ving you ?
No , he can do this , I &apos;ve seen it .
The M@@ ind Palace , it &apos;s like a whole world in his head .
Yes , and I need to get back there .
The M@@ ind Palace is a memory technique , I know what it can do
Maybe there are one or two things that I know that you don &apos;t .
Oh , there are .
Did you make a list ?
You &apos;ve put on weight .
That wa@@ ist@@ coat is clearly new@@ er than the jacket .
Stop this ! Just stop it ! Did you make a list ? !
Of what ?
Everything , Sher@@ lock . Everything you &apos;ve taken .
No , it &apos;s not that , he goes into a sort of tran@@ ce .
I &apos;ve seen him do it .
We have an agreement , my brother and I , ever since that day .
Wher@@ ever I find him ,
I &apos;m not an ad@@ dict , I &apos;m a user .
I alle@@ vi@@ ate bor@@ e@@ dom and
For God &apos;s sake ! This could kill you !
You could die !
Control@@ led usage is not usually fat@@ al
E@@ mel@@ ia Ric@@ ol@@ etti , I &apos;m looking her up .
Oh , I supp@@ ose we should .
I have access to the top level of the MI@@ 5 archive .
Y@@ ep , that &apos;s where I &apos;m looking .
What do you think of MI@@ 5 security ?
I think it would be a good idea .
E@@ mel@@ ia Ric@@ ol@@ etti , &quot; Un@@ solved , &quot;
C@@ ould you all just shut up for five minutes !
I have to go back .
I was nearly there before
&quot; Y@@ apping ? &quot; Sorry , did we interrup@@ t your session ?
Sher@@ lock , listen to me .
Mr Hol@@ mes asked me .
Hol@@ mes , how could you ?
No , not him , the cle@@ ver one .
It seemed obvious to me
My theory is that Mrs Ric@@ ol@@ etti had help .
Help from her friends .
Bra@@ vo , Mary . &quot; The cle@@ ver one ? &quot;
Well , you &apos;re the one who moved out .
I was talking to Mary .
You &apos;re working for My@@ cro@@ ft ?
He likes to keep an eye on his mad si@@ bling .
And he had a sp@@ y to hand . Has it never occurred to you
Of course it has@@ n &apos;t ,
When did it occur to you ?
Only now , I &apos;m afraid .
M@@ ust be difficult ,
Time I sp@@ ed up . En@@ ough ch@@ atter , let &apos;s concentrate .
Yes , all right . What &apos;s all this about ?
What do they want to ac@@ comp@@ lish ?
Why don &apos;t we go and find out .
All that remained was to sub@@ stitute the real Mrs. Ric@@ ol@@ etti
This time , should anyone attempt to identify her ,
But why would she do that ?
Die to prove a point ?
Every great cause has mart@@ yr@@ s .
Every war has suicide missions and make no mistake , this is war .
One half of the human race at war with the other .
The invisible army ho@@ ver@@ ing at our el@@ bow ,
Not allowed so much as a vote .
But an army non@@ etheless ,
To put right an in@@ justice as old as humanity itself .
So you see , Wat@@ son , My@@ cro@@ ft was right .
This is a war we must lose .
She was dying .
Who was ?
E@@ mel@@ ia Ric@@ ol@@ etti .
There were clear signs of consumption -
So she decided to make her death count .
Left her abandoned and p@@ enn@@ il@@ ess .
Ho@@ oper !
Hol@@ mes .
For the record , Hol@@ mes , she didn &apos;t have me fo@@ ol@@ ed .
Why do you never mention me , si@@ r ?
Yes .
That would take weeks to find , if those records even exists .
Even with my resources .
G@@ ot it .
I don &apos;t get it , how is this relevant ?
I need to know I was right , then I &apos;ll be sure .
You mean how M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty did it ?
Yes .
But none of that really happened , it was in your head .
My investigation was the fant@@ asy ,
I don &apos;t know what you think you &apos;ll find here .
I need to try !
Mrs Ric@@ ol@@ etti was buried here ,
The cor@@ p@@ se they sub@@ stit@@ uted for her after the so-called suicide ?
They &apos;d move it , of course they would .
But where ?
Well , not here .
But that .. that &apos;s exactly what they must have done .
The con@@ spir@@ ators had someone on the inside .
They found a body ,
You &apos;re not seriously going to do this ?
It &apos;s why we came here . I need to know .
Sp@@ o@@ ken like an ad@@ dict .
This is important to me !
No , this is you ne@@ eding a fix .
John ...
M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty &apos;s back .
We have a case , we have a real-@@ life problem right now .
Get@@ ting to that , it &apos;s next on the list .
Just let me do this .
No , everyone always lets you do whatever you want .
That &apos;s how you got in this state !
John , please ..
I &apos;m not playing this time , Sher@@ lock . Not any more !
When you &apos;re ready to go to work , give me a call .
I &apos;m taking Mary home .
You &apos;re what ?
No ...
More than likely .
At any rate , it was a very long time ago .
We do have slightly more pressing matters to hand , little brother .
M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty ? Back from the dead ?
Look at that guy in the ch@@ ute .
Fans , we &apos;re gon@@ na go now to the Ri@@ din &apos; Dir@@ ty bu@@ cking ch@@ ute ..
where we have got local hero Luke Coll@@ ins
Go , u@@ ke !
He &apos;s a three-@@ time P@@ B@@ R World Fin@@ als champion .
For over a year , an injury has si@@ del@@ ined him .
But he &apos;s back
He has a long way to go .
You ready for this ?
We &apos;ll see .
And today , he will be riding Sweet Th@@ ang
Ye@@ ah , go !
H@@ ey , bud@@ dy . I &apos;ll be right back .
H@@ ey , Lar@@ ry .
Good to see you . Good to see you here .
Luke , h@@ ey , man . How are you doing ?
Con@@ grat@@ ulations , man .
I know it feels good to get a win under your belt , doesn &apos;t it ?
S@@ ure does . Ye@@ ah .
Let me ask you . You need to come visit us .
I w@@ anna introduce you to some good fol@@ ks from P@@ B@@ R .
Important folk . Come get a beer .
You got it . I &apos;ll be right behind you .
Yes . Ok@@ ay .
H@@ ey , um ...
You had a good night .
But it &apos;s a long way back to the top .
I got a hat just like that .
Ye@@ ah . Sorry .
No , you hold on to it . L@@ ooks better on you .
Like this ?
May I ?
Sop@@ hia .
Nice to meet you , Sop@@ hia .
I &apos;m gon@@ na .. Can I ... Can I get you a drink ?
You were the big winner ton@@ ight , right ?
I think I should be the one buying you a beer .
Oh , no . Do@@ esn &apos;t work like that where I &apos;m from .
Ok@@ ay .
You &apos;re buying
Hi ! Who@@ a . There you are .
I &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
Um , this is Mar@@ cia . She &apos;s my ..
before she comes by .
You really should eat something
T@@ s that what R@@ uth would want ?
How do you know about R@@ uth ?
Did you read my letters ?
What do you care ?
But yet , with my most important student .
I am a total failure .
R@@ uth has fallen in love with contemporary art .
Father thinks that art stopped with M@@ atis@@ se and Pic@@ asso .
I don &apos;t think it stopped . But it &apos;s taken a long n@@ ap .
You try and raise your children right , I@@ ra ...
and they grow up and think for themselves .
Very good . Very good .
It &apos;s trage@@ dy !
It was nice seeing you talk like that .
Nothing would make me happ@@ ier than a lifetime of days like this .
H@@ ey , R@@ uth . I need to ask you something .
I want a big family . A really big family .
I &apos;ve always wanted one since I was a little girl .
With everything that &apos;s going on now ..
I feel this need , this responsibility ,
So@@ unds perfect .
You can ask me now
Don &apos;t know the last thing about art .
I want to mar@@ ry you .
If you mar@@ ry me , you may never have a family .
Are you hon@@ est@@ ly willing to give that up ?
The war was over .
and as far as I was concerned
We &apos;re closed !
I know what you &apos;re doing !
You cannot tell me what I &apos;m willing to give up !
When you went to war ...
I was here , cl@@ ing@@ ing to the hope ..
that you would come home and we would get married .
Yes , and have kids . But that &apos;s a dream , I@@ ra .
Z@@ oul &apos;re real
Un@@ less you don &apos;t love me anymore .
And in that moment
a chance at life together
It was really nice of you to bring that photo .
He sure has been through a lot .
Well , you take it easy .
IL@@ ul@@ ke .
It was really good to see you .
What are you doing right now ?
That looks good .
No , they didn &apos;t adjust anything
Everyone was always scre@@ aming in wei@@ rd languages .
I brought sm@@ el@@ ly , strange snacks to school .
My p@@ ants were too short always .
P@@ ants still are too short .
Gro@@ wing up on a cattle ran@@ ch , everybody I knew was the same .
Every@@ body you know is fourth generation cattle ran@@ chers .
I &apos;m je@@ al@@ ous .
Why ?
I wanted to be like everyone else when I was little
You &apos;re not so bad yourself .
I think before I met you , the closest thing I came to cattle was
From one happy day to the next .
You said you love the house , right ?
We began the process of creating a life together .
Do@@ esn &apos;t look like anyone &apos;s home .
No , I don &apos;t think you should go in .
They say all b@@ ull riders are either st@@ up@@ id or crazy .
Ye@@ ah , and which one are you ?
I don &apos;t know . I gu@@ ess a little of both .
What are you doing ?
This is a new painting by an artist that Adri@@ enne Francis represents .
I know you have fin@@ als and other commitments .
I &apos;d love to . This is the most important thing to me .
Oh ! U@@ h , Luke , hi .
This is Adri@@ enne Francis
Nice to meet you , Ms. Francis .
Nice to meet you , Luke .
Are you in college with Sop@@ hia ?
No , never made it to college .
Luke &apos;s a professional b@@ ull ri@@ der .
Are you an art lover , like Sop@@ hia ?
No , I can &apos;t say that I am .
What did you think of ton@@ ight ?
Hon@@ est@@ ly ?
Of course .
think there &apos;s more bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it here than where I work
It was a jo@@ ke .
You know how hard I have just tried to fit into your world .
Why can &apos;t you try to fit into mine ?
I do !
It was a jo@@ ke , ok@@ ay ? She thought it was funny .
She laugh@@ ed . You don &apos;t know that .
What if she was just trying to be poli@@ te ?
Does this make sense ?
W@@ ha@@ c ?
How are we gon@@ na make this work , hu@@ h ?
Do you really see yourself living on a ran@@ ch ?
Working a ran@@ ch the rest of your life ?
And what am I gon@@ na do ?
Mo@@ ve to Manhattan ?
Go out with your artist friends ? Go to br@@ unch ?
Because they &apos;re his legal gu@@ ardi@@ ans .
There &apos;s nothing we can do .
Did you speak to the lawyer ?
I did , and that &apos;s what he said
They &apos;re his next of kin and they &apos;re proud people
There must be something more we can do .
We better go .
You be good . Ok@@ ay , p@@ al ?
Ok@@ ay .
Maybe I &apos;ll raise ch@@ ick@@ ens ..
or work at the factory .
If that &apos;s what you want .
You can be anything you want , Daniel Mc@@ Donald .
Any@@ thing at all . A far@@ mer , a lawyer , an astronom@@ er .
You &apos;re a very cle@@ ver boy .
Come on . We wouldn &apos;t have had a chance !
And who knows what they would &apos;ve done to Daniel .
We are a family .
R@@ uth , you are my family .
I wanted kids too , you know .
We never saw Daniel again .
Oh , my God .
Oh , sh@@ it .
Luke Coll@@ ins is trying to come around .
The b@@ ull fighter &apos;s taking the b@@ ull away in the other direction .
I think he &apos;s gon@@ na be ok@@ ay . He &apos;s trying to get up . He is !
Let me get him something to make him feel a little bit better .
92 points !
26@@ 4 on three bul@@ ls !
Luke Coll@@ ins is your cle@@ ar-@@ cut winner .
T@@ e &apos;s a@@ wesome .
Number nine spot in the world .
You impressed Adri@@ enne , you &apos;ll im@@ press her team .
Ok@@ ay . Got@@ ta go .
This is what you &apos;ve always wanted !
I know !
B@@ ye ! See you on Monday .
H@@ ey , babe . I &apos;m walking to the taxi right now .
Sop@@ hia , it &apos;s Lu@@ iz .
Hi , Lu@@ iz . Some@@ thing &apos;s happened to Luke .
Hi , can I help you ?
Um , I need to see my boy@@ friend , Luke Coll@@ ins .
I &apos;m sorry . Only family can visit .
Ok@@ ay . Can I at least know how he is ?
His condition is stable , but he &apos;s getting an MI@@ R@@ I .
He took a pretty hard fall .
If you w@@ anna take a seat , I &apos;ll check with the doctor .
I &apos;ll let you know .
Thank you .
So , are you ligh@@ t-@@ headed , di@@ zz@@ y ?
Nau@@ sea ?
I &apos;d like you to stay overnight for observation .
Swe@@ e@@ tie . What are you doing here ?
I came as soon as I heard
No , no .
should be here .
Thank God you &apos;re ok@@ ay .
I understand you can &apos;t meet the team this weekend , 9@@ i@@ ven the circum@@ stance ,
Ye@@ ah , me , too .
I don &apos;t know when I &apos;m gon@@ na be able to come to New York .
Oh , really ?
Wa@@ it a minute . You &apos;re not re@@ thinking the intern@@ ship , are you ?
Look , Sop@@ hia .
I think you have a bright future ahead of you .
but you &apos;re going to have to figure out for yourself what that &apos;s going to be .
Now , I love you with everything inside of me .
I think you should go .
I love you so much , I just want you to be happy .
Even if that happiness no longer includes me .
Love requires sacrifice .
Always .
And from that day on , Sop@@ hia ,
We focused on celeb@@ rating all the wonderful things we had
even though I saw her every day .
Ru@@ th@@ ie
But , of course , not nearly enough .
The paintings R@@ uth and I had collected
So I packed them away .
Can I help you ?
My name is Andrea Mc@@ Donald
Dam@@ iel Mc@@ Donald
A brain an@@ eur@@ ys@@ m .

I &apos;m very sorry to hear that .
Thank you .

Astronom@@ y .
I moved back to the States a few years ago .
When I saw your wife &apos;s ob@@ itu@@ ary in the paper .
I knew I had to bring you this .
It meant a lot to him .
You did everything you could with Luke , Sop@@ hia .
Where are you gon@@ na live ?
If we don &apos;t have this place , where are you gon@@ na go ?
Do you hon@@ est@@ ly think I give a dam@@ n ?
You &apos;re doing this for yourself .
It &apos;s eight seconds .
That &apos;s all it is .
That girl could be the rest of your life
U@@ h , yes . This is she .
My name is How@@ ie S@@ anders . I &apos;m the att@@ orney for I@@ ra Lev@@ inson .

Not only are these pieces sourc@@ ed from local Black Mountain College ..
but the world
such as Andy War@@ hol , P@@ at Pass@@ l@@ of , and Wil@@ lem de X@@ o@@ oning

Never been seen in one place like this before .
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen
If everyone could take their seats , please .
I know we are all e@@ ager to get started .
Before we begin , a personal note .
I was R@@ uth and I@@ ra Lev@@ inson &apos;s att@@ orney ...

And sharing that happiness ...
was the great privil@@ ege of my life .
We celebrated , we achieved
And above all
Com@@ posed by American Daniel Mc@@ Donald
We &apos;ll start the bi@@ dding at $ 1,000 for Portrait of R@@ uth .

Who has $ 1,000 for me ?
How about $ 800 ? Who can give me $ 800 ?
Just $ 600 , fol@@ ks .

Like , and if someone who &apos;s trying to kill you , goes , &quot; Wa@@ it .. &quot;
Please just don &apos;t y@@ ell at me , ok@@ ay ?

I just think that maybe we need to figure out what the fu@@ ck we &apos;re doing
We made it out of there . Ok@@ ay ?
And nothing else is going to happen , I promise .
Let &apos;s just get in my car
don &apos; understand
Why would you .. I should not be talking .
Listen to me . I need a weapon .

Why don &apos;t you go to your house ?
Cra@@ zy is as crazy does and you dra@@ gged crazy here .
And I con &apos;t even know what that does or what that is .

The CD@@ C has said a break@@ out of what is being described
The bridge into town has been blocked with access in or out of the town ....

That &apos;s not real . That can &apos;t .
trac@@ ed back to these two individuals .
We are escap@@ ing .
Pho@@ e@@ be . No , Pho@@ e@@ be , stop .
I really don &apos;t think we should do this , ok@@ ay ?
I think we should just wait here .
Rose is like a really good guy , he &apos;ll come around .
You &apos;ll see . He &apos;s just a sensitive and complex man .
not going to sit around
I &apos;m just going to sco@@ ot a little bit further and see if I can get into the other room .
Just give me one second .
This is not the right moment .
What do you mean , Qu@@ in@@ zin , I can &apos;t be in your league ?

T@@ Well , I gu@@ ess it all worked out .
Because ook where I am now .

So I shut it down ,
A fresh start here .

You are going to use logic and reason
St@@ ev@@ ens will make sad cancer eyes .
And if all of that doesn &apos;t work , K@@ are@@ v , you &apos;re gon@@ na pull out
Slo@@ an you should still have time to work on the arm

We &apos;ll run to city hall , we &apos;ll come back . And we &apos;ll do it then .
Mer@@ edi@@ th ..

Try and get a little sleep .
Sle@@ ep sc@@ ares me .
Well , dream of me .
But not in these p@@ ants .

We are being told rescue teams are still searching for survi@@ vors .
The death toll is at 144 and still rising .
of Britain in as many months .
And all signs point to terrorist leader Matthias
The U@@ . F.@@ B. explo@@ its us .
The workers of The Col@@ ony des@@ erve equality .
Chancellor Co@@ ha@@ agen pointed to this as proof
And with over@@ population figures in the U@@ . F.@@ B. continuing to rise ,
You &apos;ll rec@@ all the last attack occurred six weeks ago .
Federal police have since attri@@ buted that bom@@ bing to this man , Carl Haus@@ er ,
No word yet as to whether Haus@@ er had a role in this morning &apos;s incident .
Go@@ ing somewhere ? No ?
Well , don &apos;t let that stop you .

Not anymore .
At Rek@@ all , we &apos;ll provide you
We can remember it for you .
All passengers , please report to your designated gates .
This is the final boarding call for the 7 : 15 departure .
W@@ ake up to the truth !
Co@@ ha@@ agen is counting on your compl@@ ac@@ ency .
Don &apos;t let them ship you across the Earth like cattle .
Matthias speaks the truth !
Have a nice day .
Despite recent talks between Chancellor Co@@ ha@@ agen and The Col@@ ony &apos;s governor ,
As much as I want to focus our efforts on cleaning up The Col@@ ony ,
The protection of our citizens will always come first .
Appro@@ aching core .
Please prepare for grav@@ ity re@@ vers@@ al .
Security elev@@ ated to level three . Please remain in sc@@ anners until cle@@ ared .
L@@ ooks like that bom@@ b set off a hell of a pan@@ ic up here .

All factory personnel must enter through security gate 12 .
H@@ ey , what do you know about Rek@@ all ?
That mind
Ye@@ ah .

Why is that ?
Remember Trav@@ is from shift three ?
Ye@@ ah .
Ye@@ ah , I do .
You never thought about it , just a little bit ?
I don &apos;t need to think about it .
Don &apos;t m@@ ess with your mind , man .

So take all your complaints to Chancellor Co@@ ha@@ agen .
Now , which one of you fine , up@@ standing as@@ sh@@ ol@@ es wants to train the new guy ?
Come on .
Don &apos;t look at me .
I trained the last guy you fired .
Six weeks ago , I didn &apos;t even know you .
What are you talking about ?
It &apos;s true .
Your memory was er@@ ased , your mind was im@@ planted
You keeping up , baby ?
There is no Douglas Qu@@ aid , there never was .
Are you saying I don &apos;t ...
This ..
What can I say ? I give good wife .
Deep down , did you really believe
If I &apos;m not me , then who the hell am I ?
How would I know ?
I just work here .
We can remember it for you .
Qu@@ aid must &apos;ve known we &apos;d be tracking it .
How the hell would he have known that ?
Oh , sh@@ it .
He made you look like a f@@ ool .
He &apos;d had major tac@@ tical training , si@@ r .
I wasn &apos;t made aware of that .
How the hell did he get activated ?
An agent in place told me he &apos;d gone to Rek@@ all .
been blow@@ n before they could get to him .
I &apos;m 15 minutes behind him .
If you &apos;re watching this , it means I failed to escape .
It means , it means they succeeded in giving you
Any@@ thing you think you know about your life ,
You have to believe me .
The most important thing for you to do now ,
Get to my apartment !
Just think of it . In a few hours ,
Lo@@ yal
Ru@@ th@@ less .
Now , what to do with you ?
I think we keep her .
Leave her out of this . I &apos;m in the fu@@ cking chair !
I think the world will be very interested
president of the Oc@@ tan Corporation and the world .
Let &apos;s take extra care to follow the instructions , or you &apos;ll be put to sleep .
And don &apos;t forget T@@ aco Tuesday &apos;s coming next week !
That &apos;s the day every ru@@ le-@@ following citizen gets a free tac@@ o and my love !
Have a great day , everybody !
You have a great day too , President Business .

Oh . Where did it go ?
Oh , there you are .
H@@ ey , p@@ al , I hate to tell you this ...
but , u@@ h , I don &apos;t think you &apos;re supposed to be here .
Ye@@ ah , the rules specifically state .
work site clos@@ es at 6 , it &apos;s a hard@@ -@@ hat area only .
That &apos;s not official safety orange .
&quot; T@@ f you see anything wei@@ rd , report it immediately . &quot;
You &apos;re gon@@ na m@@ elt me ? Am I gon@@ na die ?
X@@ oul &apos;ll live . You@@ l &apos;ll be fine .
President Business . I have him right here , si@@ r .
Yes , we &apos;ve told him he &apos;ll live so he doesn &apos;t try to escape , but , um ...
we &apos;re lying to him .
Wa@@ it , what did he just say ?
E@@ old still .
Wa@@ it ! There &apos;s obviously been a mi@@ x-@@ up here . You &apos;ve got the wrong .
That is gon@@ na start hur@@ ting
No , no , no !
Who@@ a . Who are you ?
It &apos;s you ?
Come with me if you w@@ anna not die .
This is so wei@@ r .. O@@ w !
You &apos;re not The Special ! You lied to me !
It really kind of depends on ...
You &apos;re not even a Master@@ Buil@@ der , are you ?
U@@ h , I mean , I know what a Master@@ Buil@@ der is .
Why don &apos;t you tell me what it is ? That way I could see if you &apos;re right .
You &apos;ve ru@@ ined the proph@@ ec@@ y .
Look , I &apos;m sorry , ok@@ ay ? You just .
You made being special sound so good .
And to think I was going to follow you to the end of the universe .
We just don &apos;t know it yet .
Qu@@ iet .
Y &apos;@@ all want a giant tur@@ key leg ?
Do you have any idea what that does to your col@@ on ?
Oh , my G
and this . And this . And this .
H@@ ey , u@@ h , listen . You think you can explain why I &apos;m dres@@ sed like this ..
and what those big words in the sky were all about ?
And , like , where we are in time .
Your home , Bri@@ ck@@ sburg , is one of many real@@ ms in the universe .
There &apos;s also this ome
a b@@ unch of others we don &apos;t need to mention .
I think I got it
tell me the whole thing again . I wasn &apos;t listening
And he st@@ ole the mysterious ..
secret super weapon called .... The Kra@@ gle !
And he hi@@ red Bad Co@@ p .
to h@@ unt down all the Master@@ Buil@@ ders , who were always changing everything
And we search for the Pi@@ ece of Resist@@ ance .
The only thing that can stop the Kra@@ gle .
Kra@@ gle . I know that .
It might have been that co@@ p . He said something about the Kra@@ gle
to end the world in three days .
I can &apos;t make any sense of it .
T@@ aco Tuesday .
I knew that was suspicious . There &apos;s no time to lose .
Well , um ..
No , but thank you .
We &apos;ve done some great work over the years together , Bad Co@@ p .
cap@@ turing all those Master@@ Buil@@ ders ...
and tor@@ turing them and wh@@ at@@ not .
Thank you , si@@ r .
Although
The one thing that can ru@@ in my plans .
The one thing that I asked you to take care of .
That &apos;s super fru@@ str@@ ating
is standing closest to me .
and throw them through this window .
and out into the infin@@ ite aby@@ ss of no@@ th@@ ingness !
I w@@ anna Go it so bad .
I know you do , si@@ r . Please don &apos;t .
And it &apos;s not just you , Bad Co@@ p , that keeps mess@@ ing up my plans .
so that everyone will stop mess@@ ing with my stuff !
Are you gon@@ na be with me .
or are you gon@@ na be stuck
SC@@ on ?
Sorry , D@@ ad .
I have a job to do .
All you have to do is blend in and act like you belong here .
Ah , perfect .
Well , hi there , I &apos;m a cow@@ boy !
B@@ ang , b@@ ang , b@@ ang@@ -@@ b@@ ang@@ -@@ b@@ ang@@ -@@ b@@ ang !
Sh@@ oot , shoot , shoot . Bul@@ let , bul@@ let , gun .
Z@@ ap , z@@ ap , z@@ ap , po@@ w . Z@@ ap , po@@ w .
What are they looking at ?
I made a mistake .
You should just be still . Act like a st@@ ool .
a b@@ unch of my friends over to watch T@@ Y ..
Not unlike this TV that Just showed up mag@@ ically .
And not everybody can fit on my one couch ..
and I thought to myself :
but as a couch ?
Intro@@ duc@@ ing the double-@@ deck@@ er couch .
So everyone could watch T@@ Y together and be bud@@ dies !
That is literally the dum@@ best thing I &apos;ve ever heard .
That idea is just the worst .
There must be something around here ..
that pro@@ ves his potential .
If The Man Ur@@ p@@ stairs chose him to be The Special
Who &apos;s The Man Up@@ stairs ? See ?
He doesn &apos;t even know about The Man Up@@ stairs .
Does he have , like , super@@ -@@ gross hands ..
that look like they &apos;re made out of big pink s@@ aus@@ ages ?
Like e@@ agle tal@@ ons mixed with squ@@ id ?
Wa@@ it . You &apos;ve seen the . ?
Who@@ a !
That &apos;s what I was just thinking about .
I had this wei@@ rd dream when I touched the Pi@@ ece .
Well , I mean , I wasn &apos;t as@@ le@@ ep , so it wasn &apos;t really a dream .
E@@ mm@@ et , you had a vision .
I did
training themselves to clear their minds enough ..
to have even a fle@@ eting gli@@ mp@@ se of The Man Up@@ stairs ..
that there is nothing in it to clear away in the first place .
With proper training
I could ?
The proph@@ ec@@ y chose you , E@@ mm@@ et .
But I can &apos;t do any of the stuff .
that the proph@@ ec@@ y says I &apos;m supposed to do .
All you have to do is to believe .
Then .
you will see everything
Yes , I am .
I think
Do you think Z@@ epp@@ el@@ ins are a bad investment ?
Any of you f@@ ell@@ as seen this guy ?
Wa@@ it a minute , partner .

Thank you .
Well , u@@ h , I know that I , for one ..
am very excited to work with you guys ...

and put this thing on the thing .
And I know it &apos;s going to be really hard , but .
&quot; Re@@ ally hard &quot;

So if ye think it &apos;d be a good idea to return .

Special .

ch@@ an the ideas of 100 .
of our fallen Master Bli@@ l@@ der brothers
Well , technically I &apos;m not exactly a Master@@ Buil@@ der yet .
I may not be a Master Buil@@ der .
I may not have a lot of experience .
fighting or leading or coming up with plans .
Or having ideas in general .
In fact , I &apos;m not all that smart .
And I &apos;m not what you &apos;d call a &quot; creative type . &quot;
generally un@@ skilled .
Also .
sc@@ ared and cow@@ ard@@ ly .
I know what you &apos;re thinking :
in the world to lead us . &quot;
This is supposed to make us feel better ?
No , there was about to be a &quot; but . &quot;
I be leaving this lost cause !
Why are you leaving ?
A house divided against itself would be better
Ab@@ r@@ al@@ am I@@ inc@@ ol@@ n !
You bring your space chair right back here !
Come on , guys !
We can still do this . Right ?
You &apos;re not even a bit special .
Well , you were right about him being a ding@@ -@@ d@@ ong .
You &apos;re a huge dis@@ appointment .
Get him out of here . I don &apos; w@@ anna look at him
I was wrong
Ru@@ h-@@ ro@@ h . It &apos;s the bad guys .
Who@@ a . How did he . ?
Go ! Run ! Come on , everyone ! Protect The Special .
If any@@ body has black parts , I need them , ok@@ ay ?
I only work in black .
And sometimes , very , very dark gray .
Use the yellow bri@@ cks !
H@@ ey , guys , can I help ?
We have got to find that Pi@@ ece .
Let &apos;s get these prisoners back to Lord Business
The Special is no more .
Hello , everybody !
Super@@ man . W@@ onder Woman , I had no idea you &apos;d be here .
Mr. Sh@@ acu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al
Welcome to my Think Tank .
Help us !
I don &apos;t mean to sp@@ oil the party , but does anyone else notice ...
we &apos;re stuck in the middle of the ocean on this couch ?
I mean , it &apos;s not like a big gig@@ an@@ tic ship .
is gon@@ na come out of no@@ where and save us .
My gos@@ h !
Well , it &apos;s kind of hard not to hear when you &apos;re y@@ elling everything .
So why did you come back ?
This be-@@ dou@@ bled land couch .
I wat@@ ched Lord Business &apos; forces completely over@@ look it .
Which means we need more ideas like it !
Oh , thank you .
Mar@@ ry a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
Why , this :
No ! It &apos;s follow the instructions .
Don &apos;t like that . So@@ unds wei@@ rd
Gu@@ ys , you &apos;re all so tal@@ ented and imag@@ in@@ ative .
But you can &apos;t work together as a team .
I &apos;m just a construction worker .
But when I had a plan and we were all working together .
I mean , we could build a sky@@ scra@@ per .
Now , you &apos;re Master@@ Buil@@ ders .
Just imagine what could happen if you did that .
Som@@ ebo@@ dy get me some mark@@ ers ..
some construction paper ...
and some gli@@ tter glu@@ e !
1 call this
put the Fi@@ ece of Resist@@ ance on the Kra@@ gle ..
and save the world . &apos; 
If we can just get in , I know where the air duc@@ ts and wir@@ ing are located .
I can get us anywhere .
How will we get inside ?
In a spac@@ es@@ hip .
Spac@@ es@@ hip ! H@@ a , ha !
Great idea . A B@@ at
No , they &apos;re exp@@ ecting us to show up ...
in a B@@ at-@@ Spac@@ es@@ hip , or a pir@@ ate spac@@ es@@ hip or a rain@@ bow@@ -@@ sp@@ ark@@ le spac@@ es@@ hip .
One of those sounds a@@ wesome to me
that &apos;s exactly like all the other Oc@@ tan delivery spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps .
So not the special spac@@ es@@ hip that I &apos;m building for all of you right now ?
Sorry , B@@ enny . Maybe next time .
O@@ oh , you &apos;re really let@@ ting the oxygen out of my tank here .
Ye@@ ah , but according to your precious instructions .
We don &apos;t have that part .
Maybe we could find one !
What do you think , a spac@@ es@@ hip is just gon@@ na appear out of the blue ?
Are you kid@@ ding me ?
The same thing !
Captain Sol@@ o , we must go .
You know how per@@ tur@@ bed I get if we are not p@@ unc@@ tual .
The Dro@@ id &apos;s right . Let &apos;s roll .
Now hold on , H@@ an .
This might be the right galax@@ y after all
O@@ oh , wh@@ oa , I have a boy@@ friend . And it is super serious . Right , babe ?
Of course it &apos;s serious .
Ye@@ ah !
G@@ ot room for Just one du@@ de ?
Who@@ a ! Bab@@ e !
If he &apos;s a cool du@@ de like you .
You &apos;re trying to ba@@ il on us !
No way .
Bab@@ e ! I knew it ! I knew that .
You really had me there !
Those guys were so l@@ ame . All they did was play space check@@ ers .
Plus , it turns out the ha@@ iry one &apos;s a du@@ de .
And the metal one too . All du@@ des
We pilot the ship to the service entrance ..
so we can get past the dangerous .
but also kind of cool
Space ID .
I have a dri@@ ve-@@ on .
Who are you here to see ?
&apos;m here to see Z@@ our Dut@@ t .
Is that last name &quot; But@@ t , &quot; first name &quot; Your , &quot; or is it . ?
Oh , my gos@@ h !
First try !
Step three : We break into Lord Business &apos; office ...
and we &apos;ll pl@@ under his collection of rel@@ ics for dis@@ gu@@ ises .
Step four :
Motion sensors trig@@ gered in Sec@@ tor 12 .
We &apos;ll never help .
Wh@@ atever you say , b@@ oss
place the thing on the other thing ..
and save the universe .
Who@@ a , Who@@ a , wh@@ oa . H@@ ey , I didn &apos;t draw that . Is that me explo@@ ding ?
U@@ h , I didn &apos;t mention that earlier ?
When you re@@ un@@ ite the Pi@@ ece with the Kra@@ gle , it might explo@@ de ?
No ! But it might not , right ?
S@@ ure , sure , sure . Let &apos;s go with that .
Attention , everybody ! In@@ coming speaker delivery !
Who are you two ?
I see you &apos;ve acci@@ dentally wander@@ ed into my Think Tank .
And by the way , I found a few of your friends .
By which I mean all of them ! Sorry !
Acc@@ ept@@ able work , Bad Co@@ p .
Thank you , si@@ r .
Rob@@ ots , destroy this old man at once .
Did you just call me &quot; old &quot; ?
My sweet E@@ mm@@ et . Come closer .
You must know something about the proph@@ ec@@ y .
I know , I &apos;m doing my best
The proph@@ ec@@ y .
I made it up .
Now you &apos;re talking !
U@@ h .. Ah@@ em . H@@ ey , everybody .
You don &apos;t know me , but I &apos;m on TV , so you can trust me .
I know things seem kind of bad right now .
But there is a way out of this .
This is E@@ mm@@ et .
And he was just like all of you .
A face in the crowd
He was so good at fitting in , no one ever saw him .
And I ow@@ e you an ap@@ ology ...
because I used to look down on people like that .
with no ideas or vision . &quot;
And even though they seemed wei@@ rd
they actually came closer ...
than anyone else to saving the universe .
And now we have to finish what he started
He &apos;s not just a construction worker , D@@ ad . He &apos;s the hero .
N@@ ope , he &apos;s not .
He is a ordinary , regular ..
gen@@ eric construction worker ...
and I need to put him back where he belongs .
H@@ ey , mo@@ m , can we put this stuff somewhere else ?
It &apos;s cl@@ utter@@ ing up my room .
What is it ?
Oh , just some mem@@ ent@@ os of mine .
A few of your dad &apos;s .
Oh , Zim@@ a !
Ye@@ ah .
What &apos;s Zim@@ a ?
Just a party in a bottle .
Man , that remin@@ ds me of some wild times .
It was a very nice car .
Listen , I am done . Stop s@@ no@@ op@@ ing . I &apos;m going .
The seats fol@@ ded all the way back .
Oh , images .

You know , we could have some fun with this .
I &apos;m home !
Hi , mo@@ m .
Mann@@ y , what are you doing sitting in front of a pick@@ le ?
J@@ ay says I can &apos;t leave until I taste it .
Why do you torture him like this ?
Ah ! Sur@@ prise , surprise !

It means we go back to Santa Barbara
Be careful for spi@@ ders .
Sha@@ wn !
Our guy worked from morning till night , right ?
So what &apos;s he doing driving all the way into the hills
An ice cream bar ?
No , no , no , ice bar .
The ones where they give you a par@@ ka
They &apos;re either for tourists or E@@ sk@@ im@@ os .
He could be an E@@ sk@@ im@@ o . What ?

I just don &apos;t want you to make a mistake by going to j@@ ail
May ...
I don &apos;t like this , Sha@@ wn .
We &apos;re the only non-@@ motorcycle in this parking lot
Well , you &apos;ll just have to be extra black , then .
You bet .
These mit@@ tens are aw@@ fully restric@@ tive ,
The fur is f@@ ake , Sha@@ wn .
What we should have done was wa@@ ited to see if
Let &apos;s just get the information we need ,
Hello .
Fair enough . G@@ us , we need to go .
We do , but first , I need to go .
This vo@@ d@@ ka went right through me .
Thank you for your hospitality , O@@ va .
We &apos;ll be back to wear these co@@ ats again ,
We &apos;re not even sure he &apos;s going to recover at all ,
Well , that &apos;s a regional term . G@@ us pre@@ fers &quot; playing football . &quot;
Stim@@ p@@ y . Go@@ ing .
Now , you &apos;re pro@@ ving to be dangerous .
I want you out .
Sha@@ wn , G@@ us , what is going on ?
Dol@@ ores , great . I can explain .
Have you ever seen &quot; Dir@@ ty Rot@@ ten Sco@@ und@@ rels &quot; ?
Oh , we talking , like , you and I ,
What is that ? Why are you doing that ?
H@@ ey , could you do a quick pi@@ v@@ ot
Because I just filled it ,
Ok@@ ay . Ok@@ ay .
I see what &apos;s going on here .
I got news for everybody .
I don &apos;t know how to change a di@@ aper , ok@@ ay ?
I &apos;m not ready for you .
I don &apos;t care what my dad says .
And what does that mean ?
Let &apos;s talk about that . Let &apos;s un@@ pack that .
What it means is that I get why you &apos;re here ,
I.@@ E. might you offer up your te@@ at ?
I absolutely will not .
Now , that would be huge if I wasn &apos;t dre@@ aming .
Mary , let me ask you ... Mary ?
G@@ us , what is this ? Why are we doing this ?
He &apos;s resist@@ ing , Sha@@ wn !
Get off of me ! Are you sure ?
It seems a bit one-@@ si@@ ded .
G@@ us . G@@ us !
No g@@ ills .
So let me get this straight .
You &apos;ve just been pre@@ ten@@ ding this whole time ?
No , not the whole time .
I mean , I still have some num@@ b@@ ness on my right side ,
And you can &apos;t ti@@ ck@@ le for cra@@ p .
Why are you doing this ? Is this an insurance thing ?
And is that a c@@ act@@ us growing out of your head ?
No and no and stop tou@@ ching my sc@@ ar , man .
I got@@ ta wake up . W@@ ake up , G@@ us .
G@@ us . W@@ ake up , come on .
G@@ us , G@@ us , G@@ us !
What ?
We &apos;re not sleeping , du@@ de .
I think baby Mary was a hall@@ uc@@ ination .
I &apos;m pretty sure Wil@@ ker@@ son &apos;s the real deal ,
You suddenly feel like you w@@ anna conf@@ ess something ?
Ye@@ ah .
I used to have a major thing for Je@@ wel ,
I mean , the to@@ oth and the van story ,
Som@@ ehow they &apos;re getting them into the patients &apos; me@@ ds .
I stopped taking mine , but it didn &apos;t help .
Car@@ l@@ ton may have seen a z@@ om@@ bie .
Did you know there are bodies in your fields ?
Oh , gos@@ h , it &apos;s the ice chips .
What ?
Oh , that &apos;s just di@@ abo@@ lical .
They know everything .
That &apos;s how they get you .
H@@ ey , look , if they find out that I &apos;m still lu@@ ci@@ d ,
I have money . I can pay you guys .
But please don &apos;t give me up ,
Sh@@ ame . I just ... I went along with it .
The lying was killing me . I was having pan@@ ic attacks .
And the next thing you know I &apos;m re@@ covering here
And apparently I sp@@ illed everything
And he offers to keep his mouth shut for a price .
A steep price .
There &apos;s one guy standing over there , G@@ us .
How many of those ice chips did you eat ?
I just ate the last one .
You kept eating them after we knew
I can &apos;t help it , Sha@@ wn . I run island hot .
H@@ a ! Dr. Her@@ sch ...
Woo@@ dy !
Well , h@@ ey , guys . How are we doing ?
What are you two still doing here ?
I get to cover the night rounds
Dr. Her@@ sch@@ el &apos;s gone ?
Tell me that isn &apos;t the guy I was supposed to be watching .
You know , not to p@@ ile on the critic@@ is@@ ms , Woo@@ dy ,
G@@ us , I know where the outside man is .
Sha@@ wn , will you get your hand off my kne@@ e ?
G@@ us , for the last time .
Some@@ one from this ice bar
Our highly skilled tracking dog ,
Sha@@ wn , we &apos;ve done this routine before .
Do you not know the definition of ins@@ an@@ ity ?
G@@ us , please , I &apos;m going to leave the le@@ ash on this time .
So ? Mor@@ ris@@ sey , smell this mu@@ ff .
O@@ w . Good news , bad news .
What &apos;s the bad news ?
It was B@@ ard ! He killed the dragon !
I saw it with me own eyes .
He brought the be@@ ast down !
S@@ hot him dead@@ . with a Black Ar@@ row .
Thank you , B@@ ard !
Winter is upon us .
V@@ e must look to our own .
To the sick and the hel@@ pl@@ ess .
Those who can stand , tend to the wounded
We must salv@@ age what we can .
What then ? W@@ ha@@ c &apos; we do then
Hello !
B@@ om b@@ ur ?
Here . P@@ ull your weight .
News of the death of Sm@@ au@@ g will have spread through the lands .
A@@ ye .
Others will now look to the Mountain .
for its wealth
What is it you know ?
Nothing for certain .
It &apos;s what I fear may come .
You saw something out there .
The Or@@ c I pursued out of Lak@@ e-@@ town , I know who he is .
Bol@@ g , sp@@ a@@ wn of A@@ zog the De@@ fil@@ er .
You may tell my father ..
if there is no place for Tau@@ ri@@ el , there is no place for me .
Leg@@ olas .
It is your king &apos;s command .
I ride North . Will you come with me ?
To where ?
He must be hun@@ ted down .
and destroyed once and for all .
Without the Ring of Power ...
Sau@@ ron can never again hold domin@@ ion over Mid@@ d@@ le-@@ earth .
Go now
G@@ anda f
They have no idea what is coming
Z@@ ou must sum@@ mon our friends , bird and be@@ ast .
The battle for the Mountain is about to begin .
It is here in these halls .
I know it .
We have search@@ ed and search@@ ed .
Not well enough .
Thor@@ in , we all would see the stone returned .
And yet , it is still not found !
Do you doubt the loyalty of anyone here ?
I will not see it taken again .
The people of Lak@@ e-@@ town have nothing
They have lost everything
I know well enough their hard@@ ship .
Those who have lived through dragon fire ... should re@@ jo@@ ice .
They have much ... to be grateful for
Br@@ ing more stone to the gate !
That &apos;s it .
Here you go .
Another one
I do not know how to thank you .
Your gr@@ atitude is mis@@ placed .
I did not come on your behalf .
I came to rec@@ la@@ im something of mine .
There are gem@@ s in the Mountain that I , too , desire .
White gem@@ s of pure star@@ light .
The White G@@ ems of Las@@ g@@ alen .
I know an El@@ f Lord who will pay a pretty price for these .
Come on .
Ha@@ il , Thor@@ in , son of Th@@ rain .
We are glad to find you alive beyond hope .
Why do you come to the gates ... of the King under the Mountain armed for war ?
Why does the King under the Mountain f@@ ence himself in .
like a rob@@ ber in his hold ?
Perhaps it is because I am exp@@ ecting to be rob@@ bed .
My lord
but to seek fair settlement .
Will you not speak with me ?
I am listening .
On behalf of the people of Lak@@ e-@@ town ..
.. I ask that you honor your ple@@ dge .
A share of the treasure .
So that they might re@@ build their lives .
I will not treat with any man .
That armed host will attack this Mountain if we do not come to terms
Does it not tell you our cause is just ?
My people offered you help .
And in return , you brought upon them only ru@@ in and death .
When did Lak@@ e-@@ town come to our aid but for the promise of rich reward ?
A bar@@ gain was struck !
A bar@@ gain ?
What choice did we have but to bar@@ ter our birth@@ right
You &apos;re all .
in mort@@ al danger .
What are you talking about ?
You know nothing ... of Wiz@@ ards .
They are i@@ ke winter th@@ under on a wild wind
But sometimes a storm .. is just a storm .
Arm@@ ies of Or@@ cs are on the move
Our enemy has sum@@ mon@@ ed his full strength .
Why show his hand now ?
Because we forced him .
We forced him when the Company of Thor@@ in set out to rec@@ la@@ im their hom@@ eland .
You will for@@ give me if I finish it .
Are the arch@@ ers in position ?
Yes , my lord .
Give the order .
If anything moves on that Mountain ..
The D@@ war@@ ves are out of time .
You , Bow@@ man !
Do you agree ?
Is gold so important to you ?
Would you buy it with the blood of D@@ war@@ ves ?
It won &apos;t come to that .
I came .
to give you ... this .
The Heart of the Mountain .
The King &apos;s Je@@ wel .
And worth a king &apos;s ran@@ som .
How is this ... Y@@ ours to give ?
I took it as my 14th share of the treasure .
Why would you do this ?
You ow@@ e us no loyalty .
I &apos;m not doing it for you .
know that D@@ war@@ ves can be ob@@ st@@ inate
They &apos;re suspicious and secre@@ tive ..
with the worst man@@ ners
Stand down
Not least this faith@@ less Wood@@ land spr@@ ite .
He wishes nothing but ill upon my people .
If he cho@@ oses ... to stand between me and my kin
See if he &apos;s still sm@@ ir@@ king then .
He &apos;s clearly mad , like his c@@ ousin .
Z@@ ou hear that , l@@ ads We &apos;re on !
Let &apos;s give these b@@ ast@@ ards a good ham@@ mer@@ ing !
I &apos;ll get them to safety , si@@ re .
Then my sword is yours to command . Get up !
Look after them
Make for the Great Hall !
Out of my way !
I will not part ..
with a single coin .
He could not see beyond his own desire !
As if I were some low@@ ly D@@ warf Lord
A si@@ ck@@ ness which drove your grand@@ father mad
I am not my grand@@ father . I am not my grand@@ father .
You need@@ n &apos;t worry about that ring . F@@ ell out of my pocket during the battle .
I lost it .
You &apos;re a very fine person , Mr. Bag@@ gins .
And I &apos;m very f@@ ond ... of you .
But you &apos;re only quite a little fellow ..
in a wide world after all
And that &apos;s my dining chair .
So , I don &apos;t really have a job title
4 : 00 , Your Hon@@ or .
Don &apos;t forget to take your medicine .
Well , all these powerful guys .
You can make connections here that &apos;ll last forever .
Not really .
We have a lot of turnover here .
That flag outside has been at half-@@ m@@ ast since April .
That &apos;s why we have these .
Oh . How &apos;s that work ?
Ok@@ ay , u@@ h ...
This one is for all of the law@@ yers in the room
disappear .
Oh , hold on .
Con@@ gres@@ sman Mor@@ ley , enough with the taxes .
You don &apos;t see us making you pay ..
You don &apos;t see us making you pay ...
through the nose .
Ok@@ ay , hold on . No@@ body move , I got this !
Who am I kid@@ ding ? I can &apos;t fall as@@ le@@ ep .
Every car alarm , every whi@@ st@@ le of the wind
It &apos;s all in your imagination .
I just want to Net@@ fli@@ x and M@@ om .
An hour ago , I had made the perfect tub !
Ye@@ ah , thanks again for that , but it didn &apos;t help .
Su@@ gar ! I love sugar !
Ok@@ ay , that is it !
You don &apos;t want to go to sleep !
So much has happened since high school .
I tried to find happiness in the bottom of a bottle .
A sh@@ atter@@ ing depic@@ tion of human suffering .
But enough about how I felt .
I just keep remember@@ ing how V@@ la@@ d and I
For some of Us , that was the last best time .
What time period was all this taking place ?
It didn &apos;t make any sense .
The way things ended with me and V@@ la@@ d ,
A lot of things ha@@ unt me .
It was the night of the pro@@ m .
The roads were very icy .
Through the m@@ ist , I saw the truck &apos;s head@@ lights .
When I came to , the doctor told me we &apos;d been in a hor@@ ri@@ ble
Oh , y@@ O@@ u &apos;ve got to be kid@@ ding me .
Mit@@ ch@@ ell , this is the theater . Have some respect .
All you have to do is sit there and be quiet .
I &apos;ve lived a long life .
Mit@@ ch@@ ell , what are you doing ?
Many friends .
Oh , my beautiful B@@ ess .
Even took a trip to Washington , D.@@ C. ,
Never had any children , of course .
Which is why it was so important that I made it here ton@@ ight .
To see each of you .
You are my children !
Not by anything she says , no .
Ye@@ ah , they never say it .
I gu@@ ess they think
They find little ways to express it .
Being a mo@@ m is like being a model .
You have to learn how to live on cr@@ um@@ bs .
Hi , honey .
Right .
Hon@@ ey , I &apos;m so sorry about the way I was ton@@ ight .
It &apos;s ok@@ ay .
I actually got to go back@@ stage and meet N@@ ancy .
She invited a few of us out for coffee .
Oh , fun .
Ye@@ ah , no , u@@ h , not fun , actually .
All she did was talk about herself .
It really just seemed like she wanted an audience .
And when the check came , you know what she didn &apos;t do ?
Grab it .
Sorry .
Joe &apos;s sleeping in the couch .
Cla@@ ire , we should be focusing on our feelings .
And that no one discovered the body until it reached Ac@@ ap@@ ul@@ co ?
That was , like , more than 2,000 miles away ?
And that they then sent her body back in a Rub@@ ber@@ ma@@ id cool@@ er ..
which then got stuck in Cust@@ oms for , like , a week .
before T@@ ina &apos;s husband could even claim it
Ye@@ ah . I know . I &apos;m the same way .
I mean , I write remin@@ ders about my remin@@ ders .
Right .
H@@ ey , how is your daughter doing ?
She &apos;s almost a senior . It &apos;s hard to believe .
Thanks for asking .
It fu@@ cking hur@@ ts .
Ye@@ ah , you had p@@ ins in your legs for over a year .
It &apos;s gon@@ na hurt .
Your doctor wants me to write an assessment
No , on why there &apos;s been zero improvement in six months .
I have shown up to every fu@@ cking appointment .
well , then maybe you would do better with , u@@ h , someone else .
Ok@@ ay , great .

So I was on break , and I was looking like this .
And all of a sudden , I see a lady climb up on the ledge .
And I &apos;m like , oh , fu@@ ck , she about to jump !

I started y@@ elling at her .
And I was like , &quot; Don &apos;t jump ! Don &apos;t jump ! &quot;
H-@@ How long before she j@@ ump@@ ed ?
It was@@ -@@ It was a pretty long time .
Was it a few minutes before she j@@ ump@@ ed ?
Maybe .
She wasn &apos;t a hundred percent certain .

U@@ h , but@@ . but a law@@ suit
I just came here for N@@ ina &apos;s address .

This is a very good so@@ ap . No buy at home .
Get it . Get it .
Do you have pres@@ crip@@ tions ?

Ok@@ ay , so what do we do ? what do we do ?
we open up Mary here .
Um , that seems really , really tri@@ ck@@ y. what if we get caught ?
You &apos;re a rich white woman . Have you ever been caught at anything ?

I have problems with anything religious .
I think you have bigger problems .

I know . I will call her tomorrow
Boy , nothing gets past you , hu@@ h ?
No , it &apos;s me .
Pro@@ ve it .
You &apos;re gon@@ na have to trust me .
I lied about N@@ ina not leaving a note .
It &apos;s not very original .
Silv@@ ana told me about your accident .
And your little boy .
well , Silv@@ ana needs to keep her fat mouth shut .
She car@@ es about you .
I pay her to care about me .
It &apos;s not my fault she gets sen@@ tim@@ ental .
And don &apos;t you get sen@@ tim@@ ental either .
I can &apos;t save you .
I can bar@@ ely save myself and my k@@ id .
I &apos;m not asking you to .
Silv@@ ama ?
X@@ es ?
Silv@@ ana , you have this hab@@ it ...
of let@@ ting everyone into the house .
But he is a friend , no ?
Once a popular symbol of youth culture ,

J@@ t was Our first date
Tou@@ che , Im@@ el@@ da .
It &apos;s May@@ lia .
But I do like my shoes .
Fo@@ und out he liked Bil@@ ly To@@ el .
Not in an ir@@ onic way .
Oh , I got so dr@@ unk on rum and Co@@ ke .
My par@@ ach@@ ute failed to open ...
and I fell over 10,000 feet to the ground .
Did not . Did too

I &apos;m gon@@ na be an actress .
Ye@@ ah . That &apos;s a sad story .
How old was she ?
Old enough .
Now we &apos;ll have champagne all around .
Thank you .
I was just expla@@ ining the rules .
As a prec@@ au@@ tion , no names .
The two of us have made a good deal of money in the past ,
They know me as a ban@@ ker , slightly b@@ ent ,
Which would be us .
But before they put their money in ,
Only 200@@ ,000 .
50,000 from each of us
G@@ ot a question for you .
Not that I expect a straight answer .
This pro@@ position , just how do@@ d@@ gy is it ?
Well , it &apos;s rather difficult to say
Who are they
And to your point , um .
Br@@ yn .
Oh , dear . The first to break a rule .
But to your point Br@@ yn
Russi@@ ans
Well , if you can &apos;t join us , Br@@ yn ,
I didn &apos;t say that , did I ? M@@ mm ?
Would you like to come and see him ?
U@@ h , no . I wouldn &apos;t want to int@@ ru@@ de .
Sh@@ all we res@@ ume ?
U@@ h , I &apos;ve got something to say .
I &apos;d like to thank everyone for making the effort
We got off on the wrong foot .
And ? Was he glad to see you ?
Po@@ or so@@ d didn &apos;t even know I was there .
Re@@ ally : Another bottle ?
Your grand@@ mother &apos;s thro@@ wing cau@@ tion to the wind .
File
This is your go@@ ing-@@ away dinner .
Well , what I think Vincent means is
That &apos;s right ! One &apos;s interest , one &apos;s assets , family .
M@@ ight I ask what the strategy has been
I don &apos;t think you could call it a strategy
And , of course , I own this house
So , if we include the savings , the fund , and the house ,
Maybe 800 , I think , the last time I looked .
May I call you Bet@@ ty ?
Well , over a 5-@@ year period ,
Is there a risk
Another benefit is that our investments assist
So , your money would be helping those in need .
That &apos;s nice to know , isn &apos;t it ?
Double my money in five years ?
A little more wouldn &apos;t go am@@ iss
Oh , yes , what &apos;s that ?
Well , to limit the administrative costs and your tax liability ,
You mean combine my money with Ro@@ y &apos;s ?
I &apos;m sure you had something similar with your late husband .
Well , yes , but we were married .
That &apos;s like winning the lot@@ tery .
Invest@@ ing with Vincent is like winning the lot@@ tery
So , what would you ...
Stephen ?
I thought you were in Sp@@ and@@ au .
Oh , did you ?
Well , they let me out early
Why didn &apos;t you let me know you were back ?
You should have called
M@@ ind the gap .
Stand clear of the doors , please
The other blo@@ ke was all ,
If the Russi@@ ans were wi@@ red
We committed fraud . Pure and simple
Gre@@ edy old Ro@@ y .
What do you expect me to do ?
Give me back my 100,000 qu@@ id .
I don &apos;t have it .
You speak German ?
Sorry ?
I wasn &apos;t really listening .
Will you say that again ?
When they burn books , in the end ,
I didn &apos;t expect there &apos;d be quite so many ballo@@ ons .
L@@ ooks like Disney runs it .
Still , prefer@@ able to being shot at .
Well , I wouldn &apos;t mind shooting a few .
I think someone &apos;s getting c@@ rank@@ y
Would you mind taking him ?
I think I &apos;m gon@@ na go exploring
Well , the doctor can bu@@ g@@ ger off .
Do you know how many people were shot
No , Stephen . I don &apos;t .

Well , yes , the bar@@ ber down at the regim@@ ent is just aw@@ ful ,
And I ain &apos;t gon@@ na let that happen .
Now , will our old friend from Tom@@ bst@@ one be joining us ?

But we have a new player , a weal@@ thy Mexican coffee bean ran@@ cher .
Am I t@@ ard@@ y-@@ o ?
S@@ ne@@ ak@@ y little Mexican .
May I present Don Don Diego .
We run a gent@@ lem@@ an &apos;s game here , Mr. Diego .
Your , u@@ h , two bo@@ dy@@ guards are completely unnecessary .
That is some mysti@@ cal sh@@ it .
I wish to move the dres@@ ser in my bedroom closer to the window ,
I &apos;d love to help , ma &apos;@@ am , but I really should keep playing the piano .
No one will even know you &apos;re gone .
Gent@@ lemen , c@@ ough up your buy
All right !
Make it rain like T@@ wa@@ in .
Take that and that .
Ye@@ ah !
You know , I make that same face when I put my c@@ olog@@ ne on in the morning ,
You know what I think ?
I think Don Don Diego isn &apos;t really a coffee bean ran@@ cher at all .
And his true purpose here is to ro@@ b us .
Don &apos;t make me kill you , Mr. Ear@@ p . H@@ ands up high .
Oh , sn@@ ap ! You got the drop on Wy@@ att Ear@@ p ?
Pro@@ ud to know you , Bur@@ ro .
He &apos;s proud .
You must be , u@@ h , Saint Louis , right ?
Ch@@ ico .
Boy , you got your mo@@ m &apos;s muscles .
Now and then , you know .
We should play together some@@ time .
I &apos;d like that , D@@ ad .
I &apos;d like that a lot .
Ye@@ ah , son , we &apos;ll do that .
You must be Del@@ il@@ ah &apos;s boy .
Boy , she made some fine , fine whis@@ key .
O@@ oh , y@@ e@@ ah .
She must &apos;ve been really h@@ itting it hard when she was pregnant with you .
So that business can wait up north , can &apos;t it ... best man ?
Well , now that you mention it , maybe I should change my plans .
Buen@@ o . Buen@@ o .
Ye@@ ah .
H@@ ey ! What are they doing back ?
What is this ?
I gu@@ ess it &apos;s time you kids
I &apos;m just too famous .
I can &apos;t walk into any town west of the Rock@@ ies
So , I came up with a way we could make 50 grand
Answer me something .
W@@ ere you ever great at anything in your life besides ste@@ aling ?
No . No .
You ap@@ ples didn &apos;t fall far from this tree .
Don &apos;t deny who you are .
If you knew who we really were ,
Don &apos;t over@@ play your hand , son .
I &apos;m still holding an ace .
I found her . I .. I told you I &apos;d find her .
This little beauty st@@ um@@ bled into our camp a few days ago .
She actually tried to rescue me .
I &apos;m gu@@ essing this means you don &apos;t want me to be your best man no more , hu@@ h ?
Well , I &apos;m gon@@ na make this real simple for you .

There &apos;s also a min@@ or@@ ity-@@ owned category .
You don &apos;t know who your father is ,
Any chance he could be native amer@@ ican ?
Yes , in fact , I think his name was
Wa@@ it .
Maybe we don &apos;t even need your father .
We are white ,
So now all we need is a letter of recommendation
I was thinking of a recommendation
I &apos;ve already written it , so he just has to sign it .
Will you ask Andy ? I can &apos;t , he &apos;s my ex .
And I &apos;m saving up my favor
I hate asking men for things .
Fav@@ ors , last names , to stop .

Man , you mess@@ ed that up .
So self-@@ involved .
Com@@ ing in a little hot , Am@@ ir .

He left last night without a pe@@ ep .
Dam@@ n it , now I &apos;m thinking about those Pe@@ eps again .

I have two pairs .
Ok@@ ay , fine . Give it back .

I &apos;m not so sure S@@ ophie &apos;s cleaning business
I mean , when we worked for her ,
Her organ@@ -@@ trading might not be .

We might de@@ port you ourselves .
All we need is a Fe@@ dex box .
Um , Carol@@ ine . Come over here .
I think I can help you with that .
The size of my business has never been in question .
And I may not have a business ,
H@@ an Lee does .

Oh , M.@@ J. and I are building this so@@ ap@@ box th@@ ing@@ y car
You should get Tom to help .
He did it with all our boys .
It &apos;s how they learned to swe@@ ar .
Oh . That &apos;s ok@@ ay . I &apos;ll figure it out .
I do . Since Tom and I split ,
No . I can do this . I have to .
And you know what ? I think it &apos;s gon@@ na turn out great .
Do you always move your lips when you read ?
Do you always comment on everything
I haven &apos;t said a word about your tie .
Ok@@ ay , we &apos;re here for discovery compliance , and trial setting .
Ms. Stone , Mr. West@@ on , you &apos;ve ex@@ changed witness lists ?
The most beautifully embro@@ i@@ dered chin@@ ese sil@@ k ,
Ok@@ ay , a little in@@ sensitive . My bad .
No , I-@@ I &apos;ve had a change of heart ,
In fact , I need to return these .
What ? You can &apos;t . I work on commission .
Did you know that one of these scar@@ ves
No , but that sounds aw@@ fully familiar .
It was in the p@@ amp@@ h@@ let that Carlos sli@@ pped me last night .
He did what now ?
And we talked on the phone this morning ,
He &apos;s a very special guy .
H@@ old on to him .
Look , where Dor@@ is puts her money is her decision .
Tom@@ orrow morning , 9 : 00 , she &apos;s putting it here .
Ok@@ ay . You don &apos;t have to be so s@@ mu@@ g
No quot@@ ation marks . I &apos;m actually doing charity ,
And I &apos;m helping people put their war@@ dro@@ bes together .
I got to run to a meeting .
Now ? We &apos;re in the middle of an argument .
Ye@@ ah , but it &apos;s no fun to argue when only one side
But you know what it is fun ?
A little victory dance .
Ok@@ ay , it took me all night ,
but ... it &apos;s ... finished .
Ok@@ ay . Before you say anything ,
but personally , I like them . I think they &apos;re a@@ wesome .
And there &apos;s a basket on the back for s@@ und@@ ries or snacks
But why would you need to che@@ at with a car like this , right ?
No , no , it &apos;s perfect .
Oh , I &apos;m so relie@@ ved .
You w@@ anna take it for a spin ?
Ye@@ ah , but .... . I &apos;m kind of thir@@ sty .
Can you get me something to drink ?
Of course . Two fro@@ sty non-@@ c@@ aff@@ ein@@ ated root be@@ ers
Oh , my god ! What did you do ?
I didn &apos;t see it coming . I &apos;m so sorry .
No , not you ! My son ! You can go .
They don &apos;t have to . They &apos;re always star@@ ing at me
Oh , honey .
And if I go to the Fa@@ ther@@ -S@@ on Der@@ by .
and I &apos;m the only k@@ id with his mo@@ m ,
I &apos;m so sorry . I had no idea .
What can I do to make it better ?
Nothing . I just want dad .
How was so@@ cc@@ er ?
A@@ wesome . I think we &apos;re gon@@ na
Nice . You want me to make you something to eat ?
Thanks . I &apos;m gon@@ na get changed .
It &apos;s cute how her generation thinks that sport is interesting .
Oh , and , um , I will bring her to the game Saturday .
L@@ ooks like we won &apos;t need to switch week@@ ends .
I thought you and Jane were going away .
Can &apos;t . I got to work .
Greg@@ g wants me to re@@ work the strategic plan
Hu@@ h . Well , that su@@ cks .
Never liked that guy .
I mean , he said you guys had drinks the other night ?
It was nothing . We just , you know ...
hung out for a bit .
You do realize that that could be aw@@ k@@ ward for me .
Hu@@ h . That &apos;s wei@@ rd .
What ?
I have an &quot; Is@@ n &apos;t That Ir@@ onic &quot; app
I &apos;m serious , Lyn@@ ette . That &apos;s where I work .
It was just drinks with a guy I know ,
I promise not to do anything embar@@ rass@@ ing
Ok@@ ay . You know what ? You w@@ anna see Greg@@ g ?
It &apos;s fine with me .
How about if instead of eating this sand@@ wich ,
H@@ ey . How about ... &quot; No &quot; ?
But what if I told you something about dad and Jane
Then could 1 ?
How do I know your information is even worth
Oh , it is .
Oh . It would be wrong to teach you that this kind of black@@ mail works .
Besides , I can see
When dad told Jane he had to work this weekend ,
Re@@ ally ? The chocolate that I am in no way trading
She was all , &quot; We never have time together &quot;
The en@@ vel@@ ope is still sitting on a sh@@ elf in the kitchen .
Put the sand@@ wich down ,
Well , look who st@@ rolled in from the out@@ back .
Sp@@ ous@@ al privil@@ ege .
Which is ?
It &apos;s a crazy law we have here .
You don &apos;t have to testi@@ fy against your husband .
So here &apos;s what &apos;s gon@@ na happen .
We say &quot; I do , &quot; we walk back up the a@@ is@@ le ,
And if I don &apos;t ?
Well , then I gu@@ ess you won &apos;t be seeing
And trust me ...
my secret is way better than yours .
So you are alive .
You &apos;re just not ans@@ wering your phone .
I &apos;m sorry . I just ...
can &apos;t imagine what you must think of me
B@@ ree , listen , I don &apos;t judge people .
I defend them .
Well , I &apos;m not going to prison .
I mean , Trip says we &apos;re gon@@ na win ,
I just thank god that even after all of this ,
Ok@@ ay , I &apos;m gon@@ na say it .
B@@ ree , you have a cr@@ ush on your lawyer .
I gu@@ ess you &apos;re right .
You &apos;re on trial for murder , B@@ ree .
You got to keep a clear head .
And so does he .
Dor@@ is , I just want you to know how grateful we are .
Your donation is gon@@ na help so many re@@ covering ad@@ dic@@ ts
Oh , stop . I should be th@@ an@@ king you
And please for@@ give the appearance of my office .
Every p@@ enny that we get goes directly to those in need ,
nice ... things .
Those in need , hu@@ h ?
This is not my stuff !
And not just about car stuff , you know ?
Any@@ time you need something , give US a call .
So what do you think of this design ? H@@ ey ?
It .... kind of looks like a Cor@@ v@@ ette .
Kind of ? It &apos;s an exact ren@@ dering .
Look at the sh@@ ading on the wheel well .
Cal@@ m down . You trac@@ ed it out of a magazine .
Can you guys really build this ?
Um , well ... not without your help .
I know what you &apos;re doing .
You don &apos;t want me going on this research trip
I &apos;m not afraid to be alone .
On land .
On the sea , it would be terri@@ fying .
Because of all the dro@@ w@@ ning .
Shel@@ don .
Fine , no more dro@@ w@@ ning talk .
I &apos;ll change the subject .
Will you be there ?
Of course .
Well , that &apos;s two . Three if you count me .
Oh , this is getting out of hand .
So , then , during my afternoon shift ,
Oh , that &apos;s aw@@ ful .
Not really . My shirt was so@@ aking wet .
I got , like , the biggest tip of my life . Oh .
So , listen , do you remember when I said
of general rel@@ ativity and hydro@@ dynamics suggest
I thought I said that to you .
Any@@ way ,
Wo@@ w , Haw@@ king ! Good for you !
Well , it is .
Ar@@ en &apos;t they afraid Haw@@ king will just roll over@@ board ?
U@@ h , he &apos;s not gon@@ na be there .
He &apos;s just sending a team to research his theory .
Oh , sure .
Like when you send me to kill spi@@ ders in your bathtub .
Ok@@ ay . Four months .
Ye@@ ah .
And I &apos;m a little wor@@ ried
Oh , swe@@ e@@ tie , if you &apos;re gon@@ na screw things up ,
Re@@ ally , you guys do not need to throw me a go@@ ing-@@ away party .
Are you kid@@ ding me ?

Hello , Ra@@ i@@ esh .
Hello , A@@ my . Nice to see you .
What can I say ? It &apos;s fun@@ nier with the acc@@ ent .
There &apos;s beer in the fridge .
Any@@ way , you guys really don &apos;t need to make a big deal .
Leon@@ ard , you &apos;re being sel@@ fish .
We need to give you a proper sen@@ d-@@ off so we &apos;ll have closure
Shel@@ don , swe@@ e@@ tie , shut up .
You know , one of the things
Ok@@ ay .
I have a request to make .
And now he can talk .
I want to cut open your brain
The only person allowed inside this head is Dr. Phi@@ l .
I think I &apos;m a little more qualified than you
Don &apos;t call her my girlfriend .
We haven &apos;t discussed whether or not
Now that it &apos;s out there ..
.... are you my girlfriend ?
By the way , if you say no ,
She &apos;ll be here .
Just give it a rest , ok@@ ay ?
Um , can I have your attention , everyone ?
That &apos;s , u@@ h , B-@@ flat , for those who don &apos;t have perfect pitch .
I would like to propose a to@@ ast
He has been presented with a wonderful opportunity ,
That must &apos;ve been very hard for you to say .
Well , I mean it .
I &apos;m really happy for you .
And that &apos;s how you get a t@@ ooth@@ paste commercial . Che@@ ers .
Che@@ ers .
It was really nice of you to try to be happy for Leon@@ ard .
Here &apos;s what we &apos;re prepared to offer .
You &apos;re jo@@ king , right ?
I don &apos;t jo@@ ke about real estate .
I jo@@ ke about golf and Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
It &apos;s ok@@ ay , though . I &apos;m married to one .
How can I turn down a free meal ?
First time &apos;s the hard@@ est .
What do you say , my love ?
Well , I &apos;m not sure I &apos;m ready to say goo@@ d-@@ b@@ ye to this guy yet .
But I &apos;ll only stay if you let me contribute .
I did bring along a f@@ abul@@ ous bottle of &apos; 82 bor@@ deaux
For that , you can take Mann@@ y home .

And then I &apos;m gon@@ na lay you down by the fire ...
Oh . S@@ low at first , then ...
If you guys are talking about the house ,
He &apos;s not 14
And why wouldn &apos;t he ? She &apos;s so much sm@@ ar@@ ter than me .
She knows so much more about the things that he loves .
They have their little inside j@@ ok@@ es .
If she lear@@ ns how to fro@@ th his c@@ app@@ u@@ cc@@ ino ,
You and Mann@@ y have the closest relationship I &apos;ve ever seen .
Hell , he may never form
You &apos;re just saying that .
And it doesn &apos;t matter if Mann@@ y likes her .
Know@@ ing Javier &apos;s track record ,
You are wrong , J@@ ay . I &apos;m not going to d@@ ump her .
In fact , this weekend , I asked T@@ ris@@ h to mar@@ ry me .
You &apos;re going to mar@@ ry her ?
I was waiting for the right time to tell you .
N@@ ailed it .
I really want T@@ ris@@ h to wear it .
She is the most amazing woman I &apos;ve ever known .
You see that I am holding a knife .
Please .
Hal@@ f our marriage was you with a knife .
T@@ ris@@ h is the one . And Mann@@ y already loves her .
Fine . I &apos;ll go get you the ring .
But you ow@@ e me $ 8
And I like T@@ ris@@ h , too .
Me , too .
Well , then I supp@@ ose this is

Oh , my gos@@ h . This is the best news ever !
Here . Drink .
Now listen , my love .
I can &apos;t do this .
No , no . I &apos;ll just push a little harder .
Javier , stop . It &apos;ll never work .
But wait , my love .
We can put butter on your finger .
That &apos;s him . H@@ it it .
H@@ ey ! Not him .
H@@ ey , guys . Sorry it took me so long .
I &apos;ve never bought beer before . There &apos;s just so many choices .
Do we really need that much ?
I don &apos;t know . Is this a lot ?
Show@@ time !
H@@ ey ! Not him .
H@@ ey ! Th@@ ought I &apos;d just swing by and see how it &apos;s going .
Z@@ ack here ?
Oh , my God .

Alex was right . You are into him .

I mean , it will cost a fort@@ une .
Rel@@ ax , I &apos;m loaded , I scored 20 big ones last Sunday .
Not another cra@@ p g@@ ame@@ No , stu@@ d poker this time .
S@@ itting there with 3 tens , and some guy with aces up keeps raising me .
How did you get all the money to play in such a big poker game ?
My horse came in this weekend .
I &apos;m telling you this is why I have to go to Vegas .
I &apos;m a gam@@ bler and I don &apos;t know how else to put it .
I &apos;ve always wanted you to have to show me around Manhattan .
This is going to be absolutely fantastic .
Hi , I &apos;m here for Mr. Roland P@@ oll@@ ard .
Roland , this is Ash@@ lei@@ gh En@@ right from Y@@ ard@@ ley .
How do you do ? Ash@@ lei@@ gh , this is Roland .
The scre@@ ening is all set up . We are running on a really tight schedule .
First of all , I &apos;d just like to say that what an honor this is for me .
I just want to say you &apos;re by far the most interesting amer@@ ican director .
Thank you .
I write in the arts for a paper
I &apos;m surprised to hear that someone your age is
Film is my total thing . I &apos;ve seen all the amer@@ ican classi@@ cs .
Partic@@ ularly the euro@@ pe@@ ans . Ku@@ ro@@ sa@@ wa is my favourite .
Techn@@ ically , he is not euro@@ pe@@ an , technically , he &apos;s , obviously , japanese .
But you really speak to my soul .
What college are you from ?
Y@@ ard@@ ley . It &apos;s small .
I know it well , my first wife went there .
Re@@ ally , Yes .
Very sexy . A philosophy major .
To tell you the truth I didn &apos;t des@@ erve her , and
Well , that &apos;s a ...
N@@ either hi@@ ther nor yon .
I imagine .
I gu@@ ess , it &apos;s probably more yon that hi@@ ther .
Are you from New York ?
Tu@@ c@@ son , Arizona .
What does your family do ?
I was afraid you &apos;d ask .
My father owns banks .
Is that bad ?
I know what you are thinking .
&quot; Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , the one percent . &quot; But we are not .
We &apos;re just , totally Epis@@ cop@@ ali@@ ans , who happen to just be rich .
That &apos;s how my Ash@@ ley was .
Who &apos;s your Ash@@ ley ?
My first wife .
The scre@@ ening has some last minute changes .
Face saving changes .
How long does it run ?
I gu@@ ess I could shift my lunch plans .
One thing about New York City : you are here or you are no@@ where .
You cannot achieve this level of an@@ xi@@ ety , hos@@ tility and par@@ ano@@ ia anywhere else .
It &apos;s really ex@@ hil@@ ar@@ ating .
Any@@ how , I decided to treat myself to a c@@ igar@@ ette holder ,
I smoke too much .
So then who do I meet , but one of the most ob@@ no@@ x@@ ious
Well@@ es H@@ ey .
Tro@@ l@@ ler .
I heard that you flan@@ ked out of fresh@@ man year .
He got thrown out of Princ@@ eton for passing bed checks .
No , I didn &apos;t hear about that . The big deal .
Because of his father he &apos;s got like the all-@@ time golden par@@ ach@@ ute .
He could commit mass murder and he &apos;d still have a c@@ ush@@ y job waiting for him .
It &apos;s a wei@@ rd way to put it . And Mill@@ stein is mar@@ rying Car@@ ol Dur@@ and .
Which , I &apos;ll never understand , because she res@@ em@@ bles Y@@ asser Ara@@ fat .
Not to mention she &apos;s an Ice Queen .
You can &apos;t believe everything .
What are you doing in town ?
It &apos;s my girlfriend , I &apos;m just showing her around for the weekend .
A@@ my is at V@@ ass@@ ar . Big deal . I &apos;m impressed .

A@@ my was beautiful . Ye@@ ah , if you like Grace Kelly .
What are you in town for ?
My girlfriend , she has an interview with Roland P@@ oll@@ ard for the school paper .
Who &apos;s that ?
It &apos;s a director . He did &quot; Winter Mem@@ ories , &quot; &quot; Mo@@ on@@ light . &quot;
Oh y@@ e@@ ah ! I can &apos;t stand his fli@@ cks .
You should go and watch them shoot . You could be in it .
They &apos;re looking for volunteers .
With that c@@ igar@@ ette holder you could be the perfect milk to@@ ast ner@@ d .
I &apos;m running a little bit late .
I wouldn &apos;t trust my girl with a big time Hollywood director .
Good to know .
You didn &apos;t ask me what I am doing . What are you doing ?
I &apos;m only pre-@@ med .
We have pa@@ w at the boarding of Gren@@ ada .
I can &apos;t make lunch .
What ? Why not ?
I have to see his film . You do ?
It &apos;s an un@@ belie@@ vable opportunity .
And then we &apos;re going to discuss it after and everything .
Thank you . Ne@@ ver@@ mind .
Just k@@ iss me so I can really feel it in my to@@ es .
I used to k@@ iss your older sister , did she ever say anything about that or no ?
I don &apos;t know , I don &apos;t rec@@ all . I think maybe she said you were a 4 .
A 4 , She said I was a 4 , I don &apos;t know , maybe a 6 .
Maybe a 6 , I can &apos;t rec@@ all . Just this k@@ iss , I want it to be hot .
If we are going to do it , let &apos;s do it right .
Good work eth@@ ic . Thank you .

It &apos;s a process , we do this every time . T@@ ed , T@@ ed .
Rol@@ lie , come on , back . Don &apos;t drink .
Oh , God .
It &apos;s a bar and the piano for ton@@ ight .
He &apos;s not at the hotel and he didn &apos;t show up for the press interview , so
I thought the film was full of wonderful things .
Me too . Tell him , you ... Tell him , tell Roland .
Because hearing that from me won &apos;t mean anything .
I &apos;m always at this end of the argument , but you are fresh ,
Especially a pretty one , maybe ... You may ...
Come on , let &apos;s find him . Are you ok@@ ay ?
Ye@@ ah . Come on .
No , she &apos;s not g@@ ay , she &apos;s charming and beautiful .
And we were supposed to have this ...
Go@@ d@@ dam@@ n weekend in the city together , and suddenly she &apos;s ...
Park@@ ed down with all these interviews for the school paper .
She &apos;s ambitious , you should find that admir@@ able .
One , it was supposed to be one little ... One tiny little , l@@ ous@@ y , hour inter@@ ve@@ w .
Instead , you know . Lost the whole , go@@ d@@ dam@@ n , weekend .
Would you just relax ?
I don &apos;t really know why ? I &apos;m having a hard time relaxing , Ch@@ an .
Because this was going to be a special weekend .
Instead I &apos;m out here in a ...
Wander@@ ing streets , like Hag@@ ar in a go@@ d@@ dam@@ n desert or something .
Don &apos;t tell me , tell her . Tell her to get her priorities straight .
You want to drink some wine , walk in the rain and give her bron@@ chi@@ tis .
Ok@@ ay , look she &apos;s , apparently , onto a very big story .
She takes her job very seriously , al@@ right ?
Fine , then get over it .
I &apos;m in the process of getting over it .
Un@@ less you are wor@@ ried som@@ ebo@@ dy &apos;s h@@ itting on her .
Is she inter@@ viewing attractive men ?
I &apos;ve never really thought about it . I don &apos;t know .
Some might say they are interesting .
Then maybe you better step in and asser@@ t yourself .
Do you think I have to be more demanding , I would .
These are like movie big shots she &apos;s hanging out with .
Su@@ its , Yes , a director and a screen@@ writer .
Artists , they are usually pas@@ sionate .
Oh , Jesus Christ !
Ok@@ ay , you &apos;re right , I have to call her now .
The so@@ oner the better .
You think there &apos;s that much of a r@@ ush , I don &apos;t know .
Oh , Christ , al@@ right .
It &apos;s your idea .
What do you think I should say ?
There &apos;s nothing you can say . What do you mean ?
Without so@@ unding pos@@ ses@@ sive .
Christ , Ch@@ an , you just encouraged me to call her .
Now I &apos;m asking for your help
I can &apos;t talk to you right now . I &apos;m kind of involved in the situation .
We have a number of things planned for today .
I &apos;m very busy right now .
But , I really , I can &apos;t explain it over the phone .
Ash@@ lei@@ gh , we were talking about one movie interview .
What could possible be so secre@@ tive about that ?
What &apos;s so CIA ?
Un@@ less there &apos;s some funny business going on ?
I &apos;ll talk to you later . B@@ ye , G@@ ats@@ by .
Oh , these , go@@ d@@ dam@@ n , cell@@ phones are ...
I don &apos;t know , to me it sounds du@@ bi@@ ous to the max .
It sounds du@@ bi@@ ous to you because you have sin@@ ister mind .
You must really love her . I do , she &apos;s a breath of fresh air .
She &apos;s charming and del@@ ight@@ ful . She &apos;s pretty .
She &apos;s sexy and somehow at the same she &apos;s wit@@ ty .
She s@@ ings very nic@@ ely . She plays the flu@@ te .
I don &apos;t know how to break this to you .
But I &apos;m sick of hearing about her , ok@@ ay ?
Was that your boy@@ friend ?
G@@ ats@@ by . Ye@@ ah .
What &apos;s G@@ ats@@ by do ?
He goes to Y@@ ard@@ ley too .
Which he refers to as &quot; For@@ ced law on University . &quot;
He &apos;s not really focused profession@@ ally .
I think that in his wil@@ dest dreams he &apos;d like to be Sky Master@@ son .
A Broadway book@@ ie@@ He &apos;s a little ec@@ cent@@ ric .
I think it has to do with the fact that he and his mo@@ m never really hit it off .
She was always forcing him to read everything , and learn piano ...
He is really smart .
He was one of those students who ...
He doesn &apos;t have to study for a test and then he just aces it .
So@@ unds like me .
To tell you the truth .
Don &apos;t tell any@@ body , but I think he has a touch of A@@ sper@@ ger &apos;s .
I &apos;m going to get out of here too .
What are you doing now ? Why ?
Why , because I have a little bit of time to kill .
And I thought about going to Modern Museum .
Look at the We@@ e@@ Ge@@ e exhibit .
Oh , I see . You have nothing better to do so you want me to keep you company ?
You know what , For@@ get it . I dated your older sister .
You &apos;ve always had a little bit of an attitude , ok@@ ay ?
I &apos;m not looking for any trouble .
I have to check out some paintings at the M@@ at &apos;s Pro@@ fession Class .
If you want to keep me company .
I don &apos;t know why you couldn &apos;t have just ...
Fine , it &apos;s going to be fun .
Al@@ right , let me change , I &apos;m so@@ aked . Are you hung@@ ry ?
I &apos;d give you an Arizona lunch , but we are all out of be@@ ef j@@ erk@@ y .
Br@@ ings back a lot of memories .
My fol@@ ks are in East H@@ ampton for the weekend .
How come you didn &apos;t go ?
I &apos;ve got a date ton@@ ight .
You ?
Who &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate victim ?
You wouldn &apos;t know him , he &apos;s a girlfriend &apos;s der@@ mat@@ ologist .
It &apos;s romantic .
Don &apos;t forget to show him those three ir@@ regular black mol@@ es on your back .
I &apos;m sure they &apos;re nothing .
I really hope I won &apos;t regre@@ t not going to the Hamilton &apos;s .
The beach is so pretty in the rain too .
I know ! I know ! Under the clock .
Which clock ?
The Del@@ ac@@ orte clock , where all the animals go around in Central Park .
I love it , it &apos;s very old movie .
My M@@ om and I used to watch old movies together all the time .
In my version he &apos;s waiting , the music plays .
And she never comes .
Or she &apos;s waiting and he cho@@ oses the other woman .
Can &apos;t they just k@@ iss in the rain ?
That sounds pretty good to me , even if it is commercial .
Picture yourself . Ok@@ ay .
It &apos;s four minutes to six .
You &apos;re pac@@ ing up and down , rain drops have just started to fall .
You &apos;re at your Del@@ ac@@ orte clock in Central Park .
Exp@@ ecting your ...
Der@@ mat@@ ologist .
But he just diagnos@@ ed a car@@ cin@@ oma in his own lim@@ p .
Would you give me a break , In my version , everything &apos;s fine .
He meets me , holds me , k@@ is@@ ses me .
It &apos;s lovely . No@@ body needs a bi@@ op@@ sy .
Con@@ nie !
Con@@ nie ! T@@ ed .
Is this how you are shopping with Ju@@ dy in Connec@@ tic@@ ut ?
What are you doing here ?
I happen to see you out the window , from the car .
By she@@ er chance .
She &apos;s a journalist .
I &apos;m 21 . She &apos;s 21 .
She &apos;s 21 , She &apos;s a journalist .
I have a proof of age , actually . No , you don &apos;t need this .
This always happens in bars .
I would like to make a press release about my husband .
Re@@ ally , Can I write this down ?
S@@ ure , go ahead . Ash@@ lei@@ gh , please .
Ask him how many times he has been un@@ faithful to me ?
She &apos;s dem@@ ented . You &apos;re dem@@ ented .
W@@ ere all these women for a pleasure or for some project ?
Stop filling her head with lies . Ash@@ lei@@ gh , come here .
Take this address to the studio , ok@@ ay , Find Rol@@ lie , come on .
Find Rol@@ lie . I don &apos;t know my way around New York .
It &apos;s ok@@ ay , tell the c@@ ab driver ...
I did take her to her first cra@@ p game .
I know and I loved that . I loved hearing every detail .
I was hop@@ ing she would get serious with you ,
I thought you were a special idi@@ ot .
I &apos;m glad I impressed you , Ch@@ an .
I remember A@@ my came home and she told me that you took her to
She told you about that , Every mo@@ ist detail .
Now I embar@@ rass@@ ed .
Don &apos;t be , that night she gave you a 6 .
With a ast@@ eri@@ x .
She said you were a little ten@@ se .
Ye@@ ah , Central Park can be a little dangerous at 2 AM .
But very romantic . Ok@@ ay .
And then it started to rain .
That was the best part .
Her hair got wet , her clothes started to cling to her body .
She started s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing . I don &apos;t really remember that part .
Now that I think of it , Ch@@ an .
You always were around , giving me the fish eye .
You are just realis@@ ing this now ?
That &apos;s all you have to say ?
You didn &apos;t think I was cute or attractive , anything ?
You seemed fine .
You mean I had no physical de@@ form@@ ities .
You know what , Ch@@ an , I wasn &apos;t really paying attention ,
A@@ my would make her entrance , like a , go@@ d@@ dam@@ n , Miss America .
I &apos;m sure Ash@@ lei@@ gh is a beauty queen type .
She is , she was an actual first-@@ place winner at her high school in Tus@@ con .
4@@ H , right ?
Yes , how did you gu@@ ess ?
In@@ k it in . Let &apos;s get out of here .
How can you say that when you &apos;re in the papers every week
Get in , get in . Where are we going ?
Not now guys , not now .
Come on , give us a break ! Come on ! No !
Should I be in here ?
Make yourself at home .
Would you like to sit down , No , no , no .
Would you like a drink , No thanks .
Would you like to have dinner with me ?
Would I like to have what with you ?
I have no plans , but to get an early b@@ ite and then .
You and I can go to a party together .
Party , Dinner ?
What about Ti@@ ff@@ any Griff@@ in@@ l though ...
No , we just broke up .
I &apos;m going to change into my street clothes .
While you think about it , ok@@ ay ?
Oh , G@@ os@@ h .
Great , now I have to take Ash@@ lei@@ gh to my M@@ om &apos;s , go@@ d@@ dam@@ n , party .
Why is that so bad ?
Why is that so bad , Ch@@ an , Because I wanted to spend the night
These things have no meaning to me .
I noticed you haven &apos;t ren@@ ounced your family &apos;s money .
What does that mean ?
That means you could move out .
Get a job , put yourself through college .
Oh y@@ e@@ ah , as of what ?
Piano player in the dive .
Or , maybe a poker player , D@@ ice h@@ ust@@ ler ?
You &apos;re bad , Ch@@ an . You are going straight to hell .
There is something romantic about gam@@ bl@@ ers .
And old songs . Meeting under the clock .
Ye@@ ah , maybe in movies , but this is real life .
Real life is fine for people who can &apos;t do any better .
Who ? Your skin doctor .
At least he knows enough not to wind up in the eg@@ yp@@ tian tom@@ b .
Veg@@ a ! Francisco !
Thanks for being here . It is always like this ?
This is nothing .
I &apos;m just signing one . Thank you , thank you for being here .

Maybe she &apos;s in some kind of trouble .
Ra@@ ise , two thousand .

Maybe she was kid@@ n@@ apped or mur@@ dered .
Should I call the police ?
Of course , it would be so embar@@ rass@@ ing if she turn up alive .

We got in a sort of a crazy conversation .
For the first time in my life she surprised me in a good way .
Now I feel closer to her .
M@@ ust have been a big talk . What did you discuss ?
The oldest profession .
Journ@@ alism ?
That &apos;s the second oldest .
H@@ old up . You know the names of your teeth ?
Don &apos;t you ?
I don &apos;t even know the name of my father .

You just made it into O@@ leg &apos;s sp@@ ank bank .

My teeth don &apos;t know where to go .
Well , maybe they should just back@@ pack for a couple of years ,
Listen , perfect teeth ,

Ch@@ est@@ nut and I were just about to pick out

So all this is just a dist@@ rac@@ tion
They had to know the tape would be discre@@ di@@ ted .
They had to know that we &apos;d talk to the c@@ amer@@ am@@ an .
Much bl@@ ame has been placed on another innocent person ,
S@@ ara , if you &apos;re listening ,
I took advantage of you ,
.... of your commitment to help others
I &apos;ve considered many ways to ap@@ ologi@@ ze ,
There &apos;s more of the same here .
U@@ h , body language , his tells ..
If you ask me , it doesn &apos;t look like he means this at all .
I don &apos;t care what it looks li@@ ke@@ .@@ Play it again .

I did say th@@ at@@ .@@ Would you say that ?
I wish I could do this differently .

People mur@@ dered by government oper@@ atives ...
This isn &apos;t about Terr@@ ence Ste@@ ad@@ man ,
What do you mean ? They &apos;re not going after the president ;
your sense of hum@@ or is 82 ,
But , you know , we wouldn &apos;t mind seeing those numbers
So , I &apos;m going to get some writing samples from
Great .
I am really interested in knowing how people feel
Ye@@ ah .
Right . You know , so we don &apos;t
And that &apos;s only because people don &apos;t seem to care .
That &apos;s interesting .
With that said , if you could bro@@ ker some deal
Well , that &apos;s perfect .
I mean , we &apos;ve been looking for an opening
All right .
What &apos;s this I hear about an environmental treaty thing ?
It &apos;s the Global Rehabili@@ tation Initiative , si@@ r .

He promised to be far less understanding in the future .
All right , look , we don &apos;t know anything about a dragon th@@ ief

You know , you two are gon@@ na get yourselves
Not everyone appreci@@ ates this way of life .
A@@ ye , G@@ ob@@ ber &apos;s right , son .
Best we keep to our own .
Besides , you &apos;ll have more important uses for your time .

Oh , my God .
Are you seeing this ?
I just don &apos;t understand how this is even possible .

I mean , we have the means , right ?
This is what we should be doing in the first place ,
David , look at this . There was a plane crash , David .
S@@ event@@ y-@@ seven people on board a flight from London to Madrid .
It happened five days ago .
Wa@@ it , wait . Are you saying that L@@ oll@@ ap@@ al@@ oo@@ za caused a plane crash ?
Because that sounds crazy , du@@ de .
Look , I &apos;m not crazy , ok@@ ay . It &apos;s cause and effect .
Som@@ ehow we caused the bask@@ etball team to not make the play@@ offs .
Our captain , Jus@@ tin X@@ el@@ ly , broke his leg on March 1st , right ?
We all know that never happened .
Then the bask@@ etball team didn &apos;t make the play@@ offs ,
And it just kept spreading
David
But where did you jump to ?
1@@ I doesn &apos;t matter . It &apos;s done
Stop it ! Stop it .
We don &apos;t have to und@@ o everything , ok@@ ay .
We ust have to make sure Jus@@ tin doesn &apos;t break his leg at Wal@@ ker &apos;s party .
We can fix it , man ! You got@@ ta trust me . I can fix it .
You can fix it ? By yourself ?
Ye@@ ah , you broke the p@@ act once and now you &apos;re gon@@ na do it again ?
Jesus , David .
1 mean , did you ever stop to think that maybe
No , I didn &apos;t .
Well , you know what I would have done ?
If I was as smart as you , if I could have built a time machine ?
Oh , sh@@ it . Come on ! Come on !
There he is ! Stop him !
David R@@ ask@@ in , Ac@@ lan@@ ta F D
I see him ! David , stop !
Get on the ground , David !
The susp@@ ect was last seen headed towards the school .
You guys take the front .
St@@ ev@@ ens , come with me around the back . Let &apos;s move !
Take the other side . Let &apos;s go .
Oh , sh@@ it !
Sus@@ p@@ ect inside .

So you take my keys and you disappear forever .
I need to go back to the beginning .
The tim@@ elines cris@@ sc@@ ross .
Ten years total .
You look just like him .
Wa@@ it . You came all the way to Y@@ emen looking for him .
You think he was lost or something ?
Come on .
You want to live ?
The airport &apos;s the only option .
The airport &apos;s known as the main ar@@ tery to the outside world .
It &apos;s the first thing IS@@ IL will shut down .
Plan@@ es were flying an hour ago . You got a phone ?
No , but he does .
Bur@@ ned it up jac@@ king off to Queen , though .
Gu@@ il@@ ty as charged .
C-@@ Note &apos;s organiz@@ ing a passage on the flight as we speak .
No , I can do this .
You really paid the equivalent of ten million ri@@ al
Not just any ashes , man .
Fre@@ d@@ die Mercur@@ y &apos;s ashes .
I would &apos;ve paid twice that .
Come on .
Keep your head down .
I think it &apos;s time we get s@@ ane and head to the airport .
No , no , no .
This is better . They control the station .
They &apos;ll never think to look for US here now .
I can see the mur@@ der@@ ers now .
Where ?
Not so fast .
Br@@ ing your weapons , I will stay on them .
And I call the shots now .
We checked . There &apos;s enough fuel to get us out of Y@@ emen .
Question is , can you fly an old bird like this ?
We &apos;ll find out .
There &apos;s another station , 30 miles outside S@@ ana &apos;@@ a .
We can find a way there , hop a train .
They won &apos;t anticip@@ ate US coming that way .
Dou@@ bling down on a bad bet .
Just like you did seven years back with the CIA .
Pay them whatever it took to make them go away .
More than they were already making :
Look , I , u@@ h .
I had a tra@@ cker in it , S@@ ara .
This little thing , but they didn &apos;t touch it .
I cont@@ acted the police before the meet ,
We n@@ ailed them .
Jacob .
I am so sorry I put you through this .
Let &apos;s do this .
A w@@ ren@@ ch and a pipe against AK@@ s .
It &apos;ll be fun .
I &apos;ve always wanted a cra@@ ck at these b@@ ast@@ ards .
DI paid my dues D
More will be here soon .
What do we do now ?
I need to take a break from making decisions .
Lin@@ c , airport ?
Airport .
I got someone I want you to talk to .
Oh , man !
Now that &apos;s a voice I never thought I &apos;d hear again .
Man , you got some expla@@ ining to do , brother ,
Where can we meet you ?
U@@ h , hang@@ ar two . Right off the main run@@ way .
But you better hur@@ ry your ass up .
Hang@@ ar two ?
We could be there in 20 minutes .
You &apos;ll stay with me when he &apos;s at Com@@ ic-@@ C@@ on or away for work .
Or if they accept D@@ ad@@ dy &apos;s application to live on Mars .
What are you talking about ?
Oh , there &apos;s this company
What should we name him ?
You know , I came in thinking &quot; S@@ eth , &quot; but ..

You applied for a mission
Would you have approved ?
Of course not .
Well , based on your reaction ,
Is@@ n &apos;t that right , Gi@@ us@@ ep@@ pe ?
You &apos;re not gon@@ na have time to glu@@ e it back on ..
you &apos;ll have to nail it .
With what ?
Does she have any pil@@ lows or wine glasses ?
She does .
Great .
N@@ either of those . Try a ham@@ mer !
Did that feel good ?
You feel like a big man now ?
Don &apos;t do drugs .
Stay in school .
Luke wants to qu@@ it magic .
That &apos;s not happening .
Well , see you guys at dinner .
Swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ t , don &apos;t you even want to talk about this ?
What &apos;s to talk about ? The k@@ id &apos;s a natural !
Ok@@ ay , let &apos;s play this out .
Even if he is one in a million ,
He becomes , what ..
A professional mag@@ ician !
Hon@@ ey , the boy has a gift .
You w@@ anna just throw that away ?
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s about thro@@ wing it away .
I &apos;m sorry I don &apos;t like magic as much as you ,
This isn &apos;t about magic .
No , it &apos;s about my life and you controlling it .
Look , you made a commitment . You will honor that commitment .
U@@ gh ! I hate it here !
Luke !
All right , young ladies and gentlemen ,

No , we &apos;re , like , a minute late , and that &apos;s &apos; cause of traffic .
And because I ti@@ pped over .
You didn &apos;t sn@@ ap my car seat right .

We &apos;re not doing this again . How do I bring it up ?
Well , for star@@ ters , you don &apos;t .
You su@@ ck it up .
D@@ ad , your hot wife
I &apos;m just so tired .

You never saw me .
Thank you very much .
Look , um , I thought about it ,
Trust me . I know what &apos;s best for you .
And watch your time . In the stage version ,
I hate this ! Why are you making me do this ?
Use that anger , Lu@@ k@@ ini .

Why don &apos;t you actually do some real work ?
Go gra@@ b me a ... .
You did a great job !
We were coming around the corner ,
Did you ask her why she was here ?
She was like com@@ at@@ ose .

If we don &apos;t hear anything by morning ,
M@@ om ?
M@@ om , what happened ?
When I was little , my mother tried to cur@@ l my hair .
Oh , well . We cri@@ ed
She named me Kat@@ r@@ ina so that she could call me K@@ at ,
Back to the problem at hand , getting Phi@@ l to fu@@ ck me .
Well , have you talked to him about it ?
I tried . All he says is that , he &apos;s got a lot on his mind ,
I know . I know Phi@@ l &apos;s not the bri@@ gh@@ test cra@@ yon in the box .
That is the under@@ statement of the century .
That &apos;s what I kind of like about him , you know ?
He &apos;s just simple .
I know that sounds per@@ verse , but he &apos;s kind of like my dad in that way .
You can scrat@@ ch the surface and there &apos;s just more surface .
I &apos;m gon@@ na get straight C &apos;s !
Show me
Phi@@ l is literally the boy next door .
And when he and his mother moved in last year , I instantly des@@ p@@ ised him .
He was so d@@ ull and st@@ up@@ id . I made fun of him .
Even earned a special nick@@ name : G@@ arb@@ age .
But then , one night that summer ,
Me , Bet@@ h and M@@ ick@@ ey , we were doing what we did every Wednesday .
Oh , tell me about it . Every week it &apos;s the same fu@@ cking people
Oh , my God .
What ?
Look what the b@@ ats dra@@ gged in .
What the hell is G@@ arb@@ age doing here ?
Oh , sh@@ it , he &apos;s coming over here .
Oh , God , what a fu@@ cking fre@@ ak .
Gu@@ y@@ S , be cool . Come on .
H@@ ey .
F@@ hi@@ l is , he &apos;s so excited
Sorry , I didn &apos;t know anyone was here .
F@@ hi@@ l , this is K@@ at &apos;s mother , Mrs. Conn@@ ors .
H@@ ey .
She just ... came by to say h@@ ello .
Ok@@ ay .
Well , I &apos;m just gon@@ na head to my room .
He &apos;s a nice boy .
You can rest assured , Eve , that my Phi@@ l will take good care of your daughter .
He &apos;s rented a tu@@ x , and everything
If your mother was so un@@ happy ,
God , I have no idea .
Because he was there ? I mean , he wanted to mar@@ ry her .
She had no other choice , maybe ?
I mean , she went to college , and she was working as a recep@@ tion@@ ist ,
I gu@@ ess life with my father must have been pretty ble@@ ak and mis@@ erable for her .
The night before she left I noticed that she started dres@@ sing different .
What do you mean , different ?
Can &apos;t say that I have .
Ok@@ ay . Sorry to bo@@ ther you , Mrs. Conn@@ ors .
Mrs. Conn@@ ors sounds so formal . Call me Eve .
All right .
You know , the time when I was your age doesn &apos;t seem so far away to me .
Well ,
F@@ hi@@ l , would you like to have dinner with us ton@@ ight ?
Oh , God , that &apos;s so hot .
One day I hope some mus@@ ky mach@@ o stu@@ d will fu@@ ck the sh@@ it out of me too .
Oh , it &apos;ll happen .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah . When ? When ?
I &apos;m so proud of you .
Why ? Because I fu@@ cked an old guy ?
Ye@@ ah . I mean , don &apos;t take this the wrong way , K@@ at ,
Oh , my God . What are you talking about ?
I mean , you lost all of that weight , like , what , three years ago ?
Ji@@ xe a fat ch@@ ick . Like me .
And M@@ ick@@ ey , who &apos;s basically a fat ch@@ ick in a sk@@ inny g@@ ay body .
You &apos;re cra@@ zy@@ . t &apos;s true .
Mr. Con@@ nor , this is Sher@@ yl from the L@@ oma Lin@@ da Police Department .
I &apos;m pleased to inform you that you passed your lie det@@ ector test .
Thank you for your cooperation , and have a nice day .
Why would your dad need to take a lie det@@ ector test ?
I have no idea .
Well , do you think the c@@ ops think he knows something ?
My dad ? Bet@@ h , have you met him ?
You look up clu@@ eless in the dic@@ tionary and there &apos;s a picture of him .
Do you want me to leave ?
What ? No . Wh@@ atever . I &apos;m sure it &apos;s nothing
Kids didn &apos;t spend too much money at the m@@ all , I hope ?
N@@ ope . I just picked up a few things .
H@@ ey , dad , there was a ... . message for you ,
Is there news about your mother ?
No . They said that you passed the lie det@@ ector test ?
Well , wh@@ o@@ op@@ -@@ de@@ e-@@ do . So , you going to join us for dinner , Bet@@ h ?
I.@@ I don &apos;t think so , Mr. Conn@@ ors .
D@@ ad , why would they want you to take a lie det@@ ector test ?
Be@@ ats me . It &apos;s standard procedure in cases like this , I gu@@ ess .
M@@ om ?
What is it ? What &apos;s going on ?
Is Phi@@ l a good fu@@ ck ?
Go to bed , mo@@ m .
Don &apos;t you turn your back on me !
Seri@@ ously , just go back to bed .
We &apos;ve only been dating for a couple of months .
So ? That &apos;s enough to know that he &apos;s hot , and smart ,
Cin@@ dy , you met Phi@@ l once , for a weekend .
Ye@@ ah , that was enough .
Wh@@ atever .
And you think you &apos;ve changed ?
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah . I &apos;d say so . I mean , I definitely feel more comfortable in my own skin .
School &apos;s going well ?
And I assume you haven &apos;t heard from your mother .
N@@ ope . Not a word
I don &apos;t know . It &apos;s kind of gotten to the point where
No problem , swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ t .
K@@ at , this is May . May , K@@ at .
I &apos;m so happy we finally get the chance to meet .
I &apos;ve heard so much about you .
Oh , me too .
I just don &apos;t want it to be aw@@ k@@ ward for you .
D@@ ad , I told you I am thri@@ lled that you met someone .
Seri@@ ously , you des@@ erve to be happy .
T@@ ook off your wedding ring
I put it back on when she &apos;s not around .
Why bo@@ ther ? I mean , mo@@ m left us .
She &apos;s the one who made that choice . I accept that now .
It &apos;s about time we et on with our lives .
M@@ om :
W@@ ha@@ c ?
I was doing the dishes and the water was so cold .
There was a spo@@ on at the bottom of the sink , and
What &apos;s the matter ?
Nothing .
Just have strange dreams sometimes .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah ?
Used to get them all the time . It &apos;s actually the first one I &apos;ve had in weeks .
Hard@@ ly ever talk about your mother .
There &apos;s not much to say . She &apos;s gone
I don &apos;t think I agree with that .
What do you think my dreams mean ?
You really want my opinion ?
As you know , we did an ex@@ haus@@ tive search for your mother .
Ex@@ haus@@ tive ? You guys bar@@ ely even looked for her .
Actually , a very thor@@ ough investigation was done
Not a single trace was ever found .
Wh@@ atever .
So where do you think she is ?
J think she &apos;s dead .
Wa@@ it .. whatever . Even if my mo@@ m did have a boy@@ friend ,
What ?
W ha
We did a thor@@ ough background check on your father .
Several inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es told us
My dad is a fu@@ cking w@@ im@@ p .
That &apos;s why he used to drive my mo@@ m crazy .
Not according to Bob and Mar@@ gie Car@@ l@@ sen .
Who are they ?
to live next door to them in Ri@@ ver@@ side
Put those muscles to good used for a change .
That &apos;s better . That &apos;s it . Come on , give it a wh@@ ack .
You &apos;re already here ?
Ye@@ ah . I was just helping your mo@@ m with dinner .
Unlike some people .
Hi , Mrs. Hill@@ man . It &apos;s K@@ at . I &apos;m sorry , were you in bed ?
Oh , oh , no . I ... I was just lying down .
I ... I haven &apos;t been feeling well .
Well , I &apos;m sorry to bo@@ ther you . But .. is Phi@@ l here ?
No . He isn &apos;t .
Do you know where he is ?
What the hell is going on down here ?
Nothing . We &apos;re just talking , and drinking champagne .
Well , it &apos;s time for your friends to leave .
What are you talking about ?
You heard me , K@@ at . The party is over .
Are you jo@@ king ?
D@@ ad , I hate to break it to you , but I &apos;m a fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; adult .
You can &apos;t tell me what to do
And I &apos;m saying your friends need to go home , now .
Oh , my God . What is your problem ?
Cool it . It &apos;s ... it &apos;s ok@@ ay , K@@ at .
B@@ ye , K@@ at . Have a safe flight , all right ?
You too .
H@@ ey .
Are you all right ?
You look dr@@ unk .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah ?
Look who &apos;s talking
What do you mean ?
I came by your house last week
Re@@ ally ?
I didn &apos;t get the message .
What did you want to talk to me about ?
Just been thinking about a lot of things .
You know , I feel like after .
my mother left , everything changed between us .
We were different . You were different .
Everything was different after that .
F@@ hi@@ l , where were you that day ? You were supposed to pick me up from school .
I told you . I was at Thom@@ as@@ &apos;
It doesn &apos;t matter anymore . You don &apos;t have to lie .
I just cannot keep living my life in the dark just , like , fu@@ cking wondering !
I can &apos;t help you , K@@ at .
I &apos;m sorry .
But I will tell you one thing
He &apos;s been keeping her up his sle@@ eve this whole time .
What do you mean ?
Don &apos;@@ f ask me
I &apos;m leaving .
You can &apos;t leave .
You &apos;re a susp@@ ect in the mysterious murder of Stu@@ art Blo@@ om .
I didn &apos;t know his last name was Blo@@ om .
Ye@@ ah , it &apos;s Blo@@ om .
Are you really gon@@ na lie on the floor
What do you think I was gon@@ na do at home ?
A g@@ az@@ elle blessed with a fla@@ ir for stor@@ yt@@ elling .
H@@ ey , what about this ? It looks like a receipt .
What &apos;s it for ?
For a cup of coffee .
But it &apos;s dated 20 years from now .
From the future ? !
How fun and imag@@ in@@ ative .
So one of us came back from the future
Does the g@@ az@@ elle with a fla@@ ir for stor@@ yt@@ elling
That &apos;s one small step for man ,
Ok@@ ay , ok@@ ay . Everything is fine .
You played some bas@@ eball , got a little up@@ set .
Light@@ ning shut out of your but@@ t , and now they &apos;re coming for you .
All right , all right . Earth isn &apos;t safe anymore .
Again , fair .
Wa@@ it ... Where are all the mus@@ h@@ rooms ?
Why am I still on Earth ? What did ...
Oh , no , I lost my rings !
What ?
Gu@@ ac .
No kids allowed in here .
What &apos;s he got on , some kin@@ da mask ?
He &apos;s actually 43 years old ,
That st@@ un@@ ts his growth , and makes him look ...
like ... like that .
The face I was born with ,
Make us a Mel@@ low Yellow please .
Ok@@ ay .
You ow@@ e me one .
I &apos;ve never sat on a bar st@@ ool before .
I &apos;m sorry . Did we get this on camera ?
How are you not dead ?
I have no idea .
But do you see me dancing ?
Yes , I saw your dance .
Is that all you &apos;ve got ?
No , but thank you for asking .
Son@@ ic !
Get back in the truck !
You go , I &apos;ll catch up .
I think that tank just had a baby .
In@@ coming !
It &apos;s my turn !
You just had one . It &apos;s mine !
H@@ ey , stop fighting , or I &apos;m taking that thing away !
Ye@@ ah , right , D@@ ad .
Where are you going ?
Just drive the car .
I &apos;ll take care of this .
And if I don &apos;t make it , just dit@@ ch me ,
Re@@ ally ?
I kin@@ da feel like I checked the &apos; save the life@@ &apos;
Now all I w@@ anna do
I w@@ anna check that box .
Ok@@ ay . I like that .
All right , everybody . Nothing to see here .
From their neighb@@ ors .
That &apos;s why , in the subur@@ bs , there is nothing more dec@@ ep@@ tive than a smile .
So what did ju@@ lie say , exactly ?
She said d@@ yl@@ an &apos;s not the same girl .
Not the same girl like she &apos;s changed ,
I know it sounds wei@@ rd , but ju@@ lie says d@@ yl@@ an does not remember anything about living here .
Well , maybe she blocked it out .
ra@@ iny day fund , they could make me testi@@ fy against you .
But if I were your wife ..
how are they going to find out ?
Oh , honey , people talk ... angry people dis@@ appointed people .
Come on@@ .@@ S@@ ay your lin@@ e.@@ If &apos;s my birthday .
Why n &apos;t I go check if there are some other ones ?
No , no , l don &apos;t need magaz@@ in@@ es.@@ I need company .
S@@ it down@@ .@@ You &apos;ve been bo@@ unc@@ ing around since you got here .
So ...
how do you like being the first lady of fair view :
I &apos;m fine .
So tell me some@@ th@@ ing.@@ When you go to a ri@@ b@@ bon cutting ,
You must be free@@ zing .
You know , l have the cut@@ est sha@@ w@@ l in the car ,
Boy , you really don &apos;t w@@ ann@@ abe here , do ya ?
I &apos;m fine .
did I ever tell you about my father ?
He had cancer , too .
Star@@ ted in the liver , went into his bones ,
Thanks for that encouraging story .
I &apos;m not finished .
Those last weeks , every day we thought we were gon@@ na lose him .
But after several failed attempts ,
she did have the key ...
to ka@@ therine &apos;s house .
oh , h@@ ey what &apos;s up ?
I was doing a little b@@ aking , and I was wondering if I could bor@@ row something .
Su@@ re@@ .@@ What do you need ... fl@@ our , Su@@ gar ?
What is going on ? Just give yourself some choices , m@@ ate
57 grand in debt .
And what , working in a call centre now
f course .
Ye@@ ah , but it don &apos;t have to be like that , does it ?
There &apos;s good jobs out there .
Well , it says leave it in the garden shed . Fill that card in , love
Fu@@ ck off , you fu@@ cking b@@ ast@@ ard ! Get to fu@@ ck !
Fu@@ cking tw@@ at .
Fu@@ ck &apos;s sake .
There &apos;s a do@@ o round there with massive teeth
You ow@@ e my dad
It was on the walls , all over me .
I &apos;ve ... I &apos;m covered in scrat@@ ches off her
Well , listen . Just calm down .
Don &apos;t tell us to calm down ! Are you gon@@ na pay us me extra hour ?
But it &apos;s aff@@ ecting everybody in the house .
My daughter , Li@@ za Jane , she &apos;s .
she &apos;s 11 and she &apos;s not sleeping right and .
My wife &apos;s up the wall with it .
So , er@@ m
I &apos;m not finishing till late .
Why are you asking me ?
Just get a replacement driver , won &apos;t cost you a p@@ enny
But , er@@ m
I@@ ve been speaking to the drivers as well
But , er@@ m ... Well , it &apos;s not that easy .
It &apos;s good you &apos;re using your initiative , though It shows planning ahead .
Ye@@ ah
It &apos;s just , er@@ m
I mean , even five days would be good .
I had four drivers in here last week .
First driver &apos;s sleeping on his m@@ ate &apos;s couch cos his wife &apos;s k@@ ick@@ ed him out .
Second driver , his sister had a stroke .
Third driver , he &apos;s got fu@@ cking pil@@ es and needs an operation .
Four@@ th driver , his daughter tried to commit suicide .
I can go on
My old man was a far@@ mer . He mil@@ ked c@@ ows .
All the complaints , the rage , the anger , the hate , I so@@ ak it all up
Do you w@@ anna know why &apos; m number one ?
C@@ os I keep this happy
They couldn &apos;t sive a sh@@ it if you fall as@@ le@@ ep at the wheel
All they care about is price , delivery and the item in the hand .
And all of that gets fed back into this box .
And this box is in competition
This decides who lives and who dies .
I want Apple , Amazon , Samsung Z@@ ara
The shareholders should er@@ ect a statue in the car park of me , Mal@@ on@@ ey ..
pat@@ ron sa@@ int of n@@ asty b@@ ast@@ ards .
You want a day off ? It &apos;ll cost you fu@@ cking E@@ 100 a go .
Hello
ome on , we &apos;ve got time to make up , let &apos;s so
Well , is he there ? Can I speak to him ?
No . Ye@@ ah . R@@ o , I understand . Er@@ m .
Altern@@ atively
i@@ ve your head a sha@@ ke , get through school , get a job , car , holiday
Because you &apos;ve got the best thing in life here .
You &apos;ve got a family that care about you , that love you .
You &apos;ve got a father that runs away from work to be here for you today
I do back you up .
And we &apos;re done for if you don &apos;t w@@ at h your temp@@ er . You &apos;re exhau@@ sted
It will be your fault if you can &apos;t control yourself
I can &apos;t have that
How can you even say that :
Once that line &apos;s crossed , you can &apos;t go back .
Can you not see it ?
Did you not see it . He came at me , it wasn &apos;t the other way round .
I was in the middle of you .
The treatment will be ag@@ res@@ sive .
It would be har@@ sh . You should prepare yourself .
I will be over@@ seeing all your procedures ,
Which means every sur@@ geon in this room
Welcome to the coun@@ sel@@ ing@@ . fol@@ ks .
See you in the OR .
Seri@@ ously , don &apos;t just stand there star@@ ing at me
Get out of here
He grab@@ bed his hands on your thro@@ at this morning .
You pre@@ ten@@ ding like nothing happened ?
Just focus on I@@ zz@@ ie .
H@@ unt literally tried to kill you .
He &apos;s bar@@ ely back form Iraq
That doesn &apos;t mean you have to stand by .
So like if he had a heart attack or stroke or lost a leg
So how is it anymore acceptable that I walk away from this ?
He &apos;s wounded . He &apos;s war wo@@ unds . Mer@@ edi@@ th .
It &apos;s not cut and drive .
And it is not as bad as you think it is .
Clear .
This might be it .
From your lips to God &apos;s ears
Oh , for the love of god .
If you want , I can help .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah ? I &apos;m not the one who needs help around here .
I &apos;m not the one who cut out half a woman &apos;s brain
I &apos;m not the one who half this hospital is talking about
So maybe you should spend a little less time
If you were the resident assi@@ sting me ,
dr@@ . b@@ ail@@ ey . I &apos;m not assi@@ sting you ,
But I &apos;m not gon@@ na let you get ru@@ sty .
A year from now , you need to be able to do this stuff .
You need to be able to teach your residents how to do it .
You really think I &apos;m gon@@ na be here a year from now ?
Yes , I do
For@@ c@@ eps .
Well , then , you &apos;d better make up for it in a minute .
I &apos;m gon@@ na see your dick
I &apos;m gon@@ na fu@@ cking see it
Ye@@ ah , but it does put people with the one .
It &apos;s got a 9@@ 9.@@ 8 % success rate .
But how do you know they &apos;re perfect matches ?
I mean , what if all it &apos;s actually doing
Each time you get a little bit more p@@ liable ,
And by that point you are so defeated and so exhau@@ sted
And then you have to live the rest of your life
It buil@@ ds up a complex profile .
Every crazy thought you &apos;ve ever had ,
Ye@@ ah , like , everything in your head .
Right . So if it &apos;s everything in your head ..
does it have thoughts ?
All right , so now you &apos;re gon@@ na say :
What if she looks at it ?
Once shor@@ tened , the exp@@ iry date cannot be extended .
Why ?
Everything happens for a reason .
Come on . Come on .
I know . B@@ enny told me .
So what does she want ?
I don &apos;t know .
She &apos;s just walking around , asking everybody ,
When &apos;s Ever@@ ett getting here ? &quot;
Go sit back down with your horn .
Mat@@ ter of fact , give it to me .
There &apos;s something wrong with it .
I used to play tro@@ mb@@ one .
Ever@@ ett !
Can I bring you my tape rec@@ order
I don &apos;t know what you said , F@@ ay .
You sound like a mouse being e@@ aten by a pos@@ sum .
Penn@@ y , give me your horn .
I said
We had to get out of that conversation .
So it &apos;s not broken ?
No . You can &apos;t waste tape , F@@ ay ,
Dou@@ b@@ le-@@ dealing de@@ vil@@ -@@ dog . That had me so sc@@ ared .
You know I paid for that with my own money .
You can always do that if someone &apos;s a wet ra@@ g .
Tell them , &quot; It &apos;s broken . We &apos;ll have to res@@ che@@ dule . &quot;
Well , I can &apos;t do that to someone .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah , you can . Why not ?
It &apos;s not lying .
It &apos;s st@@ opping someone from embar@@ rass@@ ing themselves .
Not if you don &apos;t make them feel embar@@ rass@@ ed .
P@@ utting up the numbers means
I &apos;m not putting up any numbers .
I &apos;m sorry , you two . I &apos;m gon@@ na need to see a license for that .
Oh , this ain &apos;t no sh@@ ot@@ gun , P@@ app@@ y Fred .
I don &apos;t talk about other people &apos;s business .
Then come up with some other way to fill up this tape rec@@ order .
I can &apos;t . I just get so nervous
Although , I was enjoying it back there
It &apos;s just you and me talking .
Tell me the cra@@ zi@@ est c@@ aller you ever had .
Oh , I know what I can tell you .
Not about a c@@ aller , but about
Can I tell you about that ?
You certainly can ,
That &apos;s not my middle name .
I know it isn &apos;t . I don &apos;t care .
I mean , I didn &apos;t know ,
What else you got in there ?
U@@ h , just my mou@@ th@@ piece
Oh , really ?
You don &apos;t believe me , do you ? You &apos;re just pul@@ ling my leg .
No , I &apos;m not pul@@ ling your leg .
I love it . I &apos;m inter@@ viewing you . I &apos;m playing a part .
I just remembered two more stories .
Do we have time to do those two ?
Absol@@ utely we do . Let &apos;s fill it up .
All right , if you like that , bra@@ ce your brain for this .
There &apos;s this article about these tubes ...
You tell me all about it .
All right , hold on ,
H@@ old on , &apos; cause I w@@ anna read it to you the way it was written ,
All right , here you go .
So , &quot; Picture a man in New York City , in Times Square .
And he walks down a set of stairs into a sub@@ way tunnel ,
Ye@@ ah , Just for a sec for the game . They were getting off the bus .
They were tall .
Oh , no . Re@@ ally ?
Ye@@ ah .
They got a b@@ unch of Indian boys on their team too ,
Maybe there &apos;s a couple of families ,
Prob@@ ably means they &apos;re
And I don &apos;t mean that because they &apos;re Indi@@ ans .
When they put on their jer@@ se@@ ys , they looked like grow@@ n-@@ ups .
That means we &apos;re gon@@ na lose .
H@@ ey , were the lights fli@@ ck@@ ering in here at all ?
No . Why ?
Oh , just &apos; cause they were fli@@ ck@@ ering over at the school .
Ar@@ lo &apos;s working on it though .
Last time , when I was still teaching ,
All right , I &apos;m off .
Oh , the line to San Mi@@ ri@@ al has got a permanent signal ,
Ok@@ ay , b@@ ye .
Number , please ?
Are you listening to the radio right now ?
No , I was watching TV .
Can you turn your radio on and tell me
Like what ?
Like ...
something that just came in through the board
They came through on top of each other .
All right . Connect it .
All right .
I &apos;ve never heard that before .
Ye@@ ah , me neither . And then this lady called .
She said there was something going on out of town
Then I called Eth@@ el
And when did you say my show got cut into ?
But you trust your su@@ peri@@ ors and you follow orders .
But this one ... wor@@ ried me .
And why is that ?
Prob@@ ably &apos; cause it was so secre@@ tive .
So what happened next ?
Well , we built the ceiling over this thing , carefully .
And then when they were done with us ,
And when the prop@@ ellers had started sp@@ inning
What sound ?
The same sound you just played ton@@ ight .
You sure it was the same ?
Oh , I couldn &apos;t forget it .
And when we finally took off and I looked out the window ,
And then the sound disappeared and we got further away .
And when I got back , then I started getting really sick .
And in the next few weeks ,
So now I didn &apos;t brea@@ the so good .
And I think wh@@ ate@@ ver@@ . that area of the desert
Maybe radiation .
The power cut off at the radio ...
You work at the radio station ?
I do Highway Hits .
It was something in the sky .
He did the old stuff .
I do the new ...
No , we don &apos;t listen to ...
I don &apos;t like new stuff , but Ger@@ rie does .
Number please .
Yes , Ever@@ ett &apos;s here . Would you like to speak with him here ?
Ok@@ ay , I &apos;ll connect you .
Ever@@ ett , come to board one !
There &apos;s a lady calling in for the station !
Give me a .@@ 38 air bur@@ st on the following grid .
Wa@@ it , what ?
Who is that ? Is that Stri@@ ke Op@@ s ?
I don &apos;t know .
This is Cob@@ ra , dro@@ pping down to Care@@ free .
Sir , Vi@@ per 31 went below ra@@ dar and a right turn .
The b@@ unk@@ ers below were empty .
T@@ f there ever was a Rain@@ maker there
War@@ lord 2
And no one from Stri@@ ke Operation to the F@@ ent@@ ag@@ on ..
Has ever heard of this call sign .
Who@@ ever it was had the confirmation codes
You do have the hut tap@@ es ?
Defense knows the tap@@ es are missing ..
Which is very fortun@@ ate if you &apos;re a pilot who &apos;ve
Any of these men could &apos;ve destroyed the hut tap@@ es .
Pur@@ su@@ ing to the Article 32 hearing
But the prosec@@ ution it &apos;s in@@ ability to produce Hut Tap@@ es .
Has led us to a stal@@ em@@ ate .
Exc@@ use me , Your Hon@@ or ,
C@@ alled Rain@@ maker , which was a rare opportunity of immense national interest .
But even more significant than that
Whether these men ever see the light of day again
But God help the U.S. Navy if they &apos;re allowed to remain in it .
The best thing you can do for yourselves and for your services ..
Is to res@@ ign your comm@@ ision
I believe the Pro@@ sec@@ ut@@ or will agree to a full dism@@ iss@@ al .
Want to come play with us until your deal comes through ?
Thank you , but no .
The money &apos;s dec@@ ent .
L@@ ooks like you could use some .
I am three steps from being a milli@@ on@@ aire .
And one from being broke .
Maybe .
I might end up working for you . Al@@ right ?
My pil@@ ots only hit the target 30 % of the time .
So this is about more money .
We &apos;ve wa@@ ited centuries for Our hom@@ eland
Until the Americans are gone .
We &apos;re doing this for our freedom .
You and your friends at Ge@@ op@@ et@@ rol .
You &apos;re in this for the money .
Well , T@@ em@@ ir , I &apos;m glad we put that on the table ..
So let &apos;s put something else on the table .
If you and your people ..
Keep doing what you &apos;ve been doing
No money ,
And no freedom .
Do you know the best place to see the air show ?
The air show ?
The planes ? Air show ?
You got that ? I &apos;m sorry we were late .
That was my fault .
It will not happen again , ok@@ ay ?
But I think we should be ok@@ ay .
Hi , is this good for both of us ?
This is me , this is my friend . Is that ok@@ ay ?
And the next time you have a plan , it had better work .
Unlike the last two times
How long is that flight ?
To@@ o long , man .
Good to have you back , man .
can &apos;t wait to hear all about it .
Flight ad@@ versary , baby .
You sure you don &apos;t want to hang out ?
No , man .
I need some sleep .
The jet lag &apos;s going on .
M@@ om says we have gu@@ ardian angel
A Special Force , like my dad .
He must be a very bra@@ ve man .
He &apos;s pretty bra@@ ve .
Charlie ?
You want to meet my mo@@ m ?
No , thanks . Got@@ ta run .
Do you really think Web@@ ster can fix our records ?
That &apos;s how it &apos;s put .
What do we have to do ?
All I can say is
And those guys who choose to stay .
Will be fully brief@@ ed tomorrow .
If it means to clear our name
H@@ ey look , guys .
Some of us have history with this thing here , so .
I just don &apos;t see any point you &apos;re taking any unnecessary risks .
And let &apos;s be honest , the money is bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it .
Wa@@ it a minute .
Not if we pull it .
It &apos;s not about money for me .
I got ker@@ os@@ ene in my blood .
I &apos;m a fighter pilot .
Al@@ right .
Look man .
I &apos;ve lost too many friends already , So ..
I &apos;m out .
I am a weekend war@@ ri@@ or who flies cargo .
I &apos;ll leave the shooting up to you and the rest of the cow@@ boys , this isn &apos;t for me .
Well , directors don &apos;t like re@@ writes , you know ?
You don &apos;t like it when old characters s@@ ne@@ ak back into the script .
It gets really mess@@ y .
But then you &apos;re familiar with them .
You know what makes them ti@@ ck and it &apos;s new again .
A drama can be exciting .
And dangerous .
T live in Russia .
I live in a plane .
It &apos;s a High Al@@ titude High Opening drop .
It &apos;ll take about 45 minutes to gli@@ de the 20 miles over the border .
Across the Z@@ ange@@ zur Mountains to Azer@@ ba@@ i@@ jan .
Exc@@ use me si@@ r .
I don &apos;t jump out of planes , I fly them .
You &apos;ve all had jump training , right ?
Yes , si@@ r , but I was not very good at it .
Can we just fly commercial to Azer@@ ba@@ i@@ jan ?
Techn@@ ically , you &apos;re not even in the country .
You &apos;ll use GPS to guide you to the air@@ field
So I get this call .
It seems that my ex
I was wor@@ ried about you .
Your friends were wor@@ ried about you .
Every@@ body &apos;s wor@@ ried about poor old Tom ?
My wing man , finally get to my left door .
Go to hell ! That &apos;s my girl
I always ad@@ mire your sp@@ unk , your ambi@@ tion .

Welcome . S@@ it down , my friend sit down .
A little tea for our guests , please .
Enjoy it .
Actually thank you , but .
We really have to get back to work , so .
Put that back , Vas@@ qu@@ ez .
I &apos;m afraid there &apos;s been a change of plan .
We &apos;re going to have to det@@ ain you for a while .
J don &apos;t know
He was a poor man .
You can &apos;t remember your great@@ -@@ grand@@ father &apos;s name
100 years for now , mankind might not even be here .
And if they were , all they &apos;d remember ..
Would not be our name , but whether or not we had money .
Tom .
Is are you gon@@ na be a rich man .
Or a poor man ?
No no no , I know you &apos;ve been patient , I know this is hard .
But in a year when that oil re@@ constitute in its pure form .
Roger that .
We just change the plan .
Why wake a sleeping bear ?
Why don &apos;t we just drop Rain@@ maker and be done with it ?
They &apos;d never had the chance .
You kill the bear in its sleep .
Int@@ els said the Russi@@ ans are gon@@ na help the Americans .
Tom Cra@@ ig taught a lot of these men to fly .
What if he gets his loyalty confused ? You want to take that chance ?
This is the moment we were talking about .
And what about my son ?
Your son is gon@@ na be here safe with me .
What &apos;s more , your boy is gon@@ na watch his father fight for freedom .
What other k@@ id would get such a chance ?
You think about that
The biggest difference is that you can not hide from her ,
Close up to the General , ask him if he car@@ ed
I can see him .
He may start soon .
Take him down now
Ye@@ ah Cob@@ ra .. To the moon , Cob@@ ra !
You take the one on the ground .
Y@@ a all@@ an
12 : 00 clock , coming right at us . Two of them .
Make that three make that three . Sh@@ it
Let &apos;s b@@ low them out of the sky .
See that right there ? That &apos;s him .
Your father &apos;s in that plane . It &apos;s better than video games .
You got@@ ta get us out of here , Cob@@ ra !
I &apos;m trying !
Vi@@ per , where the hell are you , man ?
We &apos;re on our way .
Anna , is Gra@@ cho@@ v with you ?
We can &apos;t do that man .
25@@ ,000 feet . They &apos;re still with us .
H@@ old on , Ca@@ j@@ un .
What the hell did you do ?
Nice move , Cob@@ ra . Some@@ thing I didn &apos;t teach you .
We got two mis@@ si@@ les remaining
Some@@ thing &apos;s not right , here .
It &apos;s a tra@@ p . P@@ ull up !
Don &apos;t worry , ust gon@@ na cut you lose .
You did a good job .
Put your hand up .
Good listen .
I lost my father when I was your age .
We &apos;re strug@@ gling here .
Why don &apos;t you take a shot at him ?
Som@@ ehow it just doesn &apos;t seem like the right thing to do .
First left , then immediate right
It &apos;s taking us exactly where we want to go .
It &apos;s getting nar@@ ro@@ wer . It &apos;s all part of the plan .
Now , put your foot down and drive a little faster .
Good plan .
All we have to do is get over two 20-@@ foot walls
Take another left through the window .
After you .
And now you have miss t@@ eller .
My work here is done .
We already knew all that .
Your job here is done when I tell you it &apos;s done .
You told me this was gon@@ na be a simple extrac@@ tion .
T@@ t shoul@@ da been .
I didn &apos;t ask you to light up half of east Berlin .
They were waiting for me .
Don &apos;t fl@@ atter yourself . They follow everybody .
What was waiting for me was bar@@ ely human .
I tell myself , solo ,
A little tired this morning , si@@ r ?
You &apos;d be , too , if you &apos;d been up all night
Any@@ thing in particular , si@@ r , or .. ?
Or are you just looking ?

Nevertheless , you &apos;re gon@@ na have to swal@@ low it .
Where we going with this , si@@ r ?
It is now run by his son , Alexander ,
Al , he &apos;s more play@@ boy than ty@@ co@@ on .
But she .
Well , now , she &apos;s something else al@@ together .
All our inform@@ ac@@ ion indicates a le@@ th@@ al combin@@ a tion
She &apos;s the real fan@@ atic
We believe they &apos;re responsible for Dr. t@@ eller &apos;s dis@@ appearance .
How .
Imag@@ ine the consequences
We have no choice but to work together on this .
Your mission is to in@@ filtr@@ ate this organization
It will be located on a computer disk .
And wh@@ o@@ ever has that disk will simply be
You , solo , are to investigate
We &apos;ll leave you two to get acquain@@ ted .
O@@ leg . Give my regards to N@@ ina .
Ob@@ viously , i was brief@@ ed about you .
Your corrupt and criminal background ...
Until you were caught
But what interests me , given your profile ,
I concluded it must be to counter@@ act
My woman would never wear anything like that .
What &apos;s he doing here ?
I told you . We &apos;re te@@ aming up with the Russi@@ ans .
Do@@ esn &apos;t get any more Russian than the red per@@ il here .
And why did he call me his woman ?
Give me a minute to explain .
It &apos;s your cover .
He &apos;s an architect design@@ ing a new resort
The Ri@@ us@@ sian minister of culture
He &apos;s also managed to secure a visa for his fi@@ ance .
And naturally , you &apos;d introduce him
And what about you ? What &apos;s your cover ?
Jack de@@ ven@@ y ,
Perhaps you give them to me .
I think your feet are a little small .
Then g@@ im@@ me some money for coffee .
D@@ ear@@ est .
Give the gentlemen something for coffee .
Enjoy your coffee .
Good morning .
I enjoyed last night .
Is better for the mission
What does that mean ?
It means i like my woman strong
Come on .
Maybe I get you present .
P@@ ump the bra@@ kes , my Russian friend .
We might be engaged , but I &apos;m my own woman .
Besides , I wouldn &apos;t be wearing my engagement ring
I wanted to make sure it was serious .
Or were you , perhaps , ash@@ amed ?
Why would she be ash@@ amed ?
I know that the equity of ari@@ st@@ oc@@ ratic blood
But a good German girl knows never to mix
Don &apos;t be so protective .
Nice to see you .
Wa@@ ver@@ ly runs the shipping department at British oil .
Exc@@ use me , i said I need to use the sink .
W@@ ha@@ c

I noticed you &apos;re very good with your hands .
He said , &quot; use the ladies &apos; &quot;

Oh , really ? Do you want to fix it ?
I &apos;d be delighted .
So I Just need the w@@ ren@@ ch .

You see , each one of us has a dest@@ iny .
And I believe I can help you with yours .
You can see the future ?

Al@@ one

What &apos;s he done ?
Super agent here decided to have some fun
They had it coming
Your new boy@@ friend is a Nazi .
Me@@ et me on the gan@@ try in five minutes .
Try not to get lost .
I didn &apos;t find anything
Why ?
I thought that was my father &apos;s watch .
Make mistake .
And what exactly did you do to him ?
At k@@ g@@ b , we call it the k@@ iss .
It takes years to master .
Although he &apos;s standing u@@ pri@@ ght , he &apos;s completely un@@ conscious .
He &apos; be like this for 20 minutes .
Can &apos;t touch .
Generator &apos;s back on .
Why do you think they have radiation tools and suit
Next to hidden button .
We wouldn &apos;t have found that without my father &apos;s watch .
Want to have a go ?
Be my guest .
I thought I was doing so well .
Oh , don &apos;t be so hard on yourself .
You were doing fantas@@ tically well .
The fault doesn &apos;t lie in your performance .
However , you couldn &apos;t control the loyalty of young Gab@@ y .
She gave you up like an un@@ wanted kit@@ ten .
I know my father is here and that he works for you .
And how is that
And the American your wife has been enter@@ taining
The Russi@@ ans and the Americans thought they were using me ,
Re@@ ally ?
She seemed so innocent .
You &apos;re not the first man to have fallen
It &apos;s a tracking device .
He &apos;s probably out there in the woods
I &apos;m sure my ..
If you can catch him .
I think I need to make a telephone call .
what are you doing ?
&apos;ve been here before .
And last time , I fell rather b@@ adly and hurt my head .
I &apos;m afraid that isn &apos;t going to stop you getting hurt .
Sle@@ ep well , Napoleon .
Only my mother calls me Napoleon .
Mum@@ my says h@@ ello .
And my personal favorite :
What history has failed to relate
And today , you have the privil@@ ege
Hello again , Mr. solo .
My ap@@ ologies .
There &apos;s a short in the wir@@ ing
I keep telling the ma@@ est@@ ro to moder@@ ni@@ ze , but al@@ as .
We have contact .
My ap@@ ologies .
W@@ on &apos;t happen again .
I &apos;m so sorry I can &apos;t stay to finish you off myself .
Ru@@ di &apos;s never in a r@@ ush , but s@@ adly , I am .
And I want it to be slow
Once upon a time , there was a little boy .
You wouldn &apos;t describe him
He was neither tall nor hand@@ some ,
Because of this boy &apos;s apparent short@@ com@@ ings ,
Year merged with mis@@ erable year
But what the other boys didn &apos;t understand about their victim
Re@@ ady ?
There are two kinds of torture , Mr. solo .
One is for the extrac@@ tion of information .
The other
I must admit , this does get fru@@ str@@ ating
&apos;m in an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned mood .
With the p@@ liers .
I never thought I &apos;d say this .
I &apos;m actually quite pleased to see you .
You doing ok@@ ay , cow@@ boy ?
I thought I found all your tra@@ ckers .
You did . T@@ ust not the ones in your shoes .
Do you mind ?
You don &apos;t have to do things to me to make me talk .
I &apos;ll tell you everything I know .
You won &apos;t be able to stop me .
What about Gab@@ y ?
She betra@@ yed you . I will testi@@ fy .
Don &apos;t k@@ ick yourself . She fo@@ ol@@ ed me , too .
T@@ f &apos;s not the same .
I &apos;m yours to command .
Will you give us a minute ?
Don &apos;t go anywhere .
I &apos;ll be right here .
what do you think we should do ?
We have to get to that island .
What should we do wich him
You &apos;re the one he &apos;s been having fun with .
On the one hand , we need him ,
But on the other hand , i know exactly what &apos;ll happen .
He &apos;ll strike a deal and struggle out of it .
He &apos;s prepared to sell his ass on this ,
He &apos;ll be out within months
A man with that skill set &apos;s never w@@ anting for employment .
So , what do you think we should do ?
Just give me a minute .
He fixed the gli@@ t@@ ch .
Dam@@ n .
I left my jacket in there .
I believe your instructions are to follow me , so , u@@ h ...
Follow me .
Very well done , my dar@@ ling .
They will send an army to stop us .
Then we must give them an appropriate welcome .
The line is secured . You &apos;re now connected , si@@ r .
They are the key
Kill the Russian , if necessary .
Gent@@ lemen , can you hear me ?
Well , now if the Nazis are due to take delivery
A luxurious 14 hours in which to sei@@ ze the island ,
There is also , of course ,
You have British agent in this ?
Well , she &apos;s not British . &quot; She &quot;
I &apos;m starting to smell the ir@@ ony .
Gab@@ y &apos;s working for you , isn &apos;t she ?
Oh , well done , solo , y@@ ep , y@@ ep .
You got there in the end .
My father has been un@@ well .
He &apos;s ready now to res@@ ume his work .
A daughter &apos;s touch .
Gab@@ y has agreed to assist me to assure I finish in time .
Now that is a good idea .
You &apos;re wrong .
It was the only way she could stay in the game .
She knew that the ring you gave her was bu@@ gged
That would give even the average Russian agent
And , of course , you are not average ,
Let me translate this into English .
You told Gab@@ y to drop us in it
But now you &apos;ve lost her ,
Well , that is a very poor translation , solo , but ...
Well , in a n@@ ut@@ shell , yes , please .
Thank you very much .
So , what does that do ?
Well , it &apos;s known as a cou@@ pler .
It sends a signal which enables another mis@@ si@@ le
t &apos;s left over from when this was a war@@ head
Now that we are converting it to nuclear , it &apos;s red@@ und@@ ant .
I &apos;m sorry .
We &apos;re nearly done , Victoria .
Those are the words we &apos;ve been waiting to hear .
What are you doing ?
Let &apos;s both stop playing games , shall we ?
Put her in a cell .
If you don &apos;t hear from me in 20 minutes , kill her .
That &apos;s how long you have to finish this .
You can start by putting back the correct lens , professor .
Please .
You &apos;ll get killed , and I &apos;m not gon@@ na let that happen .
You want to go , you got@@ ta go through me .
We made it all the way home from Iraq alive ,
Is there a point to this or ...
I think you love me .
I think you love Crist@@ ina
And I think that you tried to get Sh@@ ep@@ herd to get rid of me
Her or me ?
Fine . No one .
No one . I &apos;m choosing no one .
I &apos;m taking myself out of this equ@@ ation , and I am ...
oh , my god .
He &apos;s dead .
We can &apos;t go to the I.@@ C.@@ U .
We stay here , we &apos;re sitting du@@ cks .
I &apos;m taking this patient out of here .
Who are you calling ?
It &apos;s half inst@@ inc@@ t and half impro@@ v ,
For a resident , I &apos;m very good .
You can &apos;t be in there .
I can &apos;t do this if you &apos;re in there star@@ ing at me
We &apos;re ready for you .
April ...
Mer@@ edi@@ th is gon@@ na sit here on the floor .
I want you to stay with her .
Come back now !
Stop cr@@ ying .
Look , it took me a long time to find him ,
And even then , it took me a long time
And now that I realize that ...
he &apos;s lying on a table in there and my best friend &apos;s
You don &apos;t get to cry about that .
Re@@ ed was my best friend .
She died today .
We need to get to the O.@@ R. !
Sh@@ h . Please , stop y@@ elling .
Turn the elev@@ ators back on ! Turn them back on !
Oh , dam@@ n it !
Oh , my god ! Turn the elev@@ ators back on !
Dr. B. , please , please . Please .
That man is still here somewhere .
Turn the elev@@ ators back on !
And he &apos;ll hear us . Please . Sh@@ h .
Stop , stop , stop . Please , Dr. B .
Ok@@ ay , ok@@ ay ...
You step back .
You ... stay back .
O@@ wen , I can &apos;t stop . I have to keep going .
I know . I know . Just keep going . Keep going .
You stop or I will shoot you in the head .
H@@ ey ! H@@ ey ! That is the woman that I love .
You shoot her , you touch her , and I will kill you !
I said stay back .
Maybe I shoot you first .
I shoot you , and then I shoot her
I didn &apos;t come here for this . My wife is dead .
He &apos;s responsible .
M@@ mm@@ -@@ h@@ mm .
People been kind . And generous .
Did a young man named Bob@@ by De@@ Angel@@ o stop by ?
Ye@@ ah , he come by .
His parents are friends of ours .
Was there any@@ body with him ?
Ye@@ ah . Um , this other boy , Chris .
Christopher Morgan
Was it this young man ?
M@@ mm@@ -@@ h@@ mm . Ye@@ ah , that &apos;s him .
I think P@@ am fixed him a plate . There was so much food .
Bob@@ by asked us for a picture once of St@@ ev@@ ie .
He , u@@ h ..
He come over here and wanted to show St@@ ev@@ ie a ring
And then he asked me for a picture of St@@ ev@@ ie .
And I gave him one .
Ok@@ ay . Ok@@ ay .
Well , we &apos;re gon@@ na need to get some pictures of St@@ ev@@ ie
Also , we &apos;re , u@@ h , gon@@ na need to go ahead and get
Just , you know , part of our investigation .
It &apos;s ok@@ ay .
Oc@@ ean@@ side PD . How may I direct your call ? U@@ h-@@ hu@@ h . Right
Last time I seen St@@ ev@@ ie was about a year and a half ago .
When I sold him some ice cream .
I &apos;m sure I sold ice cream to all three of those boys .
I used to be involved in the W@@ ic@@ can religion . White wit@@ ch@@ craft .
When you would go out to Rob@@ in H@@ ood W@@ oods ,
With Chris and Michael .
Did you ever see anything out there ?
We saw , u@@ h , men .
I ran and Jes@@ sie caught me .
Um , he tied me up .
He tried to cut me on my side .
I k@@ ick@@ ed him .
Then he grab@@ bed my hands and made me cut Chris .
This is Det@@ ective Br@@ yn Rid@@ ge of the West Mem@@ ph@@ is Police Department ,
Jes@@ sie , on Wednesday , May 5 , 1993 , early in the morning ,
Ye@@ ah , I did . J@@ ason Bal@@ d@@ win called me
Then I went with them up to the ... Up to the Rob@@ in H@@ ood .
I represent Jes@@ sie Mis@@ sk@@ el@@ ley .
This is Paul Ford from Ton@@ es@@ bor@@ o .
He represents J@@ ason Bal@@ d@@ win .
And Val Price is the public def@@ ender who &apos;s been appointed
I understand Tes@@ sie has rec@@ an@@ ted his con@@ fession .
Does that surprise you ?
No . I@@ it &apos;s hard to believe anyone
G@@ ot any experts lined up ?
I &apos;ve got a doctor who will testi@@ fy that Jes@@ sie
He was once diagnos@@ ed as ment@@ ally re@@ tar@@ ded .
Do you think he &apos;s guilty ?
In my experience , most of them are .
So Mr. La@@ x , if they &apos;re most likely guilty ,
Because if you don &apos;t have a strong case ,
And I can &apos;t stand by and watch that happen .
He &apos;s got her l@@ ame car@@ ved on his arm .
And I worry about that baby .
Why ?
Because of the rum@@ or that they &apos;re going to sacrifice it to Satan .
You &apos;re saying you actually believe that ?
No . I &apos;m working with them .
You &apos;re working for them ? What are you , like a lawyer &apos;s assistant ?
I &apos;m an investig@@ ator .
But you won &apos;t be representing me in court .
No . No , I &apos;m not allowed to do that .
So I &apos;m just supposed to trust you ? Tell you everything
Those c@@ ops are sc@@ ary , ok@@ ay ?
They will do anything to get people to say what they want to hear .
Why would so many people say all these things about you ?
Why did those girls say people were wit@@ ches back in Sal@@ em ?
Any time anything wei@@ rd happens around here ,
didn &apos;t attack him . He offered it .
I did that with a knife . That &apos;s my girlfriend &apos;s name .
I &apos;ve been cutting myself for a long time .
Why ?
There &apos;s power in the blood ,
Through drinking the blood of others .
By b@@ iting , cutting
I &apos;ve been doing it since I was , i@@ ke , 10 J@@ ears old .
These people think I &apos;m a Sat@@ amic leader . &apos; m not .
And they listen to that music .
And everybody knows they .... I heard from a b@@ unch of people
You think the way they dress had something to do with the
You don &apos;t dress like that when you ... When you , um ....
I got it back yesterday , and I &apos;ve been wearing it on my head , like that .
Did he like sc@@ ou@@ ting ?
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah . He loved it . He loved it . He did .
Um .. Ye@@ ah , he did .
I saw you on TV .
What the hell are you doing ?
You &apos;re supposed to be in mo@@ ur@@ ning .
You &apos;re not acting right .
What &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
On the TV . Tre@@ ating his scar@@ f like some kind of pro@@ p .
Ac@@ ting like a go@@ d@@ dam@@ n sil@@ ly f@@ ool .
I &apos;m not acting at all , Ter@@ ry . Are you ?
Is that what you &apos;ve been doing ?
I think maybe you &apos;re glad St@@ ev@@ ie &apos;s gone
What the hell are you talking about ?
Every time I spent time with him ,
You shut up !
What ? You &apos;ll hit me ? Now that he &apos;s gone ,
Go ahead . H@@ it me . H@@ it me . I d@@ are you , hit me .
M@@ omm@@ y ? D@@ ad@@ dy ?
H@@ ey , I tried you at home .
I need to talk to you about something , in person .
Will you meet me for lunch tomorrow , 1 : 00 at the Ar@@ cade ?
It &apos;s really important . Ok@@ ay . Good night .
Tell me what happened when you got to Rob@@ in H@@ ood W@@ oods .
Jes@@ sie started running and caught Steve .
Then Michael and Chris j@@ ump@@ ed out of the tree .
Then , um , they took them ,
Jes@@ sie and Dam@@ ien picked him up
And nobody knows what happened but me .
What would you like ?
May I have a tea , please ?
Thanks for meeting me . I know you &apos;re very busy .
It &apos;s good to hear from you ,
The State Police . They called me .
Then they came by my office ,
They knew everything about our divor@@ ce proce@@ eding
I was so insul@@ ted , I was so angry ,
I mean , you &apos;re a respected man in this city . You &apos;re not on trial here .
TA &apos;s fine
He can send another ome .
It &apos;s just that with all the pap@@ er@@ work in the case ,
These boys that you &apos;re helping
The police seem so certain . Are you sure you want to do this ?
Yes . Yes , I am .
It &apos;s just that sometimes you take these things so personally .
You know , you lose perspective . You get ob@@ s@@ essed .
You don &apos;t have to worry about me anymore .
You know , if the police are so go@@ d@@ dam@@ ned certain about their case
You know , I just remembered , I have to be in court . Early
R@@ on , please don &apos;t .
And then we followed Det@@ ective Allen into the woods .
All the way down to Ten M@@ ile Ba@@ you .
This trial &apos;s a waste of time . We all know he &apos;s guilty .
We ought to just fr@@ y him and get it over with .
Then maybe these journalist par@@ as@@ ites can go back to wherever they come from .
cra@@ w@@ led on my hands and kne@@ es and felt along with my hands
This ended up being a white shirt
Z es
U@@ h , yes , si@@ r . I played this .
And nobody knows what happened but me .
And after hearing the tape , what was the def@@ endant &apos;s reaction ?
Jes@@ sie immediately stated that he wanted to tell us about it .
Then he said that he was present when the boys were mur@@ dered .
Now , you got in front of you pictures
But this court will not toler@@ ate any verb@@ al out@@ bur@@ st ,
The ver@@ dic@@ ts read as follows .
&quot; We the jury find Jes@@ sie L@@ loyd Mis@@ sk@@ el@@ ley Junior guilty
&quot; And of second degree murder in the deaths of Christopher B@@ yers
The sentence . How do you fee about the sentence ?
Do you think it was a just and a proper sentence ?
Life plus 40 ? Well , it &apos;s fine with me .
It &apos;s one down , two to go .
And the good Lord said Luci@@ fer and a third of the angels
And they pra@@ yed to their De@@ vil and they pra@@ yed to their Satan ,
Wild , crazy or@@ gi@@ es , I &apos;ve been told .
There &apos;s a war going on .
It &apos;s a war between Satan , Luci@@ fer and the Lord .
I mean , like something suspicious or strange ?
Ye@@ ah . He did do something strange . Very strange .
He gave this as a gift to the documentary crew .
So when were you planning on telling us about it ?
Mr. F@@ og@@ lem@@ an released the records concerning this knife yesterday .
But you &apos;ve known about it for months . How could you not tell US about it ?
Well , we had to send it to the lab first . DNA testing .
There was blood on the knife .
Mrs. Hut@@ ch@@ es@@ on , you &apos;re already involved .
You feature promin@@ ently in the prosec@@ ution &apos;s case .
And from what I can tell , you &apos;re the only real link
No . No , I can &apos;t talk about it .
You got@@ ta ask Don .
Det@@ ective Donald Bra@@ y ?
Yes .
She brought her k@@ id in the day after those boys went missing
Michael Moore and Chris B@@ yers are his two best friends .
YO@@ U think you might know something to help the police find them boys ?
I &apos;d say it &apos;s very possible . Right , honey ? It is possible .
We ques@@ tioned Aaron .
He told us about the meetings in the woods .
It made sense to me . I already knew about the Sat@@ anic cul@@ t .
You knew about the cul@@ t ?
We been exp@@ ecting something like this
Ques@@ tioned V@@ ick@@ i .
Ask@@ ed her if there was anything she knew about an oc@@ cul@@ t Or devil wor@@ ship@@ pers .
She said no .
But then she said , &quot; How about I go play det@@ ective
Jes@@ sie !
You &apos;re a real swe@@ e@@ tie to come over here today and do this in this heat .
It &apos;s all right .
Do you know that boy , Dam@@ ien E@@ ch@@ ols ?
About people painted black , ch@@ anting , doing what men and women do .
But did you ever find any evidence to cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ate
Or anything that would link these mur@@ ders to Dam@@ ien ?
No physical evidence . But we got something e se .
We got Jes@@ sie &apos;s con@@ fession .
So V@@ ick@@ i &apos;s plan failed , right ?
Dam@@ ien gave her nothing
Ye@@ ah , but V@@ ick@@ i &apos;s plan got Jes@@ sie involved ,
They got their con@@ fession from him instead .
And J@@ ason Bal@@ d@@ win gets caught in the net just by pic@@ king the wrong friend .
A@@ in &apos;t that what our m@@ amas always war@@ ned us about ?
Are they gon@@ na put Aaron on the stand ?
So the jury &apos;s never gon@@ na hear
Oh , but they did hear from him .
Remember G@@ it@@ ch@@ ell &apos;s ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous manip@@ ulations with the tape rec@@ order ?
&quot; No@@ body knows what happened but me . &quot;
The State sent 600 items to the lab and out of all that they got nothing
Look at this .
Remember how G@@ it@@ ch@@ ell told the press
This police report was signed by Det@@ ective Rid@@ ge
They actually changed our case number to the number of the be@@ ast ?
This is a go@@ d@@ dam@@ n wit@@ ch h@@ unt .
Our boys were never susp@@ ects in this case . They were targets .
And once they set their sights on J@@ ason and Dam@@ ien ,
But we don &apos;t have to . We can keep looking
Wh@@ atever it takes .
If you don &apos;t help those poor boys , who will ?
No@@ body will . No@@ body but you .
Ar@@ ise and be bapti@@ zed .
Wash@@ ing away your sins . C@@ alling on the name of the Lord .
God will never put more on you than you can bear .
U@@ h , none .
nd how were you accepted into en@@ roll@@ ment at Columbia Pacific University ?
I had to fill out , u@@ h , several series of papers .
Did you have to fill out a little fl@@ yer like this ?
&quot; Call toll free for information on how to become a doctor . &quot;
Ye@@ ah , you can send in a request for what you want your degree in .
Did you know this was a correspon@@ dence school ? I didn &apos;t .
Ju@@ dge , the witness has a mail order PhD from a non-@@ acc@@ redi@@ ted school
We object to Dr. Griff@@ is as an expert .
Well , I &apos;m not sure within Ar@@ kan@@ sas you need a degree of any kind
But based on the poly@@ graph results ,
What do you want me to do ? Do you want me to lie to you ?
Ok@@ ay , I &apos;m gon@@ na lie . I killed them .
And all the other bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it .
Are you ar@@ rest@@ ing me ?
Chris , what are you doing here ?
Chris !
Your Hon@@ or , the defense calls Christopher Morgan .
Your Hon@@ or , may we approach ?
Your Hon@@ or , I think they are going to try to cross-@@ examine him
My understanding was that this young man re@@ trac@@ ted his statement .
We want to question Mr. Morgan to suggest
Why would his testimony be relevant ?
Your Hon@@ or ,
I &apos;m not gon@@ na allow you to drag in every possible susp@@ ect
Ju@@ dge Bur@@ nett , don &apos;t you think a con@@ fession suff@@ ices as a ti@@ e-@@ in ?
Your Hon@@ or , they could just talk to any@@ body on the street and they could say ,
This is not just any@@ body off the street .
This was the Oc@@ ean@@ side PD
Ladies and gentlemen , I am going to need to conduct a hearing in camera so
I &apos;m gon@@ na ask you .... .
What ?
... to go back to the jury room .
Ba@@ ili@@ ff , will you clear the cour@@ tro@@ om , please ?
And why aren &apos;t we allowed to hear what he says ?
Bob@@ by De@@ Angel@@ o asked for a picture of my son and
I have a right to hear what he says .
Yes , you do , Mrs. Hob@@ bs . We all do .
On May 17th , 1993 ,
Yes .
And in a vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ ed statement ..
We are going to be all right . Justice is gon@@ na be se@@ wed , and we love you ,
So you said it just to get out ?
Ye@@ ah , after 17 hours I believe any@@ body would .
Now , before you made the statements in question ,
And immediately after that , did you again deny any knowledge
Bur@@ nett wouldn &apos;t let him testi@@ fy .
It was so important to get that k@@ id on the stand
I know .
But the judge says that &apos;s not relevant
Besides , F@@ og@@ lem@@ an says there &apos;s no tape for the part
You can &apos;t see p@@ ant of the tape
I saw it . I wat@@ ched the whole thing
You guys even watch the entire six hours of tape ?
We have a syn@@ op@@ sis from the Oc@@ ean@@ side F@@ D .
A syn@@ op@@ sis ?
Since when do we depend on police reports ?
R@@ on , we did not have enough time or money .
But you should have told Bur@@ nett .
Now , Dam@@ ien , this book on wit@@ ch@@ craft ,
The library had these books they were getting rid of for 10 c@@ ents each .
Dam@@ ien , there &apos;s some pages in there that are under@@ lined in red ,
That was already done when I got it .
I think som@@ ebo@@ dy had a report to do &apos; cause all through the book
Ok@@ ay .
Dam@@ ien , why do you like to wear black ?
I@@ was told I@@ look good in it .
And it he ped me deal with people .
Z@@ ou &apos;ve looked into the Sat@@ anic side of the oc@@ cul@@ t , correct ?
T@@ m familiar with it .
You familiar with Al@@ ei@@ ster Crow@@ ley ?
Based on his writ@@ ings , he believes in human sacrifice , doesn &apos;t he ?
He also believed he was God , so ..
His writ@@ ings indicated that children were the best type of human sacrifice .
Cor@@ rec@@ t ?
Yes , si@@ r .
But Crow@@ ley has no particular significance to you ?
And when you look at all this circum@@ stanti@@ al evidence as a whole ,
Now , all this Sat@@ anic stuff ? It doesn &apos;t matter whether I believe it .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether the defense att@@ or@@ neys believe it .
It doesn &apos;t even matter whether you believe in it .
The only thing that matters is what these def@@ endants believe .
Now , you look at history ,
It gives people who want to do evil the justi@@ fication for what they do .
And when you look at it all together ,
You see inside that person . You look inside ,
The first ver@@ dict reads as follows .
&quot; We , the jury , find Dam@@ ien E@@ ch@@ ols
The angle of this region is very steep .
Exp@@ ect typical comm@@ s problems .
We &apos;re gon@@ na be on two-@@ hour comm@@ s windows .
If we miss two windows ,
If not , don &apos;t swe@@ at it .
Wa@@ y@@ point one is Bud@@ wei@@ ser .
Wa@@ y@@ point two is Miller .
If we &apos;re home by the 15th , me and Morgan
How is that gon@@ na help me ?

Now , that &apos;s not exactly asking too much , is it ?
What if you don &apos;t last another two weeks ?
It was a real drag that I was no longer allowed to use my other gur@@ ney .
The ser@@ -@@ prop@@ elled one .
It h@@ ad-@@ caused a couple of spectacular accidents .
I couldn &apos;t see wher@@ es was going .
Mary &apos;s fear and app@@ reh@@ en@@ sion slowly gave way to pride and purpose .
Elizabeth , pregnant herself with Saint John
It was Elizabeth , and her absolute faith ...
.... that gave Mary the courage she was lacking .
And she gave thanks , saying , my soul d@@ oth mag@@ ni@@ fy the Lord ..
... and my spirit hath re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed in God , my sa@@ vi@@ or .
May the spirit of the Lord be amongst you and remain with you always .
A@@ men .
I &apos;m definitely a true belie@@ ver ,
One who created me in his own image .
Hello . I don &apos;t think we &apos;ve met . I &apos;m Father Br@@ end@@ an .
I &apos;m Mark O &apos;@@ Bri@@ en . I knew Father Se@@ am@@ us very well .
I &apos;m sorry that he &apos;s not here any more .
As are many others . I &apos;ll do my best to fill his shoes .
You &apos;d like me to hear your con@@ fession ? Yes , I would .
I told my atten@@ d@@ ant to come back in half an hour . Is that ok@@ ay ?
That &apos;s good enough for me .
&quot; Am@@ anda . &quot;
Do you have any experience ?
No . N@@ one at all .
That sounds perfect .
So how long can you stay out ?
Three or four hours . Ye@@ ah ?
Dep@@ ends on how much fun I &apos;m having
She took me on a pic@@ nic once With her boy@@ friend and another couple .
And what did the boy@@ friend think ?
That I was in his way ?
I &apos;m always in som@@ ebo@@ dy &apos;s way , I thought
And ?
And what
What do you ... ? Ye@@ ah . I do everything
Do you have other questions ?
Gro@@ ss . What ?
What &apos;d you say ?
Ok@@ ay , look , no need to be def@@ ensive , ok@@ ay ? I &apos;m not exactly threatened by this guy .
Ye@@ ah ? Why not ? God , he &apos;s much more a man than you are .
So , what does your boy@@ friend think of me ?
He &apos;s an as@@ sh@@ ole . Do@@ esn &apos;t matter what he thinks of you .
I &apos;m interested in the opinion of an as@@ sh@@ ole .
First session .
Mark O &apos;@@ Bri@@ en is the oldest of four children ..
and raised Catholic .
He was extremely nervous .
He y@@ elled a lot when I took off his shirt , but I think more out of fear than pain .
He cannot masturb@@ ate , has had only the occasion@@ al k@@ is@@ sing experience .
He &apos;s capable of achieving an er@@ ection easily ,
I just started working with this gent@@ lem@@ an who sp@@ ends almost his entire life .
Som@@ ehow you don &apos;t feel like you &apos;ve done it until you &apos;ve gone all the way in .
I want you to look at me this time .
Come on , give it a try . Open your eyes ,
I do .
So from now on ..
I have a good feeling about today . A very good feeling . Good .
I had a feeling it was never going to happen but I think today &apos;s the day .
Can I make a sugges@@ tion ? Please .
Stop thinking about it .
Cou@@ ldn &apos;t have wish@@ ed for nic@@ er weather .
You &apos;re not listening , are you ? Stop thinking about it .
Beautiful weather I
I &apos;m so sorry . I forgot .
She was very ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tic .
Look , it may not be exactly what we had in mind ..
Of course I can picture him . From the outside .
I mean , as an adult .
As you are now .
Looking at him , with his ...
.. crew cut and his little face .
The fact that I &apos;m already happy does not seem to be relevant .
What does your husband do ?
He &apos;s a philosop@@ her .
Wo@@ w . At a university ?
No . In his own mind .
He runs the house and plays guitar .
He thinks a lot .
It &apos;s getting late .
H@@ ey , we did great today . You were fantastic .
which now has a proven track record .
You should be thri@@ lled .
Was I really inside you ?
You were really and truly inside me .
For how long ? At least five or six seconds .
Is that all ?
That &apos;s a long time for some people .
You were pretty excited . I don &apos;t know what you were thinking about .
It was ... It was all a j@@ um@@ ble of sens@@ ations .
Well , you definitely achieved penetration .
It was pen@@ is-@@ vag@@ ina all the way ... and you definitely get an &quot; A &quot; for orgasm .
Cher@@ yl .
Did you come ?
No , Mark , I didn &apos;t .
Can we try for that next time ?
Is that what you want ?
Oh , si@@ r , I &apos;d wait a couple minutes . That coffee &apos;s kind of hot .
Oh , thanks . You &apos;re welcome .
So , what should we talk about ?
You know , we don &apos;t have to do much talking .
I just wanted to be seen with you in public .
And I want people to say , &quot; H@@ ey , who &apos;s that g@@ im@@ p with that beautiful bl@@ ond ?
How did he get so lucky ? &quot;
As your boy@@ friend ?
As my husband . I mean , why not go all the way ?
Re@@ ally ?
We &apos;@@ ne pre@@ ten@@ ding , right ?
Let me what ?
Re@@ ally ? Re@@ ally , aren &apos;t you the one that &apos;s always said it can &apos;t get personal ?
That &apos;s a whole other thing . What are you doing opening my mail ?
It was sc@@ ented . I assumed it was j@@ unk mail .
Even less reason to open it . Where is it ? Give it to me .
You &apos;re not getting it .
This is none of your business . You &apos;re still not getting it .
I thre@@ w it out .
You didn &apos;t . I fu@@ cking did !
What &apos;s up ?
Would you ask your mother ... to pass the salt , please ?
Cher@@ yl , would you please pass the salt ?
Run@@ ner on first with one out ...
to the lan@@ ky left fiel@@ der . And the pitch .
And he struck him out ! I don &apos;t think he was exp@@ ecting that .
Ye@@ ah , you can do it . Come on .
The person you are calling is not in . Please leave a message .
R@@ od .
I need your help .
The power &apos;s gone out ... including the pump on the iron lung .
I &apos;d say I got about three hours before I start to turn blue .
I hope you get this in time .
It &apos;s Mark . I &apos;ll try 9@@ 11 .
Sh@@ it
Mark .
Can you open your eyes for me , Mark ? Can you hear me ?
Mark ?
Come on , Mark .
They &apos;ll be let@@ ting you go today .

You &apos;ll have at least one backup system .
Ok@@ ay ? Ok@@ ay
To what ?
You know , to the ... That tunnel thing and the
No , I assume I passed out .
Before that , I remember feeling sorry for myself .
Do you feel relie@@ ved now ? No .
I can recommend you to someone , if you like .
I &apos;m . I &apos;m sorry to be ru@@ de .
could do anything useful for me right now .
My priest couldn &apos;t .
Are you religious ?
Yes . I would find it absolutely int@@ oler@@ able
Are you ?
No . I don &apos;t ... I don &apos;t go to any church or ..
I don &apos;t think about God very much .
I do believe there &apos;s a .
Ye@@ ah , I have to call in sick , guys .
No . No@@ body &apos;s calling in sick .
It &apos;s a beautiful day . You &apos;re gon@@ na get dres@@ sed .
We &apos;re all gon@@ na walk to work .
Come on .
Let &apos;s go , guys . Come on .

No call . You didn &apos;t tell me .
I need you to leave . I &apos;m ..
What do you think , De@@ ja ?
I &apos;ll go . If that &apos;s what you want , I &apos;ll go .
Yes , I want you to go , Kurt .
All right , I &apos;ll go . I &apos;ll go .
His name is Kurt .
And he &apos;s a dick .
You got I got you .
I got your back . I got your back .
I &apos;m not gon@@ na let nothing happen to you .

I know , I know .
But you got@@ ta em@@ bra@@ ce that pain , Mark .
You got@@ ta love the pain .
Love the pain .
Does she have a Co@@ w ?
G@@ ot caught in the cross@@ fire . Cow@@ -@@ lat@@ eral damage .
But what &apos;s her story ?
Ye@@ ah . Can she handle a rod ?
No , but she can handle a te@@ at , that &apos;s for sure .
I felt bad about the TV yesterday .
You seemed pretty fre@@ aked out .
You taking your me@@ ds ?
Good .
So , are you gon@@ na go to the sent@@ encing ?
I doubt it .
I &apos;ll go with you , if you want .
It &apos;s important . You need to go .
So those jer@@ ks get what they des@@ erve .
You can &apos;t let them get off lightly .
Oh , this guy just went from Tom Cru@@ ise
In the end , what I learned
My br@@ ushes are mine .
My stro@@ kes are mine .
Gu@@ ess what &apos;s not getting stro@@ ked ton@@ ight .
Old Adam &apos;s pain@@ t@@ brush .
That &apos;s got to be sar@@ c@@ astic appl@@ au@@ ding , right ?
Thank you , Adam August .
That is the end of our show .
I &apos;d like to thank all of our perform@@ ers .
You live the stories that we live to hear .
I know , that was pretty real .
It was real long .
So where are we going for dinner ?
Your treat , and she &apos;s coming .
Actually , I &apos;m pretty spent emo@@ tionally .
Well , we &apos;re spent fort@@ y-@@ d@@ oll@@ ar@@ s-@@ ally .
Well , we &apos;re spent fort@@ y-@@ d@@ oll@@ ar@@ s-@@ ally .
you leave it all on the stage .
Carol@@ ine has a rough story .
Again , we can &apos;t compare our tru@@ ths .
I &apos;m sorry , but did all that really happen to you ?
You lost billi@@ ons ?
Five years ago today , in fact .
And with what I lost ton@@ ight , $ 5 billion , $ 40 .
Well , have you ever considered
You &apos;re still here ?
Thanks for the offer , but I &apos;m not really a writer .
Or a person who would come here twice .
Plus , I &apos;m trying to put my story behind me .
All right . Well , think about it .
It pays $ 50 . Here &apos;s my card .
You work at Avis ?
That &apos;s my other job .
And remember , you have a story to tell .
And sometimes renting a car is actually cheaper
I think you should totally do this .
To finally tell my story and give it closure ?
Ye@@ ah , a little of that , but mostly the 50 bu@@ cks .
I &apos;m here for the surro@@ g@@ acy interview .
Max , we got another baby m@@ ama .
Look at all these woman trying to get pregnant .
Will any of them wait tables ?
H@@ an , can I go work in your office ?
l just need to write my life story .
I promise I won &apos;t play with your Leg@@ os .
You mean those little plastic men
Wo@@ w . You &apos;re one to talk about truth .
I understand .
I mean , men prefer to think in grand gest@@ ures .
You need some drama to fall in love , isn &apos;t it , Br@@ yan ? H@@ mm ?
He still did that .
He just saved it to the third date .
Hu@@ h . How ?

I want Sco@@ field &apos;s and Bur@@ rows &apos; pictures on each and every gas pump .
Sco@@ field included him in the escape .
Who knows what he knows ?
Sco@@ field and Bur@@ rows are still out there .

They can push through the quick@@ est hab@@ eas

It was so powerful , in fact .

This is just one of the 1.3 million earthqu@@ akes ..

There aren &apos;t any faul@@ ts out there .
Any known faul@@ ts . Now , if we get there while the mini qu@@ akes continue
And if the magnetic pul@@ se rate goes up before the qu@@ akes .
Then we &apos;re predic@@ ting them . Then we are predic@@ ting them .
All right .
Let &apos;s go check it out .
Hi , D@@ ad . H@@ ey , swe@@ e@@ tie .
I was wondering if there was room for my bike .
Th@@ ought that I could ride it to class , then I wouldn &apos;t have to buy a parking pass .
That &apos;s a great idea . I &apos;m sure I could figure out a way to fit it in .
All right , great . I can &apos;t find the key to the lock at M@@ om &apos;s ..
Off@@ ici@@ als are saying that Hoo@@ ver D@@ am is a total loss .
Lake Hav@@ as@@ u City , Ne@@ ed@@ les , Bl@@ y@@ the and Lau@@ gh@@ lin also suffered major damage .
Additional support from Los Angeles , including L.@@ A.@@ F.@@ D. air rescue ..
is expected to begin arriving in the next 24 hours .
Hi , D@@ ad
I know . I &apos;m so sorry . We &apos;re heading out tomorrow .
No , I get it . This one &apos;s really bad , D@@ ad .
Ye@@ ah , this one &apos;s tough .
What time we heading out ?
14 : 30 . Gu@@ ys are pre@@ pping the gear now .
All right . Let &apos;s get to work .
It &apos;s a fairly sophisticated rescue operation under@@ way .
So this Daniel guy &apos;s taking B@@ lake now ?
I would have just called in sick .
It &apos;s why I &apos;m the b@@ oss and you &apos;re not .
Pre@@ t@@ ty sure we can manage a few days without ya .
Shoe &apos;s un@@ tied
B@@ lake
Oh , I did . This is one of them right here .
She &apos;s a nice addition to the San Francisco sky@@ line , don &apos;t you think ?
The G@@ ate@@ &apos;
Ye@@ ah , I like it .
it &apos;s the t@@ allest building in the city , right ?
When it &apos;s finished , it &apos;ll be the t@@ allest , stron@@ gest .
and it &apos;s already 80 percent sold .
But hon@@ est@@ ly ..
I W@@ ish .
I &apos;m inter@@ viewing for a job here ..
and Mr. Rid@@ dick is the b@@ oss of the b@@ oss
So , what kind of job are you inter@@ viewing for ?
Any@@ thing in engineering or design . I &apos;m not pick@@ y or proud .
I just want to work here
Hi . I &apos;m Ol@@ lie . He &apos;s my brother .
Hi . It &apos;s nice to meet you , Ol@@ lie . I &apos;m B@@ lake .
You know , you &apos;re quite beautiful .
We &apos;re gon@@ na head straight over . Excellent .
What do you want to talk about ?
Where you from ? England .
Ben thought while our parents were gon@@ na be on a cruise .
he and I should take a holiday here in the city , after his interview .
A@@ wesome . Oh .
Would you like to hear our itiner@@ ary ?
Sus@@ an . It &apos;s nice to finally meet you .
Am I interrup@@ ting anything ?
Nothing important . What &apos;s going on ?
Look , I just wanted to tell you I was sorry for how I acted yesterday .
No , Ray , really .
No , Emma .
I just wasn &apos;t ready to hear about you and B@@ lake moving in with someone else .
I should &apos;ve told you before .
H@@ ey , how &apos;s B@@ lake feel about it ? You know .
She &apos;d like us to be a family again .
I think it &apos;s gon@@ na be hard for her to ..
Emma .
Oh , my God . We &apos;re having an earthquake .
Oh , Jesus , Ray . I got@@ ta get ou@@ tt@@ a here .
Dro@@ p , cover and hold on !
La@@ wr@@ ence , the Richter just j@@ ump@@ ed from a 6.5 to an 8.5 .
What does that mean ?
Po@@ wers of ten !
So it &apos;s a hundred times stronger now !
Don &apos;t worry . Cal@@ tech is probably the saf@@ est place to be right now .
Professor ! It looks like the whole San Andreas fault line is being activated .
And it &apos;s heading toward San Francisco .
All right . All done .
Ok@@ ay .
Well , it was really nice to meet you , Ol@@ lie . I hope you have fun while you &apos;re here .
B@@ ye , B@@ lake . It was nice meeting you , as well .
Good b@@ ye .
Oh , and , um ...
I almost forgot . Do you mind if I bor@@ row your book for a second ?
Tell Ben that I &apos;ll put in a good word for him .
B@@ ye . B@@ ye .
I can &apos; wait to be 20
Ye@@ ah , ok@@ ay .
And here are the pul@@ se rates now .
The same . Or higher .
So the earthquake didn &apos;t dimin@@ ish them .
Oh , man .
Oh , this is not good .
station still up along the fault line .
And get it for me now . Right .
What &apos;s going on ? This is not over .
Sh@@ it .
Oh , man . This thing &apos;s fried .
Come on . I need everybody .
What are we doing ? Get@@ ting you on the air . To war@@ n people
Ok@@ ay , who wants an &quot; A &quot; in independent study ? I &apos;m starting a new class :
Sweet . Get your laptop . Let &apos;s go .
Right here . Mo@@ ve , move , move .
Here we go . Up . Lift .
Let &apos;s go ! Over here .
It should be just up ahead .
There it is
So we have to find a rot@@ ary or a push@@ -@@ button phone .
How do you know all this ?
My dad .
That tall c@@ ement no@@ zzle thing on the hill . Ex@@ ac@@ tly .
Don &apos;t stop anywhere . Go there . That &apos;s where we &apos;ll meet .
Stay strong , honey .
We &apos;re coming to get you . Ok@@ ay .
Wa@@ it , M@@ om . How are you and D@@ ad together ?
We &apos;ll explain later . Ok@@ ay , honey ? I love you .
I love you guys .
B@@ ye .
Hello , Chris .
Director for Ear@@ th@@ qu@@ ake Studies at Cal@@ tech .
He and his research partner , Dr. Kim Park
They knew L.@@ A. was going to get hit .
But nobody listen@@ ed to them .
J@@ t &apos;s time now to listen .
Go ahead , doctor . Ok@@ ay .
Basi@@ cally , California &apos;s entire t@@ ec@@ ton@@ ic plate has shi@@ fted .
damage all the way up in San Francisco .
from movement along the fault line .
in the Central Valley .
Their end of the fault line has not moved yet .
More import@@ antly , people need to know that the sha@@ king is not over .
And it &apos;s not after@@ sho@@ cks I &apos;m talking about .
San Francisco will get hit again .
And it &apos;s going to be a bigger monster this time .
Our models are predic@@ ting a 9.@@ 5 or greater .
It will be so big that , even though it &apos;s happening here in California .
you will feel it on the East Coast .
Now , I cannot empha@@ size this enough to the people of San Francisco :
And , if you can &apos;t , you need to find any means possible ...
I never bl@@ amed you . I don &apos;t w@@ anna talk about it .
II doesn &apos;t matter .
She &apos;s gone . Now you &apos;re gone ..
What &apos;s the point ?
I gu@@ ess the point is .
The moment she realized
And then coming home every day to you and B@@ lake only made it harder .
Because nothing was the way it used to be . And the way it used to be was .
It was perfect .
I should &apos;ve let you in .
I just didn &apos;t know how .
I &apos;m so sorry for how things ended with us , E@@ m .
I really am .
If you couldn &apos;t save our daughter ...
then nobody could have
Let &apos;s go get our daughter .
Let &apos;s go ! Keep it moving ! Let &apos;s go !
which leads to Co@@ it Tower .
Do you mind if I ask why you wear two of the same neckl@@ aces ?
One of them used to be my sister &apos;s .
I started wearing it after she died .
We had given them to each other for Christmas the year before .
I &apos;m so sorry . I didn &apos;t mean ... No . It &apos;s ok@@ ay
H@@ ey . Check it out .
What are you doing ?
They should have a supply box . It &apos;ll have stuff that we can use .
T@@ s this it
Oh , ok@@ ay .
Here we go .
Every city has a tac@@ tical channel
We can listen in , we can see what &apos;s going on .
Ok@@ ay .
San Francisco has begun ev@@ acu@@ ation .
The Coast Guard is asking anyone with access to a boat to please volunte@@ er .
.. the fault line in the Central Valley .
Their end of the fault line has not moved yet .
San Francisco is going to get hit again , and this will be a much bigger monster .
I hope we &apos;ve given everyone enough warning .
This is it , isn &apos;t it ?
Right now , I w@@ anna be so wrong
This will be over soon here .
But pray for the people of San Francisco .
Did you know &quot; No@@ b &quot; is a s@@ lang term ..
. &quot; which means &apos; rich or weal@@ thy . &apos; 
Lar@@ gest qu@@ ake in recorded history .
Oh , no .
Co@@ it &apos;s been burning a while . She &apos;s gone some@@ place else .
Now , where are you , baby ? Where are you ?
What &apos;s your Plan B ?
Oh , sh@@ it .
What &apos;s happening ?
We got@@ ta go . Water being pulled out like that &apos;s a ts@@ un@@ ami .
We got@@ ta get ou@@ tt@@ a the bay , now .
Wa@@ it . Wa@@ it , wait a second . Just give me one second .
Ye@@ ah . There &apos;s too much ble@@ eding .
He &apos;s not gon@@ na make it if we keep going .
Let &apos;s pack him and get him up to I.@@ C.@@ U .
to stabili@@ ze him .
I am not bab@@ ys@@ itting .
I have made your career ,
I need to check for a sep@@ tal hem@@ at@@ oma .
All right , fine .
P@@ ush the reservation to 9 : 00 .
Why are you still here ? You can go .
I &apos;d love to . I &apos;d love nothing more .
But N@@ ico won &apos;t leave until he knows C@@ lem &apos;s gon@@ na be ok@@ ay .
He &apos;s 10 . Who &apos;s the parent here ?
You let that k@@ id run wild .
At least I don &apos;t ho@@ ver over him ,
Well , maybe I need to ho@@ ver
What were you thinking , dro@@ pping him
He wasn &apos;t gon@@ na stay .
He just wanted to give your spo@@ iled daughter
Well , stop giving us things .
We bar@@ ely survived the head li@@ ce he gave her .
You have no way of knowing who gave who the head li@@ ce .
Ok@@ ay , that &apos;s enough .
They &apos;re 10 . They &apos;re in love . They &apos;re cute .
Let them be cute , for cr@@ ying out loud .
Exc@@ use me , doctor , something &apos;s wrong with C@@ lem .
She &apos;s breathing funny .
E@@ ver thought you &apos;d be wish@@ ing so hard
No ! No ! No !
Hon@@ ey , we &apos;re leaving now .
No , I &apos;m not ! I promised C@@ lem I &apos;d stay with her !
N@@ ico , don &apos;t make me pick you up .
You &apos;re too big for this .
This is embar@@ rass@@ ing , you know ?
I &apos;m a little embar@@ rass@@ ed for you .
I don &apos;t care .
What &apos;s C@@ lem gon@@ na think if she w@@ akes up and I &apos;m gone ?
She &apos;ll think that I don &apos;t love her .
U@@ h .. look , u@@ h ...
What if I &apos;m there when she w@@ akes up ?
I &apos;ll tell her whatever you want .
It &apos;s like the next best thing to being there .
Pro@@ mis@@ e ?
Ye@@ ah .
You &apos;re gon@@ na need a pen and a pad of paper .
Oh , good . U@@ h , all right . Here we go .
Path@@ ology &apos;s back .
The ov@@ ary spec@@ im@@ en you sent is normal .
No path@@ ology seen .
Dam@@ n . We picked the wrong ov@@ ary .
There &apos;s a chance the other one &apos;s clean , too .
You don &apos;t have a very good personality , you know that ?
c@@ d@@ l@@ ple@@ dge myself to thee forever .
nd ple@@ dge myself to thee forever .
Love me tender
for making me feel so at home .
I &apos;ve never really felt like I was part of a family before .
So , thank you for being so welcoming and wonderful .
D@@ ad had the first camera .
He &apos;d carry it on his shoulder like this .
I wanted you to know that I think you are a wonderful brother .
I &apos;m being serious ! This is a beautiful event ..
and I &apos;m really grateful that you invited me .
We were in the same fo@@ ster home together for a year .
And we were more than friends . Family
So , here &apos;s to happ@@ ily ever after .
Oh , gos@@ h .
M@@ mm .
Are you ok@@ ay ?
Sam .
my beautiful wife .
This was the most perfect day .
Oh , sh@@ it . I &apos;m stuck .
How did we get home last night ?
I don &apos;t know . The guy in the c@@ ab ?
Stop . Not right now .
See you later , Santo I@@ Dom@@ ingo .
T@@ ilt your head back .
This is where you &apos;ll go to school .
I got beat up here a couple times , but that &apos;s not gon@@ na happen to you .
You &apos;re gon@@ na be a much cool@@ er k@@ id .
Ah , this is where me and your mo@@ m got married .
Very pretty church .
This is where we walk the dog .
Here &apos;s the Anderson house . It still looks like sh@@ it .
Sh@@ it , fu@@ ck . Ma@@ ver@@ ick !
Ma@@ ver@@ ick , God dam@@ n .
H@@ ey , h@@ ey . Ma@@ ver@@ ick !
Come here . H@@ ey , no , no .
No , no , we don &apos;t live here . Come on .
U@@ gh . It was fine . I just had to leave because I &apos;m star@@ ving
I know , I don &apos;t want that .
Ok@@ ay .
IT &apos;m just gon@@ na eat a b@@ unch of cookies .
How are you feeling ?
I &apos;m just hung@@ ry .
All right . Who@@ o ! Get ready .
No , seriously , Sam . Please , just wait there .
I &apos;ll be right there . Who@@ a . Who@@ a ! Who@@ a !
Oh , sh@@ it ! Sam !
Mo@@ ther@@ fu@@ cker !
What are you doing ? Are you fu@@ cking crazy ?
Get away from my car !
Stop , stop !
It &apos;s ok@@ ay . It &apos;s ok@@ ay .
We &apos;re gon@@ na get some help . We &apos;re gon@@ na get some help .
You know , we talked about the summer courses .
So , I figured I &apos;d just get a couple of classes going ...
and then go back to the full load in the fall .
You don &apos;t want to just wait until the fall ?
No , I don &apos;t want to just wait until the fall .
Ok@@ ay , I was just thinking because ..
I know , it &apos;s just that this has come up and I ...
No , I know . But the baby is coming in March .
I know it &apos;s not gon@@ na be easy . But I don &apos;t want to put everything on hold just to ..
We &apos;re not putting everything on hold in@@ definitely .
I got@@ ta keep working .
But if I stop doing it now ...
then I feel like I &apos;m not gon@@ na be able to start back up again .
I &apos;m gon@@ na be stuck in this house
Then I &apos;m gon@@ na turn into your sister .
I &apos;m gon@@ na be N@@ atal@@ ie , and I don &apos;t want to be her .
Sam , you &apos;re not gon@@ na be N@@ atal@@ ie . It &apos;s you and me .
That &apos;s what it &apos;s turning into . I know that ..
but this isn &apos;t what I wanted to begin with , ok@@ ay ?
I don &apos;t want to bo@@ ther Sam .
Ok@@ ay .
How did we get home last night ?
I don &apos;t know . The guy in the c@@ ab ?
What the fu@@ ck ?
He was like our c@@ ab driver , on our hon@@ ey@@ moon .
So I came home , looked at all the tap@@ es , and there &apos;s all this mystery fu@@ cking ...
Look at this .
ou sure , man ? Maybe it &apos;s some wei@@ rd sh@@ it they do down there to sc@@ are tourists .
Who@@ a , what the fu@@ ck ?
What the fu@@ ck ?
It &apos;s gone .
What are you talking about ?
T@@ I was literally just looking at this sh@@ it right before you
It &apos;s empty . It &apos;s gone . The fu@@ cking tape is gone now .
Fu@@ ck !
e everything I &apos;ve seen says they &apos;re , u@@ h , religious symbols .
because everything I &apos;ve seen says they &apos;re , u@@ h , religious symbols .
So , u@@ h , there &apos;s these ones ..
and then there &apos;s that .
There &apos;s a b@@ unch more .
These are the only ones I &apos;ve actually seen in person .
What ?
First John , 2 : 18 .
&quot; And children , this is the last hour . &quot;
These are from early , early religion . These are
They tried to bring the church down in its early days .
We &apos;ve caused the displac@@ ement of thousands of families into refugee camps .
These families are suffering from star@@ v@@ ation due to over@@ crow@@ ding .
The question we &apos;ve got to ask ourselves is ...
When will the bloo@@ d@@ shed come to an end ?
I wasn &apos;t exp@@ ecting you to come all the way out here .
I came so you could explain to me in person why , in the middle of a war ...
Are you still ch@@ asing space rocks ?
I &apos;m sure you can understand why we haven &apos;t been able to leave .
The data is unden@@ i@@ able .
You were ordered to shut down .
I Can &apos;t .. not yet . We &apos;re too close .
You were army intelligence before you joined us ..
Is that you don &apos;t have to wait to the commercial to p@@ iss .
You don &apos;t want to go back .
See pain , I can deal with that .
It &apos;s the in@@ activity that su@@ cks .
World &apos;s going to hell anyway . We &apos;re just re@@ ap@@ ing what we &apos;ve s@@ own .
$ 40 . That all ?
Well , it &apos;s something .
One minute it &apos;s a job , next he &apos;s got his cock in your mouth .
Mak@@ es sense to me . What else are we good for ?
They think you &apos;ll charge half the price for just one kne@@ e pad ?
Why don &apos;t you put that in your letter ? H@@ m ?
What &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
Ok@@ ay . You ready to do this ?
For all the good it &apos;s gon@@ na do .
We don &apos;t want your fasc@@ ist war ! We don &apos;t need your draft no more !
We don &apos;t we want your fasc@@ ist war !
We don &apos;t we need your draft no more !
All right , all right , come on , people . Let &apos;s wra@@ p this up .
We don &apos;t we want your fasc@@ ist war !
We don &apos;t we need .. what the ...
Come on .
H@@ ey , si@@ r ? H@@ ey , you look like a smart guy .
Sign this and you won &apos;t have to worry about your kids getting blow@@ n up .
Then go back to killing children again .
Ram@@ on , you ok@@ ay ?
Ex@@ plain why some as@@ sh@@ ol@@ es are moving my scra@@ p .
And a truck that only you have the keys to . What ?
This some kind of inside job ?
Inside job ? I don &apos;t know sh@@ it about this .
No ? It sure looks like your boy Cham@@ ber@@ la@@ in to me .
Dave .
Ron@@ an ,
Only then will he destroy X@@ and@@ ar for me .
Neb@@ ula , go to X@@ and@@ ar and get me the Or@@ b .
It will be my honor .
It will be your d@@ oom .
If this happens again , you &apos;ll be facing our father
I &apos;m a daughter of Th@@ an@@ os .
Just like you .
What a b@@ unch Of los@@ ers .
All of them in a big hur@@ ry to get from something st@@ up@@ id ,
Look at this guy !
Can you believe they call us crimin@@ als ,
What is this thing ? Look how it thinks it &apos;s so cool
W@@ an@@ ted to be here . S@@ ends his love .
And told me to tell you ,
What is it ?
It &apos;s my policy never to discuss my clients , or their needs .
Ye@@ ah , well , I almost died getting it for you .
An occup@@ ational haz@@ ard , I &apos;m sure , in your line of work .
Some mach@@ ine-@@ headed fre@@ ak , working for a du@@ de named Ron@@ an .
Ron@@ an ? I &apos;m sorry , Mr. Qu@@ ill .
I truly am .
But I want no part of this transaction if Ron@@ an is involved .
Who &apos;s Ron@@ an ?
A K@@ ree fan@@ atic , ou@@ tra@@ ged by the peace treaty ,
What ? What about my bad side ?
F@@ are@@ well , Mr. Qu@@ ill .
H@@ ey , we had a deal , Br@@ o !
What happened ?
This guy just back@@ ed out of a deal on me .
If there &apos;s one thing I hate , it &apos;s a man without integrity .
Peter Qu@@ ill . People call me Star@@ -@@ Lord .
You have the bearing of a man of honor .
Well , you know , I wouldn &apos;t say that .
People say it about me , all the time ,
Qu@@ it sm@@ iling , you idi@@ ot . You &apos;re supposed to be a professional .
You got@@ ta be kid@@ ding me .
H@@ ey !
I live for the simple things .
Like how much this is gon@@ na hurt .
Ra@@ ised from youth by a band of mer@@ cen@@ aries called the Rav@@ agers ,
I &apos;m sorry .
I didn &apos;t know how this machine worked .
What a b@@ unch of a-@@ holes .
Transport all four to the K@@ y n .
I gu@@ ess most of Nova Corps w@@ anna uph@@ old the laws ,
I ain &apos;t gon@@ na be here long
I &apos;ve had a lot of fol@@ ks try to kill me over the years .
I ain &apos;t about to be brought down by a tree and a talking rac@@ co@@ on .
H@@ old
It &apos;s what you are , st@@ up@@ id .
A@@ in &apos;t no thing like me , except me .
So , this Or@@ b has a real sh@@ iny blue su@@ it@@ case ,
Z@@ oul &apos;re sc@@ um ! You &apos;re sc@@ um !
It &apos;s like I said
A lot of prisoners here have lost their families
She &apos;ll last a day , tops .
Mur@@ derer !
The guards will protect her , right ?
They &apos;re here to stop u@@ S from getting out .
They don &apos;t care what we do to each other inside .
Wh@@ atever night@@ mar@@ es the future holds ,
Check out the new meat .
Her life
He killed my family .
I sh@@ a &apos; kill one of his in return .
Of course , Dra@@ x . Here , I .
Qu@@ ill ! What are you doing ?
I &apos;m no family to Ron@@ an or Th@@ an@@ os .
I &apos;m your only hope at st@@ opping him .
Woman , your words mean nothing to me !
H@@ ey ! H@@ ey , h@@ ey , h@@ ey ! H@@ ey !
Cra@@ p .
You know , if killing Ron@@ an is truly your sole purpose ,
Are you not the man this wen@@ ch attempted to kill ?
Well , I mean , she &apos;s hardly the first woman to try and do that to me .
Look , this is from a smo@@ k@@ ing-@@ hot Raj@@ ak girl .
No , it &apos;s a symbol .
This is a symbol for you s@@ lic@@ ing his thro@@ at .
would not sli@@ ce his thro@@ at .
would cut his head clean Off
You &apos;ve heard of this . You &apos;ve seen this , right ?
As@@ le@@ ep for the danger , aw@@ ake for the money ,
You have been betra@@ yed , Ron@@ an .
We know only that she has been captured .
Gam@@ ora may yet recover the Or@@ b .
No ! Our sources within the K@@ yl@@ n say Gam@@ ora has her own plans for the Or@@ b .
Then she was app@@ reh@@ ended by the Nova Corps .
You are the one here with nothing to show for it .
Your sources say that she meant to betra@@ y us the whole time !
Lower your tone !
I may be your ..
I only ask that you take this matter seriously .
The only matter I do not take seriously , boy ,
Your politics b@@ ore me .
And , apparently , you ali@@ en@@ ated my favorite daughter , Gam@@ ora .
I shall honor our agreement , K@@ ree ,
But return to me again emp@@ ty-@@ handed ,
Thanks , D@@ ad . So@@ unds fair .
This is one fight you won &apos;t win .
Let &apos;s head to the K@@ yl@@ n .
If we &apos;re gon@@ na get out of here ,
And to do that , I &apos;m gon@@ na need a few things .
The guards wear security bands
Man who has ain with an A &apos;@@ ask@@ av@@ ari@@ ian !
T@@ t was one time , man .
We need all available guards in full combat gear ...
Sp@@ are me your f@@ oul ga@@ ze , woman .
Why is this one here ?
We promised him he could stay by your side until he k@@ ills your b@@ oss .
I always keep my promises ,
I was just kid@@ ding about the leg .
I just need these two things .
What ?
No , I thought it &apos;d be funny .
Was it funny ?
Wa@@ it , what did he look like h@@ opping around ?
I had to transfer him 30@@ ,000 units !
How are we going to leave ?
Well , he &apos;s got a plan .
Right ? Or is that another thing you made up ?
I have a plan ! I have a plan !
Sh@@ ut up .
H@@ ey !
What is that ?
That &apos;s for if things get really hard@@ core .
Or if you w@@ anna b@@ low up mo@@ ons .
No one &apos;s b@@ lowing up mo@@ ons .
You just w@@ anna su@@ ck the joy out of everything .
So , listen , I &apos;m gon@@ na need your buyer &apos;s coordinates .
We &apos;re heading in the right direction . For now .
If we &apos;re gon@@ na work together , you might try tru@@ sting me a little bit .
And how much do you trust me ?
I &apos;d trust you a lot more if you told me what this was .
Because I &apos;m gu@@ essing it &apos;s some kind of weapon .
I don &apos;t know what it is .
If it &apos;s a weapon , we should use it against Ron@@ an .
I let you live once , pr@@ inc@@ ess !
I am not a pr@@ inc@@ ess !
H@@ ey !
No@@ body is killing any@@ body on my ship !
We &apos;re stuck together until we get the money .
I have no interest in money .
Great .
That means more money for the three of us .
And Qu@@ ill , your ship is fil@@ thy .
She has no idea .
If I had a black light ,
I swe@@ ar . I don &apos;t know where they went ! I swe@@ ar .
If he knew where they were headed ,
Ye@@ ah
Well , then ,
And this place ?
The Nova can &apos;t know what we &apos;re after .
Clean@@ se it !
Do you got any other cute little bu@@ gg@@ ers like this one ?
I like to stick &apos; em all in a row on my control console .
I can &apos;t tell if you &apos;re jo@@ king or not .
In that case , I can show you .
But first , you gon@@ na tell me what this Or@@ b is ,
And then you gon@@ na tell me ,
Sir , the high-@@ end community is a .
The high-@@ end community is a .
It &apos;s a tigh@@ t-@@ kn@@ it .
T@@ igh@@ t-@@ kn@@ it .
The high-@@ end community is a very tigh@@ t-@@ kn@@ it
Now , who again is this buyer of yours ?
Car@@ ina
Your people do have el@@ b@@ ows , do they not ?
We do , Master .
Then use them .
I don &apos;t have to remind you
Do T
He@@ ads up ! We &apos;re in@@ bound .

H@@ und@@ reds of years ago , the Ti@@ van Group sent workers in
B@@ one , brain tissue , sp@@ inal fluid .
All rare resources , highly valu@@ ed in black markets across the galax@@ y .
It &apos;s dangerous and illegal work , suitable only for out@@ laws .
Well , I come from a planet of out@@ laws .
Bil@@ ly the K@@ id ,
It sounds like a place , which I would like to visit .
Ye@@ ah , you should .
Watch your wall@@ ets .
Can you spare any units ?
Get out of here
We are to wait here for his representative .
Get out of here !
This is no resp@@ ec@@ table establishment .
What do you expect us to do while we wait ?
My Or@@ lon@@ i has won ,
Now , let &apos;s put more of this liquid into our bodies .
That &apos;s the first thing you said that wasn &apos;t b@@ at-@@ sh@@ it crazy !
Man , you wouldn &apos;t believe what they charge for fuel out here .
I might actually lose money on this job .
My connection is making us wait .
It &apos;s just a negoti@@ ation tac@@ tic . Trust me , this is my speci@@ alty .
Where yours is more ,
He tor@@ tured me
When he said he was going to destroy an entire planet for Ron@@ an ,
My mother gave it to me .
My mo@@ m liked sharing with me all the pop songs that she loved growing up .
I happened to have it on me ,
The day that she
What do you do with it ?
Do ? Nothing . You listen to it . Or you can dance .
I &apos;m a war@@ ri@@ or and an ass@@ ass@@ in . I do not dance .
Re@@ ally ?
On my planet , there &apos;s a legend about people like you .
Fon@@ an , it is done
Her body mo@@ ds should keep her alive a couple more minutes ,
These po@@ ds aren &apos;t meant to be out here .
In a second , we &apos;re gon@@ na be in the same boat .
A@@ w , dam@@ n it .
What happened ?
I saw you out there .
I don &apos;t know what came over me .
But I couldn &apos;t let you die .
I found something inside of myself

Qu@@ ill Just got himself captured .
N@@ one of this ever would have happened if you didn &apos;t try to single-@@ han@@ de@@ dly
You &apos;re right .
was a f@@ ool
Captain , the shot was non-@@ dam@@ aging
The lun@@ atic on top of this craft is holding a Had@@ ron En@@ forc@@ er .
It &apos;s a weapon of my own design .
What the hell ?
If you don &apos;t hand over our compan@@ ions now ,
A very big new one !
No ! Wa@@ it , hold on !
Ro@@ cket , it &apos;s me , for God s@@ akes !
We figured it out ! We &apos;re fine !
H@@ ey , Qu@@ ill . What &apos;s going on ?
You call that &quot; figured it out &quot; ?
We &apos;re gon@@ na ro@@ b the guys who just beat us sen@@ sel@@ ess .
You want to talk about sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
How about trying to save us by b@@ lowing us up ?
We were only gon@@ na b@@ low you up if they didn &apos;t turn you over !
And how on earth were they gon@@ na turn us over
We didn &apos;t have time to work out the min@@ uti@@ ae
Secondly , I don &apos;t even believe you have a plan .
I have part of a plan !
What percentage of a plan do you have ?
You don &apos;t get to ask questions
I just saved Qu@@ ill .
We &apos;ve already established
When did we establish it ?
Like three seconds ago !
I wasn &apos;t listening . I was thinking of something else .
She &apos;s right . You don &apos;t get an opinion .
What percentage ?
I don &apos;t know . T@@ wel@@ ve percent .
T@@ wel@@ ve percent ?
That &apos;s a f@@ ake lau@@ gh .
That is the most real , authentic , h@@ yst@@ er@@ ical lau@@ gh of my entire life
It &apos;s bar@@ ely a concept .
You &apos;re taking their side ?
I am Gro@@ ot .
So what , it &apos;s better than 11
Thank you , Gro@@ ot . Thank you .
See ? Gro@@ ot &apos;s the only one of you who has a clu@@ e .
Gu@@ ys .
Come on .
Y@@ on@@ du is gon@@ na be here in two seconds .
He expects to hear this big plan of ours .
I need your help .
T look around at us .
Z@@ ou know what I see ?
Not run away .
I , for one , am not gon@@ na stand by and watch
But , Qu@@ ill , st@@ opping Ron@@ an ,
You &apos;re asking us to die .
Ye@@ ah , I gu@@ ess I am .
Qu@@ ill .
I have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies .
I will be grateful to die among my friends .
You are an hon@@ orable man , Qu@@ ill .
I will fight beside you .
And in the end ,
I am Gro@@ ot .
What the hell . I don &apos;t got that long a li@@ fes@@ pan , anyway .
Now I &apos;m standing . Y &apos;@@ all happy ?
We &apos;re all standing up now .
The Stone re@@ acts to anything organic .
The bigger the target , the bigger the power sur@@ ge .
All Ron@@ an &apos;s got to do is touch the Stone to the planet &apos;s surface and z@@ ap .
All plants , animals ,
Everything will die .
So Ron@@ an does not make the surface .
Bo@@ ck@@ x@@ et will lead a team to b@@ low a hole
Then , our craft and Y@@ on@@ du &apos;s will enter .
W@@ on &apos;t there be hundreds of Sak@@ a@@ ar@@ an soldiers inside ?
I think of Sak@@ a@@ ar@@ an as paper people .
Once they know we &apos;re on board ,
Which I can dis@@ able by dis@@ man@@ t@@ ling the power source .
We &apos;ll make it to the flight deck ,
There are too many of them , Roc@@ x@@ et !
We &apos;ll never make it up there !

For the record , I advised against tru@@ sting you here .
They got my &quot; dick &quot; message !
He said &quot; she &apos;s got a gun in my mouth . &quot;
I &apos;ll trade you this piece of sh@@ it for my diam@@ onds .
Otherwise , his head whi@@ st@@ les
So I will give you your diam@@ onds as you &apos;re

You &apos;re going to look just like me .
H@@ ey , Penn@@ y , it &apos;s me .
Now , listen , here &apos;s the plan .
I have right here in my hand what it is you want .
But if you want it , you &apos;re gon@@ na have to come and get it .
Is@@ n &apos;t it time we were properly introduced ?
You know , face to face ?
Is this face to face enough for you ?
Oh , you do continue to del@@ ight and am@@ a@@ ze .
And you &apos;re really , really starting to p@@ iss me off
I really can &apos;t imagine why .
One more step and he takes flight .
If I help you , what &apos;s in it for me ?
At the very least , your leg
You &apos;re right .
Go on , keep going .
En@@ ough .
Now , you ... you really are prepared to lose your leg
Back off , both of you .
But you know , about seven years ago ,
There was a great deal of ch@@ atter about a senior member
And the word on the street was that he
There was a massive bom@@ b , but it was set
She , for , yes , indeed , it was a woman ,
It &apos;s hero@@ ine and it &apos;s , um , it &apos;s ultimate trage@@ dy , for her bl@@ ast
But instead , it claimed the lives
He , amaz@@ ingly , escap@@ ed with only minor injuries .
I &apos;ve often thought about that female operative .
You know , what went wrong , do you think ?
Was it , u@@ h , was it poor intelligence , sho@@ d@@ dy equipment ,
Did she feel any re@@ mor@@ se ?
Any@@ way , the long and the short of it
She threatened to go all Edward Snow@@ den on them
Oh , how the might fall , eh ?
What do you think , Alex@@ is ?
Do you think such a myth@@ ical cre@@ ature could possibly exist ?
Because , boy , the dem@@ ons she must carry .
Now , I &apos;m going to take a different t@@ act here .
So I could always go back and finish
You know , boo@@ m .
Ye@@ ah , that struck a ch@@ ord with you , right ?
I have the feeling that you might bal@@ k at causing yet
Wher@@ eas me , h@@ m , I have no such qu@@ al@@ ms .
Why should I believe you ?
Because I don &apos;t lie .

Wa@@ it . So you are the invent@@ or of time travel .
Right ? It &apos;s fu@@ cking a@@ wesome .
So you weren &apos;t gon@@ na go back to 2015
If I was going to kill your dad , it wouldn &apos;t be with a gun .
What I would do is spi@@ ke his morning cock@@ tail
Fe@@ eding it to a shar@@ k .

A dam saved J@@ inc@@ ol@@ n !
That par@@ ade was the single greatest moment of my life .
More so than saving Lincoln ?
No , that was the third greatest moment of my life .
What was the second ?
A par@@ ade I attended as a child .
Oh , sh@@ it , you guys . I left my phone back in the 18@@ 00@@ s .

I wasn &apos;t jo@@ king yesterday . I was serious .
I want to stay here .
And I think you should , too .
I think we should make a choice
To live in this extraordinary place
with someone mira@@ cul@@ ous .
I told you you &apos;d think it was crazy .
Nothing is .
Everything is .
When you break it down .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s crazy .
Th@@ at@@ ll do .
For now .
It &apos;s done .
It &apos;s done . We &apos;re done . It &apos;s over .
S@@ ophie , S@@ ophie , my dar@@ ling , everything will be ok@@ ay .
Apart from the fact that the welcome decor@@ ations are down ,
We can take care of all of that .
The party &apos;s still a day away .
I &apos;ve just been speaking to this guy .
He &apos;s actually a journalist , and he wants to write
No , I know you keep saying that ,
What ?
I have never felt closer to my mo@@ m .
I know .
It &apos;s being in this place with her photos on the walls and ..
I &apos;m pregnant .
What ?
In exactly the same place that she was .
Only this time we know who the father is .
I am .
And I have you and my three d@@ ads ,
She didn &apos;t even have any@@ body to tell .
She must have been so sc@@ ared .
All right . B@@ ye .
I &apos;m the manager . It &apos;s on me .
As is this t@@ art@@ ar stain . It just ref@@ uses to come out .
You &apos;d think it &apos;s parents were Bapti@@ st .
Well , Manager , I need to get out of there
H@@ ey , everybody !
Me , me , me , me , me ,
I love being a bri@@ de .
You don &apos;t even have to pre@@ tend it &apos;s about anyone else .
Kin@@ da like me , when I was rich .
Pre@@ t@@ ty much every single day still .
Good news , bad news .
The good news is the r@@ ash is not spreading past my nuts .
And that &apos;s the good news .
I &apos;ll ask the obvious question .
Did it have anything to do with the r@@ ash ?
I mean , what are we gon@@ na do ?
It &apos;s not a traditional Polish wedding
I think O@@ leg &apos;s got that covered .
And did I mention we &apos;re a Bo@@ ingo Hot@@ spot ?
Take it down a not@@ ch .
You &apos;re selling it harder than Anne Ha@@ th@@ away
Oh , hi , I &apos;m not here to buy , just to look .
On a diet ..
since 1998 .
Oh dear lord , those look amazing .
Can I just smell a piece ?
Bon@@ nie , don &apos;t .

That &apos;s my favorite thing about the job .
Oh , Paris remin@@ ds me .

I once hi@@ d in the luggage cart for 12 hours
Oh , right . R@@ ick . What &apos;s he doing now ?
Me , every third Tuesday .
Ah@@ h , don &apos;t leave me hanging , ladies .
Watch the closing doors , please .
I am watching the doors !
It &apos;s hard not to . They &apos;re about to eat my box .
Ye@@ ah , real funny , si@@ r .
A girl said , &quot; eat my box . &quot; grow up .
Je@@ ez ! How could a dress be this big ?
This is just the v@@ eil .
I have to get something out of my bag .
H@@ old this by yourself for a second .
I can &apos;t find it . Here , take this .
What is this ?
A hundred dollars in change .
We need it for the wedding .
It &apos;s a Polish custom to throw change at the bri@@ de .
Lo@@ ose change ? Live animals ?
Is this a wedding or a cock fight ?
Max , this is heavy !
What do you have to get out of your bag ?
Some@@ thing important .
What is it ?
That is our Polish bri@@ de money !
Back off !
This is not the day to screw with me .
I &apos;m at the business bottom
Queen &apos;s Plaza .
Y@@ up . That &apos;s what would happen next .
What &apos;s the hold up back there ?
People are placing bet@@ s that I &apos;m hal@@ f@@ way to Ren@@ o
Rel@@ ax . After that sub@@ way ,
They came sm@@ elling like that din@@ er cheese
H@@ ey , everybody !
We look just like S@@ ophie ! I am so relie@@ ved .
All right .
O@@ leg , stop looking at us like that .
It &apos;s ok@@ ay . I &apos;m mar@@ rying you .
You guys look like the Four T@@ ops .
Well , two tops and a bottom .
O@@ leg , S@@ ophie doesn &apos;t want you to see her .
Jump on Ch@@ est@@ nut and start down the a@@ is@@ le .
And Ch@@ est@@ nut , I &apos;m sorry , baby .
I know you never wanted to do drag .
And , H@@ an , you &apos;re supposed to take this
This just went from best man to worst job .
What do you think , girls ?
Do I look like a vir@@ gin ?
Oh , listen ! I heard the tu@@ ba . That &apos;s my cue !
Oh , God !
Her dress almost killed us
Thanks .
We &apos;re still in shock .
Since your lawyer called US ,
This whole thing is so crazy .
We feel the same way .
They couldn &apos;t have switched our bab@@ ies .
It &apos;s got to be a mistake .
Maybe we should take a blood test .
M@@ om !
I told you to bring the green jacket !
I can &apos;t wear red with these shoes ! U@@ gh !
Yes . Carlos Soli@@ s loved his wife ..
Yes , Carlos Soli@@ s loved his wife .... .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll be ne@@ eding that test .
I &apos;m sorry .
Oh , that &apos;s ok@@ ay , swe@@ e@@ tie .
And just so you know , it &apos;s Chan@@ el .
You can have one of these by working very hard ...
or by mar@@ rying a man who works very hard .
Thank you !
What a poli@@ te little girl .
Why would you buy that house ?
I thought we &apos;d be here at least for a year .

U@@ h , I gu@@ ess I heard wrong .
You seem to be bo@@ unc@@ ing back just fine .
What are you talking about ?
When your friend called ,

Good@@ b@@ ye , gab@@ y .

You have got to call them .
Get them to stop it , or at least put some other girl up there .
Some@@ thing !
H@@ ey , my partners spent a lot of money
And they &apos;ll agree not to put them up ,
Hon@@ ey . I did the best I could .
I talked them down from $ 12@@ ,000 .

I mean , it puts US right back where we were
I know .
And what &apos;s Mike gon@@ na say when he no@@ tices
Oh , god . I h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t even thought of that .
Maybe I should just let them put up the b@@ ill@@ boards .
At least then when he k@@ ills me , I &apos;ll be famous .
You know , there is another way .
What do you mean ?
Good morning , Ren@@ ee .

We con &apos;t ...
Put him on the spot like that .

Explore it further ?
I know you only had a little bit of it
In that house , and I have to say ,
Well ..
T@@ t was
All right . That &apos;s not what I &apos;m talking about .
I &apos;m not talking about that kind of magic .
I know that this is

Not exploring other dimensions
What if this is something that I want to do ?
You want to 20 back ?
I want to help our relationship .
I love it .
How long have you been here , by the way ?

Have you expl@@ ored the grounds very much ?
I think I have a pretty good sense of it .
It &apos;s so pretty here , isn &apos;t it ?

Not really right now , but you &apos;re welcome to go on a walk .

She is un@@ fl@@ app@@ able .
I think when you go in there
Ye@@ ah , you throw out some like very specific examples
Oh , no , no , swe@@ e@@ tie .
I don &apos;t think we &apos;re supposed to challenge them .
What if they disappear or something , you know ?
What if they fre@@ ak out ?
I &apos;m just saying what &apos;s the harm in let@@ ting
Why do you think I &apos;m nervous ?
Give me your hand .
What ? Don &apos;t you trust me ?
You were sp@@ ying on me .
Well , y@@ e@@ ah . You were like over 20 minutes in there .
Over 20 .
we didn &apos;t agree it would be exactly 15 minutes ,
Ye@@ ah , but you know , we didn &apos;t agree
Wa@@ it , wait . In@@ timate , intimate mass@@ ages ?
Are you serious ?
I was not into .
I was ro@@ cking your body in there .
All right . All right .
I &apos;m sorry . I can see how
Ok@@ ay ?
It &apos;s a little conf@@ using . Sorry .
All right . It won &apos;t happen again .
Ok@@ ay .
Under@@ stood .
How was it in general though ?
Oh my God , it &apos;s so wei@@ rd .
It &apos;s so strange . It &apos;s really od@@ d .
I mean , you were just ... you were wonderful .
You were funny and charming , and you just kept telling me
Does he feel like me to you ?
He is you@@ .@@ he &apos;s just a little ...
He is you@@ .@@ he &apos;s just a little ..
A little what
You have a great sense of hum@@ or and everyone likes you and
You &apos;re not saying that like it &apos;s like ..
the better version when you &apos;re in there , right ?
No , no , no , no , no .
You &apos;re just .
Not at all . That &apos;s the crazy thing
What about the physi@@ c@@ ality ... do you notice any differences ?
No . No , not really .
Ye@@ ah .
You know what , the hair .
There &apos;s something about the hair .
The hair ?
J@@ I &apos;s a little different .
Come here . Let me see .
It &apos;s like , like kind of
I don &apos;t know . I &apos;m not doing it right or something
Don &apos;t worry about it .
Cool .
Oh , and you know what , you don &apos;t wear glasses .
You don &apos;t wear glasses in there and you seem totally fine with it .
I don &apos;t think the pocket dial makes as much sense
I would have .. So what do you think it was ?
Oh , you think that he called them .
Ye@@ ah , and to me that &apos;s a logical conclusion .
I@@ e looks like me .
E@@ than , you &apos;re looking a little un@@ comfortable .
Can I help you with something ?
Ok@@ ay , so according to you ,
We all go home tomorrow ,
Sometimes these things just happen .
Ye@@ ah , that &apos;s right . They do .
I don &apos;t buy it .
All right
And it basically says that ab@@ err@@ ations happen .
You can drive yourself nuts trying to deri@@ ve meaning
That &apos;s so interesting .
It is , isn &apos;t it ?
It &apos;s not that interesting
A minute later you fli@@ p that switch , the lights come on .
Now we all know how electricity works ,
Magic happened
Does he ru@@ in it by question@@ ing how or why ?
No . He enjoys it .
And I am not a gor@@ illa .
Don &apos;t worry about it . I got it
There a little bit le t .
Should we finish it
You can say that again .
Has E@@ than .. I mean your E@@ than
Like what ?
Well , Eth@@ an@@ my E@@ than and I ,
Like he knew when I was going to go in the house
Ye@@ ah , for the most part .
And you want to know if we shared our experiences also .
Gu@@ ess I &apos;m just cur@@ ious .
I can see that .
N@@ ailed it , n@@ ailed it .
I knew you had the aces .
Du@@ de , by the way , you &apos;re getting very good at this game ..
almost too good .
I &apos;m beginning to think this is like one long S@@ ophie con .
He clearly just let you win .
Yes , E@@ than . Ob@@ viously he let me win .
Come on , guys .
This is supposed to just be a friendly game
The reason he &apos;s not being fun is because he &apos;s not even playing
That &apos;s just how it works .
All right . Fine . I &apos;ll play .
Deal me in . You@@ l and me .
Come on .
You want to play one on ..
Ok@@ ay . All right . That &apos;s the spirit .
Come on , bud@@ dy . Let &apos;s get in the game .
Let &apos;s go .
All right .
How many cards do you want ?
Who@@ a !
E@@ than , just calm down .
H@@ ey , wait a minute , wait a minute .
T don &apos;t want to take all the credit here
What are you talking about ?
Do you want to tell her or should T ?
Is this necessary ?
I think it &apos;s important that S@@ ophie knows what &apos;s going on .
We &apos;re all friends here , right ?
Would everybody just tell me what we &apos;re talking about ?
What happened ?
It &apos;s nothing
It was actually kind of a brilliant move .
He didn &apos;t go to the gro@@ cer@@ y store .
He ended up s@@ ne@@ aking into the guest house ,
I can &apos;t fu@@ cking pre@@ tend to be you .. I am me .
You@@ . what the fu@@ ck are you talking about ?
Just shut up ! S@@ ophie , please .
That was you yesterday ?
Sorry , guys .
I didn &apos;t want to make like a thing here .
If you guys need some space or something .
If you want to like take the guest house , you &apos;d be welcome .
I &apos;m not going anywhere .
No , I want you to leave .

H@@ ey . It &apos;s E@@ than .
Um , I &apos;m really just calling to thank you
Maybe next session you can send us
Thank you very much .
Al@@ right , so we have to hit the keys at the exact same time .
This is a strange exercise .
On three , ok@@ ay ?
One .
H@@ ey , we &apos;re getting ready to head out .
You want to get changed ?
Well , all my clothes are back at the guest house ,
We &apos;re probably the same size .

Do you have anything like that ?

Come on , girls . Let &apos;s go .
They &apos;re just right in there ,

Y@@ ep . She &apos;ll be down in a minute .
And I &apos;ll be checking you out twice .
H@@ ey , S@@ ophie , sit anywhere you like .
Oh , u@@ h , let &apos;s see .
Where is lighting that will make me look most attractive ?
What am I saying ? I look good everywhere .
I am meeting man for first time that I met online .
I wonder if he &apos;s here yet .
Well unless you &apos;ve been cru@@ ising sing@@ les
You could meet my pole any time .
No , this will never happen .
You &apos;re not my type .
Well , what is your type ?
Wo@@ w , they have those automatic hand dr@@ yers that b@@ low you .
I love being blow@@ n like that .
Those look like two giant orange traffic con@@ es .
Are you trying to tell me not to park there ?
This is a lady .
Show her some respect .
S@@ ophie has new man in her life .
I am so mad I cannot see straight .
Well , I &apos;m looking right at him and I don &apos;t see straight either .
Carol@@ ine , I &apos;ve written down address of drug store
Here , I will pay for it .
Un@@ less it is cancer .
Then I &apos;m out .
And , Max , here is check for table seven .
Boo@@ y@@ ah !
How long is it gon@@ na take to see a doctor ?
I &apos;m stage one pre-@@ sick .
I need pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
I told you before , you have to man up
I &apos;m not like you .
I have actual things I feel .
Men@@ ach@@ em Gold@@ man .
This must be the orthodo@@ x Jewish neighborhood .
Ei@@ ther that or we &apos;re in Z@@ Z Top-@@ ville .
Max , have some respect .
H@@ ey , I got nothing but respect .
They basically invented southern rock .
I love the Jewish people .
Wh@@ enever I felt sick before ,
So your love was cont@@ ingent on p@@ ills ?
We &apos;re not that different .
Actually , the Kl@@ eins and I were very close .
I was invited to many pas@@ so@@ ver in their home .
In fact , they called me their hon@@ orary Je@@ w .
Ri@@ v@@ ka Sh@@ em@@ shel@@ ew@@ itz .
Well , you &apos;re no Ri@@ v@@ ka Sh@@ em@@ shel@@ ew@@ itz .
So why don &apos;t you just give Dr. Klein a call ?
I did three times and no return .
I gu@@ ess he doesn &apos;t want anything to do with me anymore
All those years I thought we were family .
Gu@@ ess not .
I don &apos;t know , ign@@ oring your needs
So@@ unds like family to me .
Carol@@ ine Ch@@ anning , Carol@@ ine Ch@@ anning .
Finally .
Let me do the talking .
I learned a lot of Hebrew from Mrs. Klein .
These are my people .
What can I get you ladies ,
Sorry , I didn &apos;t know it was an orthodo@@ x neighborhood .
You know what , we could just tie our co@@ ats around our wa@@ ists .
Max ?
Oh , and look at the bre@@ asts on this one .
Co@@ at on or off ? Make up your mind .
No , Bub@@ ala , I &apos;m just saving ,
It &apos;s been a few years , but trust me ,
Here you go , Es@@ ther Rach@@ ael .
How else do you think I land@@ ed
Oh , doctor ?
Oh , we &apos;re still on that ride ?
I &apos;m sorry .
It &apos;s just , I &apos;m so happy to be
I was very close to my neighb@@ ors , the Kl@@ eins .
In fact , they called me their hon@@ orary Je@@ w .
Stop now .
This is like when you tell Earl
We &apos;ll just get our money and go .
Take our money and go ?
What are we , barb@@ arians ?
Stay and celebrate a little .
But , out here in the kitchen , away from the men .
S@@ it , eat , come .
Three of my favorite things to do .
Good looks and funny . What a catch .
Had@@ ass@@ a , hand me a spo@@ on .
Tell me , Es@@ ther Rach@@ ael ,
Some@@ one &apos;s been on the Internet .
No way , this is a past@@ a and a des@@ sert ?

How would you like it if I told your mother
How is you gon@@ na say anything with your mouth full ?
Dam@@ n , son !
Come in here , ma . This way .
Don &apos;t say anything to her .
Let &apos;s just get our money and get out of here .
Max , she should know .
You w@@ anna ru@@ in their day and not get paid ?
Just keep it to yourself for five minutes and we &apos;re gone .
I want you to meet my mother , Hin@@ da Fa@@ gel .
Ma , this is Max who made the kos@@ her c@@ up@@ cakes .
And I &apos;m Carol@@ ine .
Ye@@ ah , hi , I think I &apos;m that kind of girl .
Max , what are you talking about ?
I made sure every single one of those
Yes , well , maybe my rab@@ bi didn &apos;t have such high standards .
I &apos;m so sorry ,
So close .
Max , I told you how important
Yes , you told me about tradition and family .
but none of that meant anything
And she was nice enough to put it on my head
Your atten@@ dance imp@@ lies it &apos;s not .
I like a party as much as the next man ,
Oh , by the way , don &apos;t forget ,
Oh , Shel@@ don , we don &apos;t need a meeting every three months .
Well , it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up
Lu@@ cky for you it &apos;s tomorrow .
Oh , you know what ? I &apos;m not going .
Well , you have to go .
It &apos;s Penn@@ y &apos;s first time leading the Ple@@ dge of Al@@ legi@@ ance .
This meeting is a waste of time .
Whether we make the switch
You realize one of them has sugar on the ra@@ is@@ ins .
You &apos;re the only one who e@@ ats them !
And yet you get to wei@@ gh in .
I &apos;m not going ; you can &apos;t make me .
Well , we &apos;ll just see about that .
What is the problem ?
He says he &apos;s not coming to the Ro@@ omm@@ ate Agreement meeting tomorrow .
Well , why the hell did I mem@@ ori@@ ze the Ple@@ dge ?
You have fun . I will not be atten@@ ding .
Oh , fine . We don &apos;t have to have
Y@@ o , A@@ my , just one second .
Meeting .
I mean , if it &apos;s a boy ,
Which means I &apos;m gon@@ na have to Google &quot; How to play catch . &quot;
they &apos;re so innocent and ..
you know how guys are .
Tot@@ ally , guys are the worst .
I mean , look at me .
Oh , good , go . You know , it &apos;ll be nice to
Don &apos;t get too f@@ ond of this character . &quot;
In one case , it &apos;s because they &apos;ve become involved
Ye@@ ah , but I won &apos;t say who it is .
It &apos;s Br@@ an !
Wa@@ it , what is going on ?
Leon@@ ard &apos;s being a jer@@ k , so we &apos;re gon@@ na watch over here ,
As long as I don &apos;t have to watch with him .
Fine , I don &apos;t want to watch with you either .
I &apos;ll go over here .
Why do you get to pick ?
Where &apos;d you get that from ?
From A@@ my .
U@@ gh . A@@ my , why did you tell him that ?
Because you were def@@ ending Shel@@ don like you always do .
I don &apos;t always defend Shel@@ don .
Oh , yes , you do . You know you have a wei@@ rd
What about your wei@@ rd relationship with him ?
That &apos;s different .
I &apos;m like the little girl in Pol@@ ter@@ gei@@ st
Um , guys ?
Your infections are getting worse .
Your infections , you mean .
I didn &apos;t have them before you two idi@@ ots operated .
And you didn &apos;t even do that right .
Again , I am sorry , but your lung cancer
I can afford any hospital in the world ,
When am I getting ou@@ tt@@ a here ?
I &apos;ve been here for three weeks .
This is not Gu@@ ant@@ an@@ amo .
Dis@@ charge her , please . I &apos;ll pay you .
There is not much more that we can do
Now get me ou@@ tt@@ a here before I sue your balls off .
Well , we &apos;ll run some tests ,
Give me a number .
Well , it &apos;s at a 0.@@ 8 now , and I &apos;d like it to be above a 2 .
It wasn &apos;t your fault . It was a massive M.@@ I .
After we inform Mr. Beck@@ ert &apos;s family ,
Is there a chance they could shut down the trial ?
Oh , it doesn &apos;t matter . I &apos;m gon@@ na shut it down , pending the aut@@ op@@ sy .
I want to know why we didn &apos;t see it coming .
I thought Dr@@ .@@ B@@ ail@@ ey said Tor@@ res can &apos;t be moved yet .
Yes , si@@ r , but since she has had no contact with the baby ,
I think it &apos;ll do the both of them good .
I mean , come on . I &apos;m all for mother / baby bon@@ ding ,
Why do you even ask me these things , hu@@ h ?
I thought you were a doctor .
I need your help with something .
Oh , wait . I have , u@@ h , Patient 122 &apos;s trial pack@@ et .
It was never opened , so it needs to go back into the lot .
Oh , ok@@ ay . One sec .

Thank you .

Yes , you do .
I &apos;m very busy .
I have been out in the forest ,

He analyzed the breakfast you gave him
He really war@@ med up to you .
He &apos;s a great k@@ id , isn &apos;t he ?
Ye@@ ah . Oh , ste@@ ak kni@@ ves .
Sometimes , I feel like a hy@@ pe@@ d-@@ up
My what ?
Your female energy .
Besides , you &apos;re the one that told me to go .
You said , you , you said , &quot; Go ! Take some time . &quot;
You know how hard this has been ?
Every@@ body at home is bl@@ aming me , y@@ elling at me ,
So it doesn &apos;t matter that I &apos;m finally happy
All that matters is what &apos;s happening to you .
Oh , you better not p@@ out , you better not cry .
All I have ever done is try to help you .
You &apos;re a cow@@ ard who &apos;s too afraid to be Santa Cl@@ aus !
Ex@@ ac@@ tly ! Bingo ! Par@@ tri@@ dge in a pe@@ ar tree !
That &apos;s what I &apos;ve been trying to tell you !
Then I gu@@ ess , that &apos;s all there is to say .
Wa@@ it , where are you going ?
I &apos;m going to the North Pol@@ e
Do you know what ? If I wasn &apos;t so enligh@@ tened ,
She &apos;s invited me over for Christmas morning .
That &apos;s amazing ! Oh , Alex would love that so much .
You &apos;re gon@@ na go , right ?
I think she just feels oblig@@ ated .
It &apos;ll probably be aw@@ k@@ ward ,
I &apos;m gon@@ na stay at home , put a fro@@ zen p@@ izza in the oven
D@@ ad ! The s@@ lei@@ gh is amazing .
I &apos;m glad you enjoyed it .
When are we gon@@ na see No@@ elle and Pol@@ ly again ?
Prob@@ ably never .
Pol@@ ly ! That ..
Well , I do have somewhere I need to be for Christmas .
But you &apos;re gon@@ na get your wish and spend
Because you &apos;re nice . I mean , officially .
Come on . Thanks , guys . It was ...
It was j@@ ol@@ ly .
Oh , I hope their Christmas works out .
Oh , well , look at you .
Wor@@ rying about someone else &apos;s Christmas and not your own .
Now that is very mature .
Thank you , Pol@@ ly .
What are you doing here ?
How did you get here ?
Did you fly here all by yourself ?
Pol@@ ly ! Look who it is .
You &apos;re so bra@@ ve . You must have picked up
How many people wear g@@ ing@@ er@@ bread de@@ odor@@ ant ?
Oh . What have you got ? It &apos;s from Mother .
&quot; No@@ elle , I know I was angry ,
Lau@@ gh .. mostly at you .
Which still makes it my best Christmas in a long time .
So , when Pol@@ ly came to see me
Wa@@ it , so you believe what I told you ?
I believe that you believe .
But to get out of here , stop talking about the North Pol@@ e ,
And it turns out there &apos;s nothing there
See ?
It &apos;s just a tradition we &apos;ve been
These things happen .
Oh , man !
The question is , what really makes a Santa ?
Ul@@ tim@@ ately , the one thing all Sant@@ as share
No@@ elle , can you insp@@ ire us ?
What does Christmas mean to you ?
I used to think Christmas was the best day of the year .
How long have you been out in the field ?
It should say there , in the file .
I want to hear what you say .
A long time .
I didn &apos;t know you smo@@ ked .
When did you start ?
Right after I qu@@ it drinking
I was a dr@@ unk
How do I feel ?
How do you feel about the girl ?
She asked a very good question .
Which was ? Why ?
Well , that &apos;s a question that needs to be asked .
We &apos;re vulnerable to qu@@ al@@ ms of conscience like anyone else .
We face these decisions every day , and we vote up or down .
Like everything else ,
To determine whether you are fit to remain in the field .
I hate that it had to turn out this way .
Me taking care of the girl , me taking care of the police
We have a station for you to look after .
Black@@ leg Min@@ er .
And one of the very few people who can process code at this level .
You and another team , altern@@ ating shi@@ fts . Three days each .
You keep the station safe , you keep the code safe .
Wh@@ atever it takes .
Ok@@ ay .

I was trying to make a jo@@ ke about
Sp@@ ell@@ -@@ checks are usually pretty accurate .
If they know the code from before , they &apos;re gon@@ na come back in .
They &apos;re gon@@ na use it again .
No , the codes change every shift .
They could have had David and Mer@@ edi@@ th &apos;s code but not ours .
Where are they ?
Take a deep breath .
We &apos;re gon@@ na walk . We &apos;re gon@@ na call for help . Ok@@ ay ?
&quot; Cardi@@ ff , Aber@@ de@@ en , Glasgow , Bel@@ fast , Oxford , Sl@@ ough . &quot;

Well , you have a piece of truck in your leg .
No way is a jo@@ ke gon@@ na make me feel more comfortable
Gri@@ t your teeth .
L@@ ooks like we missed the ar@@ tery .
But it &apos;s gon@@ na be ok@@ ay , right ?
You could still ble@@ ed ou .
Emer@@ son , lie to a girl , will you ?
B@@ ite down . I think it &apos;s starting to hurt .
That was bi@@ zar@@ re .
Emer@@ son !
Ye@@ ah .
I thought you left me .
How long was I out ?
Little while . Not long
Ye@@ ah .
So , what ? What ? They wanted to stop the broad@@ casts ?
You know as much as I do
S@@ it back down
They can &apos;t bl@@ ame us for anything
We &apos;re fine . V@@ e were am@@ b@@ ushed Cal@@ m down .
I am calm . But what are we gon@@ na do next ?
Stop walking around on your leg .
&apos;m fine . What do we do next ?
Jet &apos;s see what &apos;s down there .
We &apos;re Clear
He only fired two shots .
Oh , my God , it &apos;s David .
Oh , my God !
They must have thought he was dead . Bl@@ ed out .
He knew there was a gun hidden down here .
There it is .
If I wanted to cri@@ pp@@ le the system in one fell sw@@ oop ,
But they &apos;ve already sent the broad@@ casts .
I mean , what the hell do they want with us ?
They w@@ anna kill us . Make sure you don &apos;t cancel the broad@@ casts .
Grab that . Let &apos;s go .
Used to what ?
Bo@@ dies . Dead people . Se@@ eing them .
They never seem to stay dead . How &apos;s it going over there ?
There &apos;s stuff on here , but it &apos;s password protected .
I know , but can you open it ?
I don &apos;t know . I &apos;m trying
We don &apos;t .
Good . Just keep working
Can you just talk to me ?
Ye@@ ah , what do you w@@ anna talk about ?
Any@@ thing Just regular stuff . Like what normal people talk about .
Not really my strong suit , Ka@@ therine .
How do you know I dropped out of college ?
Oh , that was just a lucky gu@@ ess .
Grab@@ bed my file or something ?
You fit a profile .
O what ?
Ci@@ vili@@ an broad@@ cast@@ ers have a certain , you know , personality tra@@ it
Well , I can &apos;t work in silence , so you might as well just enter@@ tain me .
How about your profile ?
In@@ different and emo@@ tionally det@@ ached from reality .
In@@ ability to communicate with any other
W@@ illing to sit sil@@ ently in one place for hours at a time
No . Close .
No , I had a stable childhood
Rest@@ less . Sen@@ se of self-@@ enti@@ t@@ lement .
Stri@@ king lack of emp@@ athy or comp@@ assion for other people .
Stop .
You know , I , um , didn &apos;t always do this .
This is my first station assign@@ ment .
I was on the other end of the numbers .
Looking at nine million black@@ -@@ book tax dollars .
Rec@@ ru@@ ited me straight out of college .
Sa@@ id it was the best opportunity I &apos;d ever have .
T@@ old me I &apos;d do special things , important things .
Well , you &apos;re worth more than
Him@@ m ..
All they &apos;re really talking about is what &apos;s real . Re@@ ality .
They know how to use it . They &apos;re good at it .
I should have listen@@ ed to myself .
Where are you going ?
Now@@ here ! Where am I gon@@ na go ?
I &apos;m stuck here with you . Ye@@ ah .
And what have you got , hu@@ h ?
What have you got outside of this ? B@@ o you have a life ?
How could that possibly matter ?
What do you mean &quot; how does it matter &quot;
What have you got ? You &apos;ve got nothing to live for except for this !
M@@ mm@@ -@@ h@@ mm ... This is all you &apos;ve got .
You &apos;ve got your protocol . You &apos;ve got your numbers .
You &apos;re on the other side of the fu@@ cking numbers .
And you read them and you take their money .
You think you &apos;re not a part of this , hu@@ h ?
Do you think you can fu@@ ck around with these people ?
What &apos;s wrong with you ? What are you doing here ?
Will I die ?
No , you can live a long time like this .
need a doctor .
Can you take the bul@@ let out ?
It &apos;s a lot different than taking a piece of scra@@ p out of your leg
Here .
This is gon@@ na take the pain away for a while .
Wa@@ it .
I &apos;m gon@@ na wake up , right ?
Please .
We &apos;ll put the billi@@ ard room through there , eh ?
You ever play billi@@ ards , Tom ?
Best bloo@@ dy billi@@ ard players in the world , Australi@@ ans .
Sa@@ ys who ?
Well , ask anyone .
Best billi@@ ard players , best hor@@ sem@@ en , min@@ ers ...
A Fritz machine g@@ un@@ ner got a be@@ ad on us .
Ye@@ ah , it &apos;s Bor@@ is . It &apos;s a farm building .
They call it the Red House .
Soli@@ d as bloo@@ dy Gibraltar .
Our arti@@ l@@ lery &apos;s been bla@@ sting away at it for a week .
Who didn &apos;t show up until you arrived
Your point being ?
That it was bad enough my men being sh@@ elled from above
Now they &apos;re being min@@ ed from under@@ ne@@ ath .
If the man is wounded , Wood@@ ward ,
If he &apos;s not , then he should be back on duty .
Ei@@ ther way , he sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be here .
If you want my opinion , neither should you .
Good to feel wanted , eh , Ti@@ ff@@ in ?
W@@ ouldn &apos;t like to think we were over here
C@@ lay@@ ton &apos;s al@@ right . He &apos;s just got the wind up him , that &apos;s all .
H@@ ides it well .
People do .
Se@@ ems a sh@@ ame to waste this .
Spot of tea , old man ?
Oh , rather !
M@@ ama !
It &apos;s al@@ right , Ti@@ ff@@ in . It &apos;s al@@ right , son .
Hello ? Is any@@ body home ?
They don &apos;t belong to you , do they ?
Oliver , is that you ?
Mrs W@@ add@@ ell .
Col@@ in , Gordon , round the back .
Clean yourselves up before your father gets home . Now , please .
H@@ ey , h@@ ey , wait . That &apos;s not fair !
I was hop@@ ing I might catch M@@ off@@ at .
Ah . Well , you &apos;re too late , I &apos;m afraid . He &apos;s joined up .
Light Horse ?
Of course .
How was Pap@@ ua ?
You know , we thought the head@@ h@@ unter@@ s might have got you .
They took one look at my head and ran away .
Tell you something , though , Mrs W@@ add@@ ell ,
I think that &apos;s perhaps how we got here so quickly .
So , when I arrived I lo@@ os@@ ened the gir@@ th .
M@@ ust &apos;ve forgotten to cin@@ ch it up . St@@ up@@ id of me .
Are you sure you &apos;re not injured ?
No , I &apos;m fine , hon@@ est@@ ly .
Thank you for the tea , Mrs W@@ add@@ ell .
Mr W@@ add@@ ell .
Oliver .
Is@@ abel .
Any@@ thing ?
There &apos;s something wrong with this bloo@@ dy cand@@ le .
It &apos;s just making it dark@@ er .
It &apos;s not the cand@@ le , P@@ ull Through . It &apos;s the air .
Not enough oxygen for it to burn .
Oh , Jesus Christ !
C@@ ould be worse .
Oh , T@@ omm@@ o , how could it possibly be worse ?
Well , they could send us to Hill 60 .
What &apos;s Hill 60 ?
Mess@@ ines Rid@@ ge , just across the border , near Wi@@ pers &apos; .
The point , P@@ ull Through , is you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have
Still don &apos;t know what I heard , but .
Maybe it really was me heart .
Maybe I never heard no Germans .
Of course you heard &apos; em .
Don &apos;t make no difference .
Oh , fu@@ ck , man .
Cour@@ tes@@ y of the North@@ um@@ ber@@ land Fu@@ sili@@ ers .
Oh , bloo@@ dy generous of &apos; em .
Send &apos; em our regards .
Prob@@ ably not a good idea , Cor@@ p .
Ti@@ ff@@ in ?
We was ready to give up on you , P@@ ull Through .
We wasn &apos;t .
Well , we was .
Well , you was . You said .
Fin@@ ish your letter , W@@ alt , or get some more sh@@ ut@@ -@@ eye .
But the Lie@@ utenant knew about the str@@ ata , D@@ ad . How it holds up , like .
And that &apos;s why we kept dig@@ ging .
Oh , yes , si@@ r .
And how much explo@@ sive charge would you need to demo@@ lish that building ?
Dep@@ ends where you placed it , si@@ r .
How much would you need to do the job properly ?
50 pounds .
Do we have that in the stores or do we have to requ@@ isition it ?
We have it on hand , si@@ r .
There &apos;s a listening post at 105 Drive .
That &apos;d put you about 70 foot from Bor@@ is .
If we drove north from there ,
Oh , three shi@@ fts , 30 foot a day
Let &apos;s have it done before sun@@ -up , 0@@ 400 .
C@@ lay@@ ton , you &apos;ll have to cut a gap in the wire .
I &apos;ll have the arti@@ l@@ lery give you one hour .
Sir . Sir !
He couldn &apos;t get out of here fast enough .
Word is that b@@ ast@@ ard won &apos;t catch a train in case it &apos;s going down a tunnel .
It &apos;ll mean going over the bags ...
Keep your heads down , l@@ ads .
I nearly for@@ got@@ -@@ A present from Fritz .
He said to say , &quot; Thanks for all your help . &quot;
You &apos;ll be right , l@@ ads .
Thanks , m@@ ate .
To@@ o early for the grey hen , si@@ r ?
Never too early .
You &apos;re just skin and bones .
Come on , son .
She &apos;ll send me another par@@ cel tomorrow , more than likely .
Dec@@ ent fit .
My El@@ sa &apos;s a first-@@ rate k@@ nit@@ ter .
When we get back ,
Want to be a bit bet@@ ter-@@ Looking than the old one .
Your boy &apos;s gon@@ na make a great pro@@ p forward .
Don &apos;t I know it ? And he &apos;s still growing .
You join up together ?
One of them recru@@ iting blo@@ kes came through town .
G@@ ets the young f@@ ella all excited with his stories of adventure
Never spent one bloo@@ dy night away from home
El@@ sa &apos;s nearly had bloo@@ dy kit@@ tens , has@@ n &apos;t she , W@@ alt ?
Y@@ ep .
Actually ...
... I &apos;d like to ask you something .
I would like your permission
And .
.. I &apos;d like to spend some time with her before I leave .
So why Berlin Sa@@ p &apos; ?
It goes so deep under German lines ,
It &apos;s just mud and sl@@ ur@@ ry . Like sin@@ king a mine in a bo@@ g .
Ye@@ ah , the blue clay &apos;s further down .
This whole area is below sea level .
Ke@@ eping the water out was their main problem .
Was ?
Now it &apos;s ours .
We &apos;re 90 feet down now .
Right below German lines .
Hill 60 is directly above us .
The blue clay of Flan@@ ders .
Beautiful .
Major North , 3rd Canadian T@@ unn@@ ellers .
Fritz has set up in the swim sand .
He can &apos;t get at us . Oh no no no .
If you will .
8@@ ,000 pounds of g@@ unc@@ ot@@ ton .
I &apos;ve never seen anything like this before .
No , nobody has . No@@ body .
500 feet down there is a c@@ ater@@ pillar mine .
That one &apos;s 70@@ ,000 pounds .
There &apos;s 21 of them .
We &apos;ve under@@ min@@ ed the whole of the Mess@@ ines
You know , when this thing b@@ lows
Each mine has det@@ on@@ ators and leads running to the surface .
All we have to do is keep the bloo@@ dy thing dry
No , no , no . No . Fritz has got no idea .
He thinks we &apos;re dig@@ ging well@@ s .
Top level &apos;s mostly sand@@ .@@ C@@ lay starts around 30 feet .
Water se@@ eps down , pools above the clay .
Where it finds a tunnel , it f@@ unnels down like a bloo@@ dy cre@@ ek .
We have 60 blo@@ kes man@@ ning the pumps night and day
If we lose even a few of those men ,
Where did they get this lot ?
Defin@@ itely . Let us know how it goes .
Yes , when it came to a crisis ,
Fine . I &apos;ll talk to Sus@@ an .
Even if B@@ ree herself would have preferred to be a passenger .
As the mother of five ,
If &apos;s bad enough she st@@ ole your husband ,
What am I supposed to do ?
I &apos;m not gon@@ na drag Penn@@ y into the middle of this .
Well , apparently , Jane doesn &apos;t play by the same rules .
I think it &apos;s time to fight dirty .
Now some might say ,
Can you believe this guy ?
I would die for him .
Ye@@ ah . That &apos;s a healthy attitude .
So while you &apos;re opening your port@@ foli@@ os
B@@ ows of fruit .
Portra@@ its of children .
Did you look in my portfolio ?
As a matter of fact , I did .
I wanted to steel myself for dis@@ appointment .
Ok@@ ay , again , as a former teacher ,
Appar@@ ently not .
Don &apos;t talk , dear .
Her technique is at@@ ro@@ cious .
C@@ ats with cra@@ y@@ ons could draw more convinc@@ ingly ,
And I love it .
I would follow him into hell .
I think we already have .
Cel@@ ia , get back here ! Give me that now !
H@@ ey , h@@ ey , h@@ ey , enough with the scre@@ aming !
Come on . S@@ it down . Come on .
What are we having ? Sp@@ ag@@ h@@ etti and me@@ at-@@ shapes ?
Well , they started off as balls . What do you want from me ?
Is d@@ ad@@ dy eating with Us ?
No , swe@@ e@@ tie . He &apos;s taking a n@@ ap .
Cel@@ ia ! Use a for@@ k , not the dol@@ l .
M@@ om , remember that cabin on the lake ?
Can we rent it again
Spring ? It isn &apos;t even Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving yet .
I know , but we always plan our vac@@ ations in the fall .
Who knows what we &apos;ll be doing then ?
&quot; Sor@@ ry@@ . swe@@ e@@ tie . We can &apos;t rent that cabin
You can &apos;t promise that , Carlos .
It &apos;s been two months .
Nothing &apos;s happened . Rel@@ ax .
Where &apos;s this coming from ?
I &apos;m just saying , a co@@ p could show up at the door any day
And we don &apos;t even have someone to take care of the kids .
S@@ ure , we do . We named a gu@@ ardian when we did our will .
Look at US .
We were really a family then .
We &apos;re a family now . Ar@@ en &apos;t we ?
Of course . Oh , of course . It &apos;s just ..
Just what ? :
I don &apos;t w@@ anna say anything bad .
You should go wait out on the por@@ ch .
You don &apos;t need to sit here listening to my ...
legitimate wh@@ ining .
I don &apos;t w@@ anna go over there .
H@@ ang on .
You guys have a problem with ?
It &apos;s just , we &apos;re still learning how to take care of one k@@ id .
You &apos;ve got two , and they &apos;re both ...
You know .
What :
You know it . We know it . Why are we dancing around it ?
I was gon@@ na say &quot; Spir@@ ited . &quot;
See , they used to be like that .
They &apos;ve changed . They &apos;re all grown up now .
Now because she &apos;s crazy
In fact , we &apos;re going to save that crazy lady &apos;s life
G@@ ot it ?
T@@ old you I saw a lion .
I know you know .
Is this about Crist@@ ina again ?
She walks away every time I try to talk to her ,
I wish I could take it back .
Prob@@ ably .
Oh , qu@@ it it . Stop thinking about the hot or@@ th@@ o nur@@ se .
Wa@@ it . You ... you think she &apos;s hot ?
I-@@ I could see it in those eyes .
Those eyes said , &quot; You are meat . &quot;
What happened then ?
Then he l@@ ung@@ ed , and I just re@@ acted .
I sho@@ ved my arm right into his mouth .
Who the hell who does that ?
Who the hell fe@@ eds himself to a lion ?
I &apos;m kin@@ da wondering the same thing .
What do we got ?
And there &apos;s your arm .
Ye@@ ah , that &apos;s what you expect when you hear &quot; lion . &quot;
I bet it &apos;s nice to know what to expect
She never bo@@ ther@@ ed to mention she had a pet lion ?
Se@@ ems like something that ought to come up on a first date .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah . You shoul@@ da brought a b@@ ull w@@ hip .
So I dis@@ s@@ ect out and remove the animal c@@ ad@@ aver hearts .
Then I insert them with the cath@@ eters
Cor@@ rec@@ t . And why do we do that ?
To dra@@ in the hearts of their existing cardi@@ ac cells
Like stri@@ pping a house down to its frame only .
We are sc@@ rub@@ bing away cells of hearts , Crist@@ ina ,
We are wi@@ ping them clean ,
And then in theory .
when we in@@ ject them with stem cells ...
They &apos;ll live again .
Let &apos;s grow ourselves some new hearts .
Yes , you did .
But you &apos;re still a student ,
Any other questions ?
Are you gon@@ na tell Mark to move in with Julia ?
I mean , what do they even really talk about ?
I mean , plus , she has really thin hair ,
We don &apos;t talk about stuff like this .
I will see you in pre-@@ op .
You &apos;re not using the oil .
Alex uses his oil when T@@ omm@@ y &apos;s dist@@ res@@ sed .
We almost didn &apos;t come in .
We &apos;re only in town till tomorrow .
We &apos;re cat@@ ching a cruise for Alaska .
Mr. Car@@ roll , you &apos;re experiencing a heart attack .
We need to take you up to the c@@ ath lab
Can you tell me what you were doing
We just went out to walk around our bed and breakfast .
And it was like a piano fell
So you were walking .
You weren &apos;t running or anything else
Well ...
We saw a lion .
So that was a little aw@@ k@@ ward .
Don &apos;t you think , that thing with Col@@ le@@ en ?
Almost seems like you guys were a thing .
Ye@@ ah , she gets like that .
Oh , really ?
She gets like that , like you know how she gets ,
C@@ alli@@ e .
What ? It &apos;s not ... What ? I &apos;m just asking .
It &apos;s not a big deal .
Oh , we were . We were a ... a little bit of a thing
Se@@ ems like something you would &apos;ve mentioned .
Well , it didn &apos;t even occur to me .
Have you dated other people in the hospital
Ok@@ ay , you know what ? We &apos;re not doing this .
No , it &apos;s totally fine .
Not all of them . You don &apos;t know about K@@ are@@ v .
K@@ are@@ v . I know about K@@ are@@ v .
Look , just give me a number . Ball@@ park .
What , five ? Ten ? A hundred ?
Ok@@ ay , that &apos;s the N@@ IC@@ U . I have to go .
No , no , no , no , no . You can &apos;t just go .
I &apos;m sorry , but the bab@@ ies , they need me , so ...
Y@@ ep .
&quot; You &apos;re ign@@ oring me . You &apos;re a total ... &quot;
then there &apos;s a lot of strong language .
If you need to step away , just say so .
I &apos;m fine . Are we war@@ med ?
Yes , we are , doctor .
For what it &apos;s worth , I think you &apos;re doing the right thing .
She needs to figure out how to take care of herself
She &apos;s alone .
There is no time like the present to em@@ bra@@ ce it .
Turn it off . Please .
All right . Rem@@ o@@ ving the a@@ or@@ tic cross-@@ cl@@ amp now .
I see some ble@@ eding .
Dam@@ n it . The v@@ entri@@ cle &apos;s rup@@ tured .
Oh , no one thinks that .
They should .
Na@@ om@@ i does .
Got@@ ta be why she didn &apos;t tell me that Kir@@ by was a lion .
She knew I would &apos;ve fre@@ aked out .
We met on a dating site .
And when I saw her profile , she seemed ...
so adv@@ entu@@ ro@@ us ,
Maybe I mis@@ represented myself a little bit .
H@@ ang on . Kir@@ by was going for her
Son , you are a hero .
You were the k@@ night on the white horse
So ... I saved her ?
I &apos;ll tell you one thing ,
Re@@ ally ?
Did you tell her yet ?
When your surgery was finished ..
I went to look for your wife in the waiting room .
I thought that she had fallen as@@ le@@ ep ,
Oh , no .
H@@ ey , don &apos;t do that .
It &apos;s just a sound effect .
The ice isn &apos;t cra@@ cking .
They are watching to make sure
I mean , can you imagine the law@@ suits
Learn to have some fun in your life . Je@@ ez .
Who@@ ever did this is an artist .
What is that ?
But now the world &apos;s gone soft .
Everything is safe . Everything is careful .
So , we created a sport for people
and we provided them with a box seat
Our customers are some of the most powerful
But every year , they demand more .
More complicated rooms .
More interesting subjects .
More ways to gam@@ ble on life and death .
Last year , they had college athletes ..
There &apos;s only one Mr. White here
S@@ it down , Harry .
I said , sit down .
Don &apos;t make me tell you twice .
And you can wi@@ pe that sm@@ ir@@ k off your face ,
There &apos;s an hierarch@@ y around here ,
I &apos;m not a gang@@ ster , Mr Com@@ er
Some of them are quite pleasant and fun ,
I &apos;m looking for an employee who can handle the latter .
In no uncer@@ tain terms , I &apos;ll pay you a dec@@ ent sum
I &apos;m not looking for a bar@@ gain , Mr Com@@ er ,
I &apos;m a fair man and I expect you to do what I ask ,
Now , if you can do this ,
If you can &apos;t , I shall thank you for your time ,
Al@@ right , who invented copper wire ?
Who ?
Who &apos;s your unc@@ le then ?
Al White and who are you ?
Jack Spot .
I &apos;m the owner now , there ain &apos;t nothing on the house
How much is that Stanley ?
It &apos;s a gu@@ inea Mr Com@@ er .
Have one for yourself Stanley
Let &apos;s make it 30 bo@@ b and we &apos;re all good .
Lem@@ on@@ ade ?
If you &apos;re gon@@ na stand there taking bet@@ s ,
That doesn &apos;t .
yes you do , pay me the money .
But I don &apos;t have any .
Pay me the money ,
L@@ ay off him , he &apos;s mine .
Not anymore .
Dear Mr Com@@ er , my name is Bil@@ ly Hill
but it will definitely be the last .
And believe you me , I &apos;m a man of my word .

You &apos;re different though , you &apos;re smart ,
If you &apos;re at all interested in finding out more
Y@@ ours sinc@@ er@@ ely , Bil@@ ly Hill .

Well Jack , I ad@@ mire you see ,
How you took on the Wh@@ ites .
N@@ M 3 man We can much gn@@ u May .
That &apos;s &quot; um@@ -up hr he bu@@ cks .
Let &apos;s just say , I &apos;m expanding my horiz@@ ons .
Tell Jack I want him out of Soh@@ o .
I &apos;m back and I &apos;m here to stay .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll like that , Mr White .
What are you saying exactly ?
What I &apos;m saying , exactly , is if we &apos;re going to go on
Let &apos;s say we &apos;ll be having to turn
Where the fu@@ ck is all my money ?
Our money you mean .
Without this , I &apos;ve got nothing .
I been meaning to sort out my properties for a@@ while now .
Just had other priorities .
Being a land@@ lord is not to everyone &apos;s taste , running a pu@@ b ,
It &apos;s nothing that you ain &apos;t used to , Jack .
It &apos;s a lovely five bedroom flat up@@ stairs
We &apos;ll take it .
You &apos;re welcome R@@ ita .
Three ,
Charles thought you were Jack Bos@@ by ,
New blo@@ ke said he &apos;d never heard of you .
Sorry Jack .
What do you want Bil@@ ly ?
C@@ ame to visit you in hospital the first time ,
M@@ et your wife and she said something interesting .
So how are you doing ?
We were having a fight when he ...
I &apos;m feeling guilty &apos; cause I should have gotten him here so@@ oner and ..
Hon@@ ey , the doctors here are great .
He &apos;s gon@@ na bo@@ unce right back .
You have nothing to worry about .
You know what ? I am so happy that you guys came here . I really am .
But I am trying hard to be strong ,
You &apos;re gon@@ na lose it ?
Then we won &apos;t comfort .
I will be fine by myself . I am not a child .
I know you &apos;re not a child ,
I &apos;m fine . Re@@ ally .
Why should you f@@ end for yourself
Let me shoulder the burden . It would be my pleasure .
What kind of fre@@ ak are you ? Just leave me alone .
You are not my mother .
I told you that I am fine . Stop acting like my mother and go home .
I wish it were that easy , Z@@ ach@@ ary ,
Your father &apos;s not coming back .
I haven &apos;t heard back and I was getting a little concerned .
The girls and I were talking and we think maybe Paul Young killed Mrs. Hu@@ ber
I thought the whole point of having a cell phone
How can we move forward if you won &apos;t communicate with me ?
Mike , I need you to call me back . I mean it .
Can you take those off ? There &apos;s no way I &apos;m dres@@ sing him .
Gab@@ by , thank God you &apos;re doing this .
Be@@ ating up a second g@@ ay guy looks bad .
Yes , well , Carlos , in some circles ,
So why did you change your mind ?
I &apos;m about to be the mother of your child ,
So if I &apos;m gon@@ na get you out of this m@@ ess , you have to reci@@ proc@@ ate .
you &apos;re going to get up , without saying one word .
Doctor &apos;s appoint@@ ments , you &apos;re driving . I won &apos;t put a car seat in my Mas@@ er@@ ati .
I don &apos;t like the idea of this guy being around Juli@@ e 24@@ 17 .
He &apos;s a good person .
Mike &apos;s cool , D@@ ad . He car@@ es about us a lot and I like having him around .
So don &apos;t m@@ ess this up .
He &apos;s still a pl@@ um@@ ber .
You Hon@@ or , this whole m@@ ess is just a result of my lon@@ el@@ iness .
My marriage is a bit stra@@ ined .
After Carlos was convic@@ ted ...
No one &apos;s been convic@@ ted yet , Mrs. Soli@@ s . This is just a grand jury hearing .
Oh , no , I &apos;m talking about his other crime .
Oh . Right .
Go ahead .
Any@@ ways , he was placed under house arrest
He knows how men look at me and ...
Well , I didn &apos;t exactly ease his mind .
I ... fal@@ sely led him to believe I was having an aff@@ air .
Before Carlos &apos; house arrest , he was always working and he was never with me .
I thought that maybe if he believed I was having an aff@@ air ...
he would realize he loved me .
I know it sounds st@@ up@@ id . I do . I just ...
Is there a point to this ?
My point is that Carlos is an angry , je@@ al@@ ous Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ al .
She was just a sad girl with a lot of problems .
She did some terrible , crazy , sel@@ fish stuff .
But you tell me what she ever could have done to des@@ erve death
If &apos;s complicated .
It &apos;s so ... complicated .
And just like that , my husband began sharing my secrets .
You want some car@@ rot , Z@@ ach@@ ary ?
Secre@@ ts I had died to protect .
I &apos;d like you to meet Ir@@ ina .
Hello .
I am finally to meet the lovely P@@ rest@@ on family .
Nice to meet you . Ir@@ ina .
Um , P@@ rest@@ on didn &apos;t say he was bringing a friend .
Oh , she &apos;s more than a friend , mo@@ m . We &apos;re in love .
Yes , P@@ rest@@ on Sc@@ av@@ o had returned from his trip
Well , I will save you the trip ,
She wants nothing to do with your son .
She &apos;ll tell you herself .
H@@ ey , this is An@@ a . Leave a message .
And if you &apos;re my a@@ unt Gab@@ y , I know what you did .
Dro@@ p dead .
H@@ old that c@@ ab . I &apos;m coming with you .
ason V@@ ale Cot@@ ton
That young man is the first one here every morning
Well , I am sorry you don &apos;t appreciate him .
I think he &apos;s tremend@@ ous .
In fact , I have decided to give him a promotion .
A promotion to what ?
Vice president .
He@@ y. check my station@@ ery . I &apos;m vice president .
Well , a company can have more than one .
There &apos;s plenty of work to go around .
Because you had to be looking in a fashion magazine ,
Are we done sharing ?
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah .
Wo@@ w . So Paris , Prague , Madrid ...
It sounds like you guys saw everything .
But you still haven &apos;t told US how you two met .
Well , u@@ h , the first time I saw Ir@@ ina was on a beach in Nice .
how do you say ? A gold dig@@ ger .
You know , if you &apos;re right , she &apos;ll move on soon enough .
Ye@@ ah .
I need to talk to you guys .
I know that look . He &apos;s come to his senses .
I proposed to Ir@@ ina , and she said yes .
Ok@@ ay . I don &apos;t know that look at all .
You proposed ?
But you &apos;ve only known each other for a few months .
Ye@@ ah . But she &apos;s the one . I know it .
Oh , honey .
Why : The fe@@ ds don &apos;t care about him .
It &apos;s not the fe@@ ds I &apos;m wor@@ ried about .
Oh , so that &apos;s why you want to take him away .
Patrick Log@@ an ?
If my k@@ id shows up , he &apos;s a direct link to me .
That &apos;s how he &apos;ll find me .
That was 18 years ago .
Patrick Log@@ an does not care about you .
and he sure as hell does not care about my grand@@ son !
Ma , please .
I &apos;ll tell D@@ anny you were here .
Rob@@ in the stri@@ pper ?
You had sex with Rob@@ in the stri@@ pper ?
Now l &apos;ve got a lot of great ..
Oh , oh , sorry . I was just , u@@ h , showing my support .

It &apos;s ok@@ ay . If &apos;s ok@@ ay . I &apos;ve got this .
Ok@@ ay , bud@@ dy , why don &apos;t we get you some coffee ?
Why don &apos;t we not ? Oh , besides ,
Get your hands off me !
Andrew !
Sam , are you ok@@ ay ?
I &apos;m fine .
Exc@@ use me ? I think I &apos;m in the wrong place .
Does Sam Allen live here ?
That one . But he &apos;s not here .
Oh . Then I gu@@ ess I &apos;ll just , u@@ h , le@@ e these on his por@@ ch .
If you want the dogs to eat it .
Put it inside . If &apos;s un@@ locked .
Mrs. Ho@@ dge ?
What are you doing with a picture of Re@@ x ?
I &apos;m waiting .
He was my father .
What ?
This is not how I wanted you to find out . I am so sorry .
B@@ ree , let me explain .
Ir@@ ina really loved the ring , M@@ om . That &apos;s why she wanted
You can buy me another ring .
You sure ? N@@ ana &apos;s ring is worth a lot more
Yes , P@@ rest@@ on . I know exactly how much it is worth .
But I want your mother to know
So .. Let &apos;s eat .
My mother and father met at a bar .
He was single , so was she .
They had one night together , and then he went away .
When she found out she was pregnant , she called him .
He had just met you and said he was in love .
He offered to support her finan@@ cially ,
We are atten@@ ding my A@@ unt Flora &apos;s 9@@ 3rd birthday party .
Just tell her I can &apos;t come .
She &apos;ll be dis@@ appointed if we don &apos;t show up .
She &apos;s 93 .
She won &apos;t be dis@@ appointed for very long .
No , hang on . I followed all the proto@@ col@@ s
I made a written record request 72 hours in advance .
I checked the ti@@ re pressure on the car .
I even cont@@ acted the Cent@@ ers For Dis@@ ease Control to find out
F@@ Y@@ I , it &apos;s none .
A@@ my , the relationship agreement was not designed
You use it to get your way .
I use it to get the right way .
The fact that the right way is also my way
You gave me your word .
You &apos;re coming with me .
Maybe she &apos;ll dig it .
Women like a firm hand on the til@@ ler .
I can never find the til@@ ler .
I got a book ; it didn &apos;t help .
Ye@@ ah , I always thought if I were ever ens@@ la@@ ved ,
Now , I downloaded an app that
You &apos;re right .
I &apos;m smart as a w@@ hip .
I should be able to figure this out .
H@@ ey , listen , I kind of made plans
Then I thought if I did check with you first ,
You don &apos;t have to check with me .
Do whatever you want .
I gu@@ ess I was hop@@ ing for a different reaction , but ok@@ ay .
Re@@ ally , what were you hop@@ ing for ?
I don &apos;t know ,
And that would turn you on a little .
Ok@@ ay , I &apos;m an actress . Ask me again .
Do you mind if I spend the weekend
Wh@@ a .. the entire weekend ?
You mean I wouldn &apos;t see you at all ?
But li ..
No , no ..
I knew what I was getting into .
You can &apos;t put a s@@ addle on Leon@@ ard Hof@@ stad@@ ter .
Oh , my , is it getting hot in here ?
That &apos;s why you &apos;re lucky to have me .
Back in O@@ ma@@ ha , there are two different restaurants
Bern@@ ad@@ ette , remember , your character &apos;s the heal@@ er in our group .
You &apos;re in charge of healing all of us , not just Howard .
I can &apos;t help it .
Ten thousand .
Ye@@ ah , I don &apos;t think saving people is really for us .
You know ? Why don &apos;t you take that sh@@ it to the c@@ ops ?
They &apos;ll do it for free .
Tw@@ enty-@@ five thousand .
Five thousand up front .
Come on inside and meet the boys .
This is what I &apos;m talking about . Clean lines , nothing to profile .
N@@ one of that sp@@ inner , hydraulic sh@@ it to get you lit up .
What I &apos;m talking about , S@@ al , is you transpor@@ ting anything and everything
We surely don &apos;t mind being your fu@@ cking little mu@@ le , Don Carlos .
But we got@@ ta talk about our cut .
We &apos;re the one doing all the risks .
You know , I just remembered something . I need batteries and toilet paper .
And I need to get that Bra@@ d P@@ itt movie .
The one where he turns back into a fu@@ cking baby ?
R@@ unning low on milk , a few things .
I wonder where I could get all these items in one convenient location ?
I love the way you put &quot; fu@@ cking &quot; in the middle of a word like that .
I &apos;m gon@@ na start using that sh@@ it .
You see , guys , I kind of , u@@ h ...
.. look at my future empire as the Wal@@ m@@ art of bot@@ tom@@ -@@ dollar retail crime .
But , you know , we can &apos;t all be Sam Wal@@ ton .
That &apos;s my job .
And when my foot soldiers start talking about sh@@ it like cuts
And I don &apos;t need a partner .
And in your case , Pad@@ re ,
Co@@ inci@@ dentally , where I found you .
Now , Pad@@ re , I like you . I really do . I like your son too .
I really appreciate all the sh@@ it you &apos;ve done for me , you know ,
But some things , you just have to stop them before they start .
See , partnership leads to ambi@@ tion .
Ambi@@ tion leads to a word they don &apos;t use much any more .
Mut@@ iny .
Pap@@ a , what &apos;s that ?
It &apos;s bad news .
And I &apos;m Bri@@ ck .
Did you happen to mention that kid@@ n@@ apping ain &apos;t exactly what we do ?
I was there this morning .
You was at church ?
When I saw you guys take out that whole house and walk out without a scrat@@ ch ,
Bull sheet . What the catch ?
Ye@@ ah . Why didn &apos;t you just go to the c@@ ops with this ?
His voice box was cr@@ ushed when he was a k@@ id . He can &apos;t talk .
And then there &apos;s Mc@@ Queen . Prac@@ tically illi@@ ter@@ ate .
He &apos;s the baby of the bro@@ od . He was well on his way
But he &apos;s got a bit of an issue with authority .
Who@@ o !
That &apos;s a mighty fine det@@ ective job you &apos;ve done , son .
So you do know the O@@ o@@ die Brothers ?
Like I said , I know all .
I can &apos;t just bring them boys in &apos; cause some suit from Philadelphia wants me to .
Well , you can if some suit
The longer you stay down here , the more you &apos;re going to realise ,
No , Sh@@ eri@@ ff . Listen , I &apos;m just asking for , you know , a little cooperation .
Once this thing gets wra@@ pped up , I &apos;ll get out of your hair .
Why don &apos;t you let me worry about my county ?
We &apos;ll be in Dallas by mid@@ night .
I &apos;ll drive us until I can &apos;t drive no more .
Can you believe she went ahead and paid us five grand up front ?
I know , right ?
I mean , you &apos;d think she &apos;d have some trust issues , right ?
What if we get there and Ro@@ b &apos;s a baby ?
Well , if he &apos;s a baby , they got baby j@@ unk up there .
Oh , that &apos;s smart .
It &apos;s not like they &apos;re riding around
Besides that , them bul@@ let sc@@ ars didn &apos;t look too fresh on Cel@@ este &apos;s belly .
What if there &apos;s more than one k@@ id ?
Why are you asking me so many
What do you want to know ? ! What do you want to know ? !
How will we know which is Ro@@ b ? I &apos;m gon@@ na say which one &apos;s Ro@@ b !
How about that ? I &apos;m gon@@ na say , &quot; You know what , I don &apos;t want Kevin !
I don &apos;t want Michael ! No , I don &apos;t want Stephen ! &quot;
It &apos;s a dam@@ n simple sm@@ ash and gra@@ b !
We sm@@ ash wh@@ o@@ ever &apos;s in front of us and we take Ro@@ b !
Dam@@ n ! Pla@@ in and simple ! What ? Sorry , Lincoln .
The last thing I need is for you d@@ umb sh@@ its to draw more un@@ needed attention .
I mean it , Bri@@ ck . I better not hear sh@@ it about your little Texas job .
Keep your ass off the grid .

Oh , my God ! We &apos;re tra@@ pped !
I don &apos;t want to do this .
H@@ old on . Let me think !
Better get on this fu@@ cking case .
Ok@@ ay .
She has other things maybe she ought to be wor@@ rying about
I mean , she needs to worry about staying out of her fu@@ cking refrigerator .
Nice .
She &apos;s losing a huge war against the refrigerator .
What are you talking about ? Jack ...
She needs to find the fu@@ cking tre@@ ad@@ mill .
Stop it . That is so mean . She &apos;s my friend .
Well , she should mind her business .
Ok@@ ay .
That &apos;s why I don &apos;t come here .
Which one of the 20 bedrooms am I supposed to be staying in ?
Take the second one on the left .
H@@ ey , An@@ g , it &apos;s Jack .
I &apos;m just , u@@ h ... Happy Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving .
I wanted to call you , see how you &apos;re doing .
And also because my sister told me

H@@ ey , Jack , it &apos;s Miguel .
Hav@@ en &apos;t heard from you for a while , so ...
Sofia was asking about you .
Th@@ ought I &apos;d give you a call and see how you &apos;re doing .

Hello , Jack , this is Father Edward Dev@@ ine calling from Bishop Ha@@ yes High School .

Holy sh@@ it .

Yes , Coach .
And if Chil@@ dress tries to put you on a poster like that ,
I got you .
Have a little fu@@ cking pride .

We don &apos;t take any plays off , we don &apos;t let &apos; em brea@@ the .
As soon as they get over half-@@ court , we tra@@ p .
Even if the ball &apos;s in the middle of the court ?
Any@@ where and everywhere .
You can &apos;t tra@@ p if the ball &apos;s in the middle of the floor . You need the si@@ del@@ ine .

Well , I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s about to get harder .
H.@@ R. wants to talk to you today .
H.@@ R. ?
The an@@ onymous har@@ ass@@ ment complaint
Oh , god .
Ye@@ ah , and , legally . H.@@ R. has to investigate ,
And that might be the end of it .
And if it &apos;s not ?
I have no time for this today .
No contact with Mur@@ phy , ok@@ ay ?
H@@ ey , Der@@ ek ! Are you coming by the lab today ?
We &apos;re starting to lose all our phase two moment@@ um .

All right . You good here ?
Ye@@ ah . Thank you . M@@ m-@@ h@@ mm .
I understand that I broke a rule ,
Have you cu@@ dd@@ led him ?
No , I have not .
Well , if I were left in a card@@ board box ,
Oh , I think I &apos;d want a cardi@@ ac c@@ ath
He is like a puzzle that I can &apos;t solve ...
Did a h@@ ack job .
Look , it &apos;s closing up already .
Um , I &apos;m going to re@@ open .
Um , pre@@ p a ballo@@ on cath@@ eter .
Did you notice anything about his mit@@ ral valve ?
I don &apos;t know .
Sh@@ ane , come on .
This is like a puzzle .
I found the corner pieces . I need help with the sky .
The valve le@@ af@@ lets were thick@@ ened and shor@@ tened .
A par@@ ach@@ ute mit@@ ral valve ?
A a grown man .
Not a child whose legs
And f@@ ailing . I &apos;m sorry . It &apos;s true .
And hon@@ est@@ ly . I mean , before last year ,
Ok@@ ay . So you think this is about you ?
It &apos;s about Al@@ y@@ ss@@ a . It &apos;s not about me .
But it &apos;s not about you , either .
Why would you say that it &apos;s not about me ?
You have to really be delicate .
I want to ask you about something ,
And , u@@ h , the act of me asking might be breaking them .
You can ask .
There was a complaint .
That &apos;s a question ?
I thought it might be you .
It wasn &apos;t .
I know , but it made me wonder
because I didn &apos;t want you to .
I didn &apos;t .
Good .
Oh , now that sounds like co@@ er@@ ci@@ on .
Like I &apos;m telling you how you were supposed to feel .
I didn &apos;t take it that way .
Re@@ ally ?
You &apos;re not just saying that to cur@@ ry favor ?
Because you never have to do that .
You don &apos;t have to get Sh@@ ep@@ herd coffee
You &apos;re too good of a doctor for that .
And when you look back in 10 years ,
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;ll even be a doctor in 10 years .
Oh , shut up . You will . You better .
Now , that &apos;s co@@ er@@ ci@@ on .
That should be you down there .
Who car@@ es ? I &apos;m doing an organ recovery .
I &apos;ll basically be on general , cardi@@ o@@ thor@@ ac@@ ic ,
Wo@@ w . I &apos;ve got to go up to H.@@ R. to fill out an accident report .
Oh , for h@@ itting Rob@@ b@@ ins with a gur@@ ney ?

L@@ ooks good .
App@@ endi@@ x is holding .
Gu@@ ys , guys , guys , the k@@ not@@ s are coming back .
M@@ om , I &apos;m b@@ ailing on our trip !
I made D@@ ad play and we fle@@ w our dr@@ one into your face !
A man named Ni@@ gel P@@ ickl@@ es
I &apos;m gon@@ na go .
Stop !
S@@ it down !
Cle@@ arly , you all have bad news to tell me .
But do you have to d@@ ump it on me when I &apos;m in a good mood ?
Oh , my God , you did !
That &apos;s what the window is !
The one hour a month when I am a human to you people .
Sometimes it &apos;s longer .
Let me tell you something .
Save it . I know where I &apos;m not wanted .
And no , I &apos;m not trying to gu@@ ilt you .
I can &apos;t waste the energy on that ,
Cla@@ ire
No ! We are going to sit here in silence
No drinking !
For you .
If M@@ om starts to think the monster sounds familiar ,
And hurt St@@ ella &apos;s feelings ? Think !
De@@ de ? What are you doing here ?
Our children are hor@@ ri@@ ble .
I &apos;m sorry to bar@@ ge in .
I &apos;m the director of the Gil@@ bert Foundation .
Oh , so you &apos;re the one who gets to choose the grant winner .
Hal@@ f a million dollars !
And they &apos;re all a good candidate .
Julia runs the selection committee .
and she &apos;s very pas@@ sionate about the candidates .
Sorry . I have a st@@ ack of papers on my desk .
I better get going .
B@@ ye .
So , where &apos;s your son ?
G@@ il got stuck in Peru .
He &apos;s been doing some consulting work for the ... . government .
R@@ ough terrain . Sli@@ ding down this hill ,
And metal dra@@ g@@ ging over the rocks ,
If it was anywhere near the tank .
P@@ unc@@ ture , spar@@ k , boo@@ m .
We &apos;re in a ra@@ vine at the edge of campus ,
No sk@@ id marks .
Me@@ ans the driver didn &apos;t pump the bra@@ kes
L@@ ooks like he went clean over .
That &apos;s gas@@ oline .
You know , I don &apos;t think this explo@@ sion
There &apos;s a de@@ br@@ is trail here .
Here we go .
G@@ ot something here .
This looks like a det@@ on@@ ator , Ray .
I think I have another piece of it here , Nick .
Lam@@ bert didn &apos;t just drive into this ra@@ vine .
He had a little help .
We got a point of explo@@ sion here .
Ok@@ ay .
K@@ iller wa@@ its for Lam@@ bert to leave the party ,
That means that the k@@ iller was on campus .
Let &apos;s get the frag@@ ments over to trace ,
I found nit@@ rates on the bom@@ b frag@@ ments
The last time we saw
Exc@@ ept those devices were more sophisticated .
Ye@@ ah , well ,
The cur@@ ved shape would have given the bl@@ ast
I &apos;ve recovered a partial serial number
L@@ ooks like you got a hit .
Company that makes
L@@ ooks like our b@@ ell@@ -@@ shaped charge
Sha@@ ke Al@@ ert .
I got one of those .
What do you need with a de@@ af fire alarm ?
Fine .
Are you guys all right ?
Ye@@ ah , we &apos;re fine . We &apos;re fine .
You ok@@ ay ?
Ye@@ ah .
The par@@ ame@@ dic@@ s took Julia Hol@@ den to the hospital ,
Right before the explo@@ sion ,
place a package on her desk .
You think it was the bom@@ b ?
Well , we already know that Michael
The bom@@ b in Dr. Lam@@ bert &apos;s car didn &apos;t give us much ,
Ye@@ ah .... y@@ e@@ ah , maybe enough to pin this on Michael .
Pi@@ ece of a box .
L@@ ooks like the bom@@ b was
You know , most ..
package bom@@ bs are rig@@ ged to explo@@ de when you open them ,
He &apos;s Julia &apos;s T.@@ A .
I find it so hard to believe
When I went to take Julia &apos;s statement just now ,
Do you know what this means ?
That means &quot; Sweet pe@@ a &quot; In L@@ S@@ Q .
It &apos;s Que@@ bec Sign Language .
Well , you &apos;re right , Se@@ an ,
Thank you very much . It &apos;s ok@@ ay .
But we didn &apos;t give you a poly@@ graph ,
It actually measures your brain &apos;s response to sound .
During the test , we played a series of clicking sounds .
You acted as though you didn &apos;t hear them ,
The sp@@ ik@@ es in your brain wave
You &apos;re not de@@ af , Se@@ an . You &apos;re a fraud .
You &apos;re also a k@@ iller .
Se@@ an Wy@@ att still isn I talking ,
So he fak@@ ed being de@@ af
And if Dr. Lam@@ bert found out that he was a fraud ,
Well , Se@@ an lied about being de@@ af ,
His real name is Se@@ an W@@ v@@ att Leb@@ lan@@ c ,
Some@@ thing that no one on the campus would understand .
My career has been my life .
I didn &apos;t realize how lon@@ ely I was .
We .... we all have this need
And when we do ,
He was using me .
I &apos;m sorry , Julia .
Is there anything that you know about Se@@ an ?
Any@@ thing that might help us ?
But they sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be hard to get .
Where can I find this guy ?
We leave tomorrow .
This
Get@@ ting out of the cell block
The gr@@ ate and bars are weak ,
That &apos;s why I figured out the saf@@ est
We do it in the day ,
The per@@ im@@ eter guards are less predic@@ table ,
It &apos;s the only way to avoid the je@@ ep pat@@ rol .
Now , in the yard tomorrow , there &apos;s a so@@ cc@@ er game at 2 : 00 .
That should prove some dist@@ rac@@ tion inside .
And yesterday when we were dig@@ ging ,
L@@ ook@@ ed like he turned away ,
It &apos;s not much of a break .
No , but it is
If we &apos;re going to get around these guys ,
It &apos;s not going to be easy .
There &apos;s only one real road that goes to the prison .
We don &apos;t want a real road that &apos;s not an option .
What ?
Your brother &apos;s cutting it close .
You said a week .
Tom@@ orrow &apos;s Wednesday , you didn &apos;t leave much room for error .
You want it ? C@@ ause I &apos;ll keep it .
Let &apos;s get this done .
We &apos;re gon@@ na have to watch both guards simultaneously .
Your cell should provide
Keep track of everything he does and when he does it .
Look for that gl@@ are , see if it shows up again .
What will you be doing ?
Wat@@ ching the other tower from here .
Go take a walk .
When &apos;d you meet your boy@@ friend , W@@ hi@@ st@@ ler ?
My last year of school .
I worked in this place in San Is@@ abel .
He used to come around
H@@ itting on the wa@@ it@@ ress . That &apos;s romantic .
He ist
His mother lives there in a retirement home .
What &apos;s going on ?
Out of the car , Juan Bob@@ o
You need to sign in
I was just about to .
Have you read the ru@@ leb@@ ook ?
Yes , si@@ r .
Read it again .
On the other side , when we get out of here ,
We &apos;re gon@@ na meet someone from this company
And then they &apos;re gon@@ na kill me .
You know that .
If they wanted to kill you .
you &apos;d already be dead .
I don &apos;t see why they keep me alive .
It &apos;s like you said you &apos;ve got something they want .
Once I give it to them , I &apos;ll be no use to them .
Right ?
I don &apos;t have all the answers .
All I know is it &apos;s my job to get you out of here .
Let &apos;s go .
W@@ ash my feet .
So what do we do now ?
I don &apos;t know .
Well , I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not good enough .
Please just give me a moment to think .
W@@ ast@@ ing time is not an option for me , Michael .
I need to be out of here by tomorrow .
That &apos;s my trip log , I &apos;ve told you .
I need to re@@ trace my steps .
I &apos;m doing everything they tell me , the same thing you are .
just , just leave me alone , please .
You know , before I was arrested ,
They know the name of everyone I care about
Well , they already found everyone I care out . Ok@@ ay ?
If you can &apos;t get me out of here , tell me now .
because time is running out .
Hu@@ h ?
Look , it &apos;s hot today .
Ye@@ ah .
Pre@@ fer the heat than the cold any day .
You know my brother and I wanted to come
When this is all over , why don &apos;t you do it ?
To@@ o much bad stuff &apos;s happened .
Still , you can make it work .
It &apos;s only gon@@ na work if if W@@ hi@@ st@@ ler co@@ operates .
he plays games , people get hurt .
But if he can &apos;t fix it , it might be time
Like my n@@ ana .
Ladies and gentlemen , we &apos;re out of order .
Sweet mercy ! Without R@@ alp@@ h , we &apos;re do@@ om@@ ed !
They &apos;re going to pull our plug !
Ok@@ ay , everybody , calm down .
R@@ alp@@ h probably fell as@@ le@@ ep
See ? There he is now .
You &apos;re not from here , are you ?
No , well , y@@ e@@ ah . I mean , not from right in this area .
I &apos;m just doing some work here .
What kind of work ?
Some routine cand@@ y tree tri@@ mm@@ ing .
You probably want to stand back .
In fact , this whole area
Who &apos;s &quot; we &quot; ?
Cand@@ y tree department .
Oh ! Where is everybody else ?
Ah , it &apos;s just me today .
So you just meant like the royal &quot; we &quot; ?
Y@@ ep . That &apos;s right .
H@@ ey , are you a ho@@ bo ?
No . I &apos;m not a ho@@ bo , but I am busy .
Ok@@ ay ? So you go home .
What &apos;s that ? Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t hear you .
Your breath is so bad it made my ears num@@ b .
Listen , I tried to be nice .
I tried to be nice .
S@@ our Bill , that gli@@ t@@ ch cannot be allowed to race !
And bring that thing to my castle .
Gu@@ ys ! She took ...
Or@@ -@@ e-@@ oh O@@ re@@ o !
Or@@ -@@ e-@@ oh
M@@ m-@@ k@@ ay .
Mil@@ k my du@@ ds ! It &apos;s W@@ re@@ ck-@@ It R@@ alp@@ h ?
Ye@@ ah . Who are you , the guy that makes the don@@ uts ?
Please . No . I &apos;m King Cand@@ y !
I see you &apos;re a fan of pink .
Sal@@ mon . Sal@@ mon , that &apos;s obviously ...
What are you doing here ?
Just get me out of this c@@ up@@ cake ,
Your medal ? Bad guys don &apos;t win med@@ als .
Well , this one did .
I earned it over in Her@@ o &apos;s Dut@@ y .
You gam@@ e-@@ j@@ ump@@ ed ?
R@@ alp@@ h , you &apos;re not going Turbo , are you ?
What ? No , no .
Because if you think you can come in here to my kingdom
It &apos;s not my fault one of your children
&quot; Children of the cand@@ y corn &quot; ? Who &apos;d ..
The G@@ lit@@ ch !
The coin she used to buy her way into the race .
That was your medal ?
She did what ? I need that back !
Well , I &apos;m afraid I can &apos;t help you . It &apos;s gone , you know .
It &apos;s nothing but code now .
It will stay that way until someone wins the cup
Maybe I &apos;ll have to have a little talk
Is that a threat I smell ?
If I ever see you here again , W@@ re@@ ck-@@ It R@@ alp@@ h ,
F@@ unge@@ on ?
Fun dun@@ geon , you know ? It &apos;s a play on words .
It &apos;s the ..
Never mind ! I &apos;ve got a gli@@ t@@ ch to deal with , thanks to you .
Good@@ b@@ ye , W@@ re@@ ck-@@ it R@@ alp@@ h ! It has@@ n &apos;t been a pleasure .
This thing is hard as a rock .
I can see that .
Check her out .
Oh , Van@@ ello@@ pe , it &apos;s so ... You .
But you have to back out of the race . Ye@@ ah .
Oh , no , I don &apos;t ,
So , y@@ e@@ ah , I &apos;m definitely racing .
Ye@@ ah , well , King Cand@@ y says gli@@ t@@ ches can &apos;t race .
Stop it ! Stop ! You &apos;re breaking it !
Please !
I just want to race like you guys .
You will never be a rac@@ er because you &apos;re a gli@@ t@@ ch .
And that &apos;s all you &apos;ll ever be !
H@@ ey ! Leave her alone !
Let &apos;s get out of here !
Before I throw you in the mud !
What are you looking at ?
You &apos;re welcome , you rot@@ ten little th@@ ief .
I &apos;m not a th@@ ief ! I just bor@@ ro@@ wed your st@@ up@@ id coin .
I was going to give it back to you as soon as I won the race .
It &apos;s not a coin . It is a medal
Just go back to your own d@@ umb game and win another one .
I can &apos;t . I didn &apos;t win it in my game .
I won it in Her@@ o &apos;s Dut@@ y .
You &apos;re never going to break ..
Hu@@ h .
Enjoy your little tan@@ trum , di@@ aper baby ?
Leave me alone .
Look , you want that medal , right ? And I want to race .
So here &apos;s what I &apos;m thinking .
You help me get a new cart .. A real cart ...
And I &apos;ll win the race and get you back your medal .
You want me to help you ?
All you got to do is break something for me .
Come on . What do you say , friend ?
We are not friends .
Oh , come on , p@@ al . You son of a gun .
Come on , bud@@ dy . Let &apos;s sha@@ ke on it .
R@@ alp@@ h , my man . My main man .
H@@ ey !
My arm &apos;s getting tired . Do we have a deal or not ?
You better win .
Well , I &apos;ll say this much ,
There &apos;s the shuttle .
Is he in there ?
N@@ ope . Lu@@ cky for him .
Otherwise I would have sl@@ apped his cor@@ p@@ se .
No C@@ y-@@ Bu@@ g , either .
G@@ ot to find it before it la@@ ys its fil@@ thy eggs .
It came this way ,
Can &apos;t get a read on it .
So what is it with this W@@ re@@ ck-@@ It j@@ ok@@ er ?
Why did he go AW@@ O@@ L ?
I wish I knew , ma &apos;@@ am .
Go@@ ing on about cake and med@@ als ...
But I never thought he &apos;d go Turbo .
&quot; Go Turbo &apos; &quot; ?
That &apos;s right , you guys just got plu@@ gged in .
Well , back when the ar@@ cade first opened ,
And Turbo .. Turbo
I probably can &apos;t have children .
What is wrong with her ?
She just had her car@@ pet ste@@ am-@@ cleaned .
You two still haven &apos;t figured out this machine ?
Mo@@ ve away . I &apos;m Asian and a man .
I &apos;m good with this kind of stuff .
Well , H@@ an , actually , it &apos;s pretty dangerous .
H@@ ey , H@@ an &apos;s a man , according to recent l@@ ore .
Let him save the day .
Ok@@ ay , let &apos;s see . Here &apos;s the steam one .
My neck !
It burned my neck !
And that was my best feature .
Lu@@ ck@@ ily you &apos;re not t@@ aller .
You would &apos;ve burned your vag@@ ina .
That c@@ app@@ u@@ cc@@ ino machine might have just
Carol@@ ine , I know this might not be a good time .
But what did S@@ ophie say ?
I &apos;m sorry , O@@ leg . S@@ ophie &apos;s moved on .
She &apos;s seeing other men .
Ye@@ ah , but not in your neighborhood .
She &apos;s cl@@ assy .
She had the dec@@ ency to do it on a st@@ oop in St@@ aten Island .
She went to the island without me ?
We were going to travel the world together .
O@@ leg :
Sa@@ ys the man who coo@@ ks the food .
H@@ ey , what &apos;s this area back there ?
U@@ h , it &apos;s our clos@@ et , why ?
I should check it out .
I &apos;m always looking for places
Is O@@ leg in here ?
I thought I sm@@ elled him .
That delicious mix of man and butter .
O@@ leg &apos;s in the clos@@ et .
Oh , honey , I could &apos;ve told you that .
Re@@ ally , lu@@ is , O@@ leg is straight .
Wa@@ it till you see what happens
No , no , no , no , no , no , I work for a din@@ er .
I don &apos;t work for you .
Don &apos;t bring me into your drama .
Oh , I have to get this .
It &apos;s my mother . She &apos;s on death watch .
But we used to have the same machine
M@@ ami , com@@ o est@@ a su lo@@ u geh@@ rig &apos;s ?
No , I am not working at St@@ arb@@ u@@ cks .
That &apos;s not what I was gon@@ na say .
Just for two hours .
We can qu@@ it after we learn how to work this dam@@ n machine .
Press here for an o@@ unce of grounds .
T@@ amp it in , pack it down , turn it on .
I didn &apos;t get that , did you ?
Hon@@ est@@ ly , all I heard was group head .
So you t@@ amp , pack , turn the kno@@ b ,
Place the steam wand hal@@ f@@ way in the pit@@ cher
So what you &apos;re saying is it &apos;s easier to make met@@ h ?
Sy@@ ru@@ ps , pow@@ ders , whi@@ pped cream is right here .
You ever work with one of these ?
I think I can handle it . I went to Wh@@ art@@ on .
Well , I went to Harvard .
Small scra@@ p , ni@@ pp@@ le sla@@ p , half half .
That &apos;s not what I said .
T@@ all cap tri@@ ple@@ -@@ shot half ca@@ f ?
Girl , you &apos;re good at this .
You should work at St@@ arb@@ u@@ cks .
I am good . I think I &apos;m getting the hang of this .
This thing h@@ ates women so much ,
Or Ohio .
Or , to be honest , most of America .
I &apos;ll have a tall dri@@ p , extra hot .
U@@ h , what &apos;s your name ?
Can you two explain what this is ?
I &apos;d say it &apos;s pretty obvious .
That &apos;s a penis wearing a hat .
Why ?
Because it &apos;s bald and a little in@@ secure .
That state department agent wants to meet
Ch@@ ania , please ?
Thank you .
It is safe here .
I use when I come .
You got any food for him ?
Come , it &apos;s in the boat .
Who are you working for , really ?
And why were you trying to take out Kan@@ iel Ou@@ tis ?
Never thought I &apos;d see this face again .
You weren &apos;t supposed to .
Why ?
I &apos;ll tell you everything you want to know .
And it &apos;s a mistake to lie to me .
I@@ can have you prosec@@ uted .
I have a contact at the N@@ SA and she gave me proof .
You &apos;re not calling him junior , are you ?
I promised you I would never do that .
He &apos;s an amazing k@@ id .
I knew I was being set up .
He was tigh@@ tening his control over me ,
At least , that &apos;s what he thought .
When I knew Pos@@ ei@@ don had gone ro@@ gue
You &apos;re not .
We got it , Su@@ c@@ re . Get to crete .
He &apos;s not gon@@ na hurt Mike .
not unless he susp@@ ects you know who he really is .
If you remove his mask ,
You know him better than I do .
That &apos;s the point , no one knows him .
So , what do I do ?
You play his game . You wear your own mask .
As soon as you get a chance to get away with Mike ,
I &apos;ll get to the states as soon as I can .
H@@ mm .
Ye@@ ah ?
We spoke to our man at the Pent@@ ag@@ on .
A nav@@ al alert just went out .
Kan@@ iel Ou@@ tis has been located
It was reported by the ship &apos;s captain .
What &apos;s the Navy gon@@ na do about it ?
So , when I was a teen@@ ager ,
R@@ an into a few bodies :
And all of them were named Anthony .
Back in the good old days , when the Mo@@ b really knew
Ah , y@@ e@@ ah .
Prob@@ able internal head trau@@ ma on that side .
Inter@@ esting pattern to this wo@@ und .
Maybe he hit his head on the rocks ?
Well , it &apos;s an L-@@ shaped wo@@ und , so , not a rock .
Prob@@ ably a pist@@ ol but@@ t .
That means he was dead before he hit the water
Well , maybe there was a struggle at the edge of the water .
Or a body d@@ ump .
Shirt &apos;s tor@@ n .
Ambi@@ ent tem@@ p &apos;s 97 , water &apos;s 107 ,
So , calculated PM@@ I is four to seven hours .
Well , air unit didn &apos;t see any other cars ,
Gu@@ y &apos;s out here in the middle of no@@ where
How &apos;d he get out here ?
And who was he with ?
How &apos;s it going ?
Fo@@ und a bloo@@ dy print on the inside of the box .
Blood &apos;s not human .
It &apos;s all go@@ at &apos;s blood ?
Well , as soon as they develop
But in the meantime , the print &apos;s pretty good .
It &apos;s got a right-@@ sl@@ ant loop , a core and a del@@ ta .
I &apos;ve been downlo@@ ading
You got to see this .
That &apos;s my go@@ at .
You sure ?
Ye@@ ah , the left horn is damaged , just like the one I found .
See there ?
H@@ ey , did you get l@@ atitude and long@@ itu@@ de within the met@@ ad@@ ata ?
Sorry . Hav@@ en &apos;t gotten that far yet .
I was getting a little excited !
That &apos;s right down the road from Walter Bur@@ ns &apos; property .
Well , maybe his neighb@@ or &apos;s got the rest of your bil@@ ly go@@ at .
And the nine millimeter
You think he killed Walter Bur@@ ns
I &apos;ll ask him when I get there .
I &apos;ll run the print .
All right .
Gas company &apos;s drilling right in his lap .
I checked out the owner of this place , Bill Gi@@ b@@ son .
No pri@@ ors . He &apos;s been here for 40 years .
His work card &apos;s on file .
Well , if his prints are on that box ,
It &apos;s not exactly a thri@@ ving enterprise .
I didn &apos;t see any li@@ vest@@ ock .
What do you got , Nick ?
No oil le@@ ak .
But he could &apos;ve fixed it by now .
Let &apos;s see if Mr. Gi@@ b@@ son &apos;s here .
Oh , and now you fol@@ ks
We only want to understand what &apos;s going on .
You want to understand ?
Let me show you .
I don &apos;t see any evidence of
I don &apos;t mean to ins@@ ult your intelligence ,
W@@ as@@ n &apos;t there a river in Ohio a long time ago
The Cu@@ y@@ ah@@ oga , just outside of Cle@@ vel@@ and .
You know , I had a c@@ ousin who lived there .
Gi@@ b@@ son and Bur@@ ns tried to do something about it .
Did you know they were both sick ?
L@@ ots of sick people in Cable Springs .
Have you seen your doctor recently ?
Ye@@ ah .
You can read about it in my article .
Which is coming out when ?
Unfortunately , all my sources keep dying on me .
And I &apos;m still missing one crucial piece of the puzzle .
Have you ever heard of &quot; Fra@@ cking &quot; ?
So@@ unds like a sci@@ -@@ fi exp@@ le@@ tive .
Look it up .
And then give me a call .
Very well .
I &apos;m not gon@@ na touch anything .
Good .
Those the results from the water samples ?
Ye@@ ah .
Hand &apos; em over .
I analyzed the sample we collected from Mr. Gi@@ b@@ son &apos;s well .
The sli@@ des confirm Walter Bur@@ ns
I pulled the clinical aut@@ op@@ sy reports
Because maybe .. they were drinking bad water .
This is the analysis from the water found
You see , it &apos;s the same tox@@ ins ,
So Walter Bur@@ ns
If these chemicals are in the water supply in Cable Springs ,
We need to war@@ n people .
And tell them what ?
A water sample from one well
I found it .
What ?
They drill until they hit gas@@ -@@ bearing sh@@ ale .
Then they pump millions of gall@@ ons of water , sand
This creates mini@@ ature earthqu@@ akes
So they &apos;re drilling right through the aqu@@ i@@ fer in Cable Springs ,
What happens to all the chemicals they put down the hole ?
Well , have a look at this .
The valve &apos;s loose , about a quarter turn .
Almost never happens without human intervention .
I think som@@ ebo@@ dy set up our tru@@ cker Co@@ dy Tri@@ m@@ ble
S@@ low le@@ ak . T@@ ire goes down .
Tri@@ m@@ ble gets out to fix his ti@@ re ,
And that takes care of Con@@ serv@@ o &apos;s only loose end .
This wasn &apos;t an accident .
Fir@@ ing one .
That &apos;s some blood on the lan@@ yard ring .
And what looks like some hair .
It &apos;s the same color as Walter Bur@@ ns &apos; hair .
I think we know what made Walter Bur@@ ns &apos; head wo@@ und .
So Bur@@ ns h@@ opp@@ ed the f@@ ence at Con@@ serv@@ o Solutions ,
But what he got was a Ber@@ etta to the head .
He dro@@ w@@ ned in that pool ,
Co@@ dy Tri@@ m@@ ble drove Walter &apos;s body out to the hot springs .
Which we confirmed by the blood we found in Co@@ dy &apos;s truck .
Right . So ...
a Con@@ serv@@ o Solutions tru@@ cker with no pri@@ ors
He then takes a hit for the home team ?
That &apos;s some serious company loyalty .
Thank you , gentlemen .
That &apos;s it . Case closed .
What ? Seri@@ ously ?
You &apos;re going to let some corporate law@@ yers
No . They &apos;re not telling you . I &apos;m telling you .
You got your evidence . You got the bad guy .
Justice has been served .
Well , we still need a water sample
For what ?
Because Walter Bur@@ ns dro@@ w@@ ned in
You don &apos;t need a sample ,
K@@ iller &apos;s dead .
But this has nothing to do with that show ,
Well , Leon@@ ard and Penn@@ y are our best friends .
They know us better than anyone .
They said it &apos;s the perfect gift .
We must be missing something .
You don &apos;t ..
think it &apos;s a mar@@ ital aid , do you ?
Don &apos;t be sil@@ ly .
A@@ my , how is this big glass shaft going to aid our marriage ?
Do you think when Kr@@ yp@@ to the Super@@ dog is out flying ,
H@@ mm . Hav@@ en &apos;t really thought about it before .
Rel@@ ax , H@@ an .
No@@ body &apos;s gon@@ na die
In fact , they &apos;re more likely to die
L@@ ate , and with an attitude .
You think you &apos;re too good for the din@@ er ?
Of course she thinks that .
I think sour@@ d@@ ough bread is too good for this din@@ er .
Well , what other career option do you have , Carol@@ ine ?
H@@ mm , let &apos;s see . C@@ up@@ cakes ?
No , wait , your shop didn &apos;t last six months .
Don &apos;t go there , H@@ an .
Oh , I &apos;m already there . And now I &apos;m back .
Why so m@@ oo@@ dy . H@@ an ?
You know we have to bury those mit@@ ts now .
And we have to tell them to stop
Prob@@ ably a 7-@@ 10 split .
And now they &apos;re not making noise .
It &apos;s like when you go to the zo@@ o ,
It &apos;s Max and Carol@@ ine .
Your ball came into our yard again .
Hi . Ye@@ ah , it &apos;s not a good time .
U@@ h , we &apos;re ro@@ le-@@ playing .
and , obviously , I &apos;m Be@@ y@@ once .
H@@ ey . J@@ ay Z ?
Look at all the single ladies .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah , baby .
J@@ ay Z and I have a lot in common .
He bought the Brooklyn N@@ ets .
I &apos;m not surprised that you &apos;re J@@ ay Z and Be@@ y@@ once ,
Where should I put this ?
Oh , well , I &apos;ll tell you what I told him .
Put it anywhere You want .
So that &apos;s basically our ball at this point .
Look , you two may be crazy in love ,
Cra@@ zy in love ?
Oh , come on . We &apos;re not in love .
I wouldn &apos;t say that &apos;s all we are .
Oh , no , you &apos;re right .
We also share a CV@@ S points reward card .
Is it really a reward if it comes from CV@@ S ?
Can &apos;t you two ever do it over at O@@ leg &apos;s apartment ?
Or are all the lan@@ es reserved ?
I have no idea where he lives .
Wa@@ it , you &apos;ve never been to O@@ leg &apos;s apartment ?
No , with my busy work schedule ,
You &apos;d be surprised by my apartment , S@@ ophie .
It &apos;s more than just the place
Ye@@ ah , well , That sounds nice .
I don &apos;t have access to the p@@ ills I need
Any advice or p@@ ills ?
Well , let &apos;s see . We are kind of like a family here ,
And you didn &apos;t use my college fund
And in my family ,
But if that didn &apos;t work ,
You know , what used to be known as good par@@ enting .
Come over tomorrow .
Carol@@ ine Will be at O@@ leg &apos;s .
We can get@@ -@@ st@@ oned and watch a movie .
The last time I was st@@ oned
Well , those wig@@ gle shows do get crazy .
Look at us , Max ,
Ye@@ ah , and where is my hom@@ ey ?
Oh , it &apos;s this way .
I can smell the AX@@ E body spray .
Now , what movie should we watch ?
I brought Sh@@ re@@ k , Sh@@ re@@ k 2 ,
Is there one where Sh@@ re@@ k has cancer ?
What are you guys doing here ?
What is Carol@@ ine doing here ?
You said she was going to be at O@@ leg &apos;s .
I am at O@@ leg &apos;s .
You guys live with O@@ leg ?
You told him this was our apartment ?
As a wise person once told me ,
I &apos;m not let@@ ting anyone leave
I don &apos;t understand .
Are we not smoking we@@ ed ?
Oh , I already did .
I don &apos;t know what his problem is .
He fired me for missing 20 minutes of work .
Why doesn &apos;t he fire himself for missing pu@@ ber@@ ty ?
Let it go , H@@ an .
She spent her morning du@@ sting a stra@@ p-@@ on .
I didn &apos;t fire you because you were late .
All right , well , apparently ,
and now this p@@ ig is as cold as your family is gon@@ na be
Ok@@ ay , this is bad .
My dad does not like to be por@@ k te@@ ased .
Well , maybe we can get a replacement p@@ ig .
I started hanging out at cir@@ cus bars until we met .
The attraction was immediate .
He was older , always in command of a room ,
We dated for six months .
He transformed me
And then , he suddenly disappeared .
No good@@ b@@ ye . No note .
Just some pe@@ an@@ ut sh@@ ells on the floor
I know it &apos;s st@@ up@@ id .
Not to mention the fact that Joe gets Cla@@ ire in the deal .
She &apos;s a fantastic mother .
R@@ uns a company , hell of a role model .
He could never do better than that for a mother .
You know what , Phi@@ l and Cla@@ ire have already raised their kids .
I think it &apos;s time for them to travel .
There .
That &apos;s where my disappear bag was hanging !
You have , like , a hundred missed calls from Gl@@ oria .
You have to come back right now .
Is everything ok@@ ay ?
What ?
There must be a bus stop nearby .
Until then , just act normal
Ok@@ ay , why are you whis@@ per@@ ing only part of a sentence ?
That &apos;s going to attract attention .
Re@@ ally ?
Me , obviously .
A@@ y , Mann@@ y , you &apos;re too young .
Besides , you &apos;re about to start your new life soon .
Ye@@ ah , you should be out sow@@ ing your o@@ ats
That &apos;s something you like .
I don &apos;t see what the big deal is .
I &apos;d hire a n@@ anny , sell the house , down@@ size to a con@@ do .
I &apos;m thinking maybe a lo@@ ft in an up-@@ and-@@ coming arts district .
S@@ ure , it &apos;ll take me a bit longer to finish college ,
The main thing is , he &apos;s my brother .
I &apos;m not let@@ ting any@@ body else raise him .
A@@ y . Mann@@ y . You &apos;re so sweet .
Am I the only one un@@ settled
Oh , we forgot to put the apple the new p@@ ig &apos;s mouth .
Oh , just leave it .
Now that &apos;s your answer to everything , isn &apos;t it ?
I des@@ erve that .
I was a f@@ ool to think I could get through this
Well , you broke my heart .
I just had to protect myself .
When we first met , you were just ...
pure , raw potential .
Your Mis@@ sour@@ i tw@@ ang .
The innocent way your shirt cu@@ ffs
We haven &apos;t heard from him since .
I &apos;m on it .
A reliable source told me where I can find him .
Call me when you have him .
I &apos;m not going to call you .
Just call me ! It &apos;s a simple extrac@@ tion .
Get Ru@@ iz out of there
I got this , D@@ ad !
You know me , I have a gentle touch .
Sh@@ it ! Not again .
What &apos;s up with the Cam@@ az@@ ot@@ z cra@@ p , hu@@ h ?
The B.@@ P.@@ R.@@ D. sends you down here ,
I miss you , man .
Come on , I &apos;m here to bring you back in .
Come on , bud@@ dy , let &apos;s go .
So come on , bring me in .
Ok@@ ay .
Ok@@ ay . H@@ ey , what happened to you , man ?
