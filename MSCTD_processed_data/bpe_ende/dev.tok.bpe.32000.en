Your pain is dramatic to me .

Everything hur@@ ts , all the time .
Ok@@ ay . Well , I &apos;m gon@@ na give you a quick exam ,

This doesn &apos;t feel real .
Does this feel real to you ?
No . I don &apos;t know .
Oh , cra@@ p .
Does your friend have any aller@@ gi@@ es ,
Is she on any medic@@ ation ?
She &apos;s not our friend .
Jas@@ mine ! we bar@@ ely know her .
We met her on the plane from sy@@ dney .
We &apos;re back@@ pac@@ king , seeing the states .
So we hardly know her .
We &apos;re just traveling mates .
She &apos;s really nice , though .
All right , let &apos;s move .
A nam@@ e. u@@ h , can you give me that ?
She &apos;s gon@@ na wake up in a lot of pain

And I am trying to just take a minute .
So , Der@@ ek , please ..
Back off .
You want a ride home ?
I was gon@@ na clean out his lo@@ cker ,
I was about as good a friend to him
I just .. I ... I abandoned him completely .
I-@@ I-@@ I just .. moved out
I don &apos;t understand .
And Dr. Web@@ ber said I should talk to you .
Mrs. O &apos;@@ Mal@@ ley , I didn &apos;t know him like you knew him .
I didn &apos;t know him long ,
He .. he was very fast on his feet ,
He had tremend@@ ous potential .
And ..
You know , he was imp@@ ati@@ ent .
He wanted to become better faster .
He wanted to save more lives .
He was good .
And he was thou@@ ght@@ ful and generous .
And I think in the end , I think ...
I think he was hero@@ ic and noble .
And I liked him very much .
And I think he gave you good reason
H@@ ey . I &apos;m , u@@ h , headed out .
I just wanted to say good@@ ni@@ gh@@ t. night .
You two know each other ?
Ye@@ ah . Dr. Web@@ ber and I go way back , hu@@ h ?
We worked together for , what was it , five , six years ?
Ye@@ ah . You know , I hate to say it ,
And this being a teaching hospital ,
So you know how to do s@@ ut@@ ures , right , Dr. M@@ ck@@ ee ?
Dam@@ n straight .
Great . Good seeing you , chief .
Look , do@@ c
It &apos;s , u@@ h , it &apos;s my eigh@@ th .

Thanks .

Thank you .
Are you really g@@ ay ?
Like , how g@@ ay are you ,

H@@ o ... how g@@ ay are you ?
Well , anyone else I can off@@ end ?
A te@@ ther@@ ed sp@@ inal cord ?
one of the th@@ reads in his sp@@ inal cord
Norm@@ ally the sp@@ inal cord is free at the end ,
Thus the exc@@ ru@@ ci@@ ating pain .
I &apos;ll s@@ ni@@ p the te@@ ther@@ ed cord and he &apos;ll be free of pain .
She &apos;s not normally like this .
Before all this , she was , like a normal mo@@ m .
Andy this is a normal mo@@ m .
Are we waiting for d@@ r . S@@ wen@@ der ?
No. dr@@ . s@@ wen@@ der has handed you off to me .
Wh@@ -@@ what are you , like , second year ?
Third .
Can we page dr@@ . s@@ wen@@ der or something ?
St@@ ev@@ ens this is a good thing .
It is .
You still have cancer ,
It is a good thing .
You died in my arms .
You fre@@ ak@@ in &apos; died and then you left instructions
You want to know what I &apos;m sc@@ ared of ?
I &apos;m sc@@ ared of everything !
I &apos;m sc@@ ared to move ! I &apos;m sc@@ ared to brea@@ the !
I &apos;m sc@@ ared to touch you !
I can &apos;t lose you . I won &apos;t survive .
And that &apos;s your fault .
You made me love you , you made me let you in ,
that &apos;s how you stay alive .
When it hur@@ ts so much you can &apos;t brea@@ the
Mir@@ anda .
By remember@@ ing that one day ,
The tri@@ ck was so sho@@ cking
I , u@@ h , don &apos;t think it &apos;s working .
Oh , well , I mean ,
You just move your ... Ye@@ ah .
.... arm around to keep it going .
I should probably get going .
Mother &apos;s waiting in the truck .
.. And she &apos;s patient until she isn &apos;t .
Oh , and I &apos;ve got to get to work , too ,
It &apos;s pretty hard to concentrate with all the bathroom cr@@ ying
Have a good one .
I will .
Wo@@ w . Those are nice .
Ye@@ ah , they were on the front por@@ ch .
They &apos;re from a mystery admir@@ er .
The card says , &quot; You don &apos;t know your power . &quot;
Ye@@ ah , don &apos;t ask who they &apos;re from ,
What happened to your arm ?
Oh , I am win@@ ding an old watch
Oh . That &apos;s pretty un@@ even . You gave her this a@@ wesome swing .
Man , where did mo@@ m find a guy as sweet as you ?
Actually , she hit me with her car
We may not get women ,
We may not h@@ ook up with women ,
I think it was clear when I said that .
So , what &apos;s with this whole &quot; going out early &quot; thing .
Well , it &apos;s been forever since we &apos;ve had a dat@@ e-@@ night out ,
U@@ gh , pa@@ thetic .
Ok@@ ay , we get to say that , not you .
No , no , no , it &apos;s D@@ yl@@ an .
He texts me every Valentine &apos;s day beg@@ ging to h@@ ook up .
Oh , that is sad .
I know . It almost never works .
All right , you old bags ,
S@@ al , what are you doing here ?
It &apos;s Valentine &apos;s day and my
The first part &apos;s true .
Well , actually , we have plans .
A@@ w , but now you have better plans .
Ms. Clar@@ ke , sorry for the trouble .
May I have that back ?
Oh , my gos@@ h . I &apos;m sorry .
I didn &apos;t know that real humans could have these dimensions .
Thanks .
Thank you .
I seem to have dropped my spare hotel key .
Phi@@ l
No need to call wh@@ o@@ ever this Phi@@ l is .
You &apos;re in no danger .
This key is to room 4@@ 22 at the Ram@@ ada down the street .
Sli@@ p out when you can .
I &apos;ll pre-@@ dis@@ able the smoke det@@ ectors
For the past several Valentine &apos;s ,
This hotel has a very short memory
Cla@@ ire , you have to finish signing these contracts .
H@@ ey , Phi@@ l .
Phi@@ l ? No .
Name &apos;s C@@ live , friend .
S@@ ay , maybe you could take over here for a bit .
I &apos;ll make sure the b@@ oss lady &apos;s back in one piece
Hi , Phi@@ l .
It &apos;s C@@ live , actually .
Appar@@ ently they have a thing like how you and your sister
Oh . U@@ h , Cla@@ ire , your 2 : 00 is here
Phi@@ l , look , I really appreciate this . I do .
It &apos;s just that
Tur@@ ns out my admir@@ er
I may have a sad love life , but I don &apos;t need my m@@ omm@@ y
And if you really want to give me some confidence ,
First of all , I didn &apos;t give you those flowers .
Second of all , there is a picture of you .
Where is it ?
Yes , h@@ ello .
I &apos;ve got a meeting .
Ben , you &apos;re gon@@ na finish the contract stuff .
Margaret , you &apos;re gon@@ na take Alex .
You &apos;re gon@@ na find out who &apos;s using our account for flowers , ok@@ ay ?
Phi@@ l , honey ,
Do I know that guy in the clo@@ ak ?
Ah , hin@@ ge specialist . You might &apos;ve seen him around .
He &apos;s the guy for off@@ beat swi@@ v@@ els
I &apos;ve got it all planned .
This whole C@@ live thing wasn &apos;t even necessary .
Cla@@ ire was taking me out to dinner all along .
Rom@@ ance strong as ever .
Margaret , get a reservation
I &apos;ve got too much going on to even think about it .
Werner is great .
You know , he &apos;s a rich musician ,
Well , um ...
... This has been fun , but we should , u@@ h ...
You &apos;re not going anywhere , car@@ rot bottom .
Oh , my god . Is that Rainer ?
Why is he with another woman ?
That sounds che@@ at-@@ y .
H@@ ey . Margaret said you keep the phone records .
Why ? What do you need them for ?
I &apos;m still trying to find out who sent me those flowers .
You keep them in here ?
No , don &apos;t .
Don &apos;t .
Ben , why do you have this photo of me in your desk dra@@ wer ?
Who would bul@@ ly you ?
So , I heard there was going to be this big ice-@@ sk@@ ating party .
Oh , my God . It &apos;s already gotten , like , eight likes .
Despite our failure in Russia ,
They believe H@@ ass@@ an had been working with this man ,
He &apos;s a French national who &apos;s been trading illegal arms
Victor has recently stepp@@ ed up his game into the nuclear arena
For years , he &apos;s worked hand in hand with his brother , David .
There were reports of a power struggle between the two .
David didn &apos;t want his brother
Later he was almost captured by police ,
Oh , that poor lady . Does anyone know if she &apos;s OK ?
She &apos;s fine .
If Mar@@ qu@@ ez finds those plans and s@@ ells them to Az@@ ar ... B@@ oom !
Our mission ? Take down Mar@@ qu@@ ez before he can locate the plans .
Do we know his wher@@ e@@ ab@@ outs ?
N@@ SA believes he &apos;s headed to Berlin to meet with Az@@ ar .
Yes ! Love Berlin .
Christ@@ ina , you &apos;ll take it .
We also have int@@ el from MI@@ 6 .
That doesn &apos;t give me the right to dis@@ semin@@ ate it freely .
Come on . Look , the letter was found in Bern@@ ad@@ ette &apos;s clos@@ et .
Do@@ esn &apos;t that count for something ?
Are you pointing out that California
Ye@@ ah , obviously .
Well played .
Sometimes I don &apos;t give you enough credit , Penn@@ y .
Well , put your mind at ease .
I &apos;m here to make sure your dinner party
Now , the first thing we need is a theme .
I &apos;m thinking ...
ah , tur@@ n-@@ of-the-@@ century Mou@@ lin Rou@@ ge .
I &apos;m thinking you need a test@@ oster@@ one patch .
Penn@@ y and I just want to do something low-@@ key .
You know , cock@@ tails ,
So your theme is
H@@ ate to miss that .
H@@ ey , where have you been ?
Oh , Leon@@ ard .
If I was pr@@ one to sar@@ cas@@ m ,
One , two , three , four , five ,
I meant , &quot; Gol@@ ly , Shel@@ don ,
They made me reveal confidenti@@ al information
What information ?
I can &apos;t tell you that .
I am bound by clos@@ et
Well , come on , we won &apos;t tell anyone .
Qu@@ e ser@@ a . That &apos;s racing , I gu@@ ess .
It &apos;s bad luck for the p@@ unter@@ s that they lose their money .
Fu@@ cking hell !
Ru@@ u@@ ck !
Na@@ than , how are you going ?
I &apos;m al@@ right . I &apos;ve just ... . just got a flat .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah . Need a hand ?
N@@ ah , all good . I got it .
No wor@@ ries at all , m@@ ate .
She &apos;s given up on your whole pa@@ thetic act .
Do you know that you &apos;re the la ..
En@@ ough .
Why don &apos;t you and your dead@@ beat husband
Jack , you &apos;re my brother .
I can &apos;t just stand by and watch this happen .
Are you done ?
Have you made that call ?
What you &apos;re talking about is a one-@@ way street . You understand ?
Once you start , there is no going back .
She &apos;s had fair warning .
She knew the consequences and she did it anyway .
So fu@@ ck her .
You want my money or not ?
Do you have that sort of cash just lying around ?
About . $ 250@@ ,000 .
Quar@@ ter of a million dollars .
And you just forgot about it ?
We didn &apos;t have to kill her , did we ?
What are you talking about ? !
We could have used that money to pay Bruce .
By the time I found it , we were already committed .
Very convenient .
Belie@@ ve me , there is nothing convenient
H@@ ey .
I &apos;m sick and tired of having bar@@ ely enough .
I want more .
So should you .
I &apos;m Off
Maybe .
Your business is your own .
As long as we &apos;re square .
You got some proof for me ?
Or am I supposed to just take your word ?
What , you don &apos;t trust me anymore ?
I &apos;d have thought you &apos;d be glad to be rid of her .
Answer to all your problems .
Despite what you think ,
To@@ o much .
Well , you &apos;ve got a crazy way of showing it .
No@@ body makes a f@@ ool out of me .
It &apos;s gone .
I don &apos;t i@@ ke the sound of that .
Alice .
You wouldn &apos;t be playing games with me , would you , Jack ?
W@@ ha@@ c
At the safety deposit box at the bank .
ad me wor@@ ried for a moment .
What time shall I come back tomorrow
Jet &apos;s make it 200 .
Jack , all this talk of boo@@ ze has got me quite thir@@ sty .
You wouldn &apos;t know of any good bars in the area , would you ?
Sh@@ it .
Hi , Bruce .
Where &apos;s Lu@@ cy ?
Oh , she has@@ n &apos;t showed up for work yet .
You know why I &apos;m here ?
I &apos;m here on police business .
You know anything about a crash ?
Up on De@@ vil &apos;s Ro@@ cks Road ?
No . Should T
I found Lu@@ cy &apos;s car , or what &apos;s left of it .
This thing has insurance job written all over it .
So , how are we gon@@ na do this ?
Well , that &apos;s the easy part .
You just put the money on the ground
Hot a chance .
We do this fac@@ e-@@ to-@@ face or not at all
I &apos;ll keep the memory card
Over my dead body .
Is@@ n &apos;t that over your wife &apos;s dead body ?
You go to hell !
You &apos;ve got a bad attitude .
You don &apos;t really notice any of the sc@@ ars .
Of course , she &apos;s fat@@ ter than my el@@ eph@@ ant
Well , the years can be cru@@ el , Howard .
&quot; Life is n@@ asty , bru@@ tish and short , &quot; as the man said .
Was it Hob@@ bes ? :
I &apos;d have got on rather well with Hob@@ bes .
Sh@@ all we go for a drink ?
The Cat@@ ledge family are wonderful people
They &apos;re a weal@@ thy Pitt@@ s@@ burgh family .
T@@ Father made millions in coal before he died
Now , the thing is , there &apos;s a young woman staying with them ,
Oh , Lord , not another f@@ ake psych@@ ic .
What a p@@ esti@@ l@@ ence they are .
They &apos;re taken with her predic@@ tions of the future .
T@@ elling them what they want to hear . Prec@@ isely .
H@@ mm , and charging them for all the good news she brings .
Ex@@ ac@@ tly right . And , of course , she &apos;s a pretty young thing
Bri@@ ce Cat@@ ledge , Carol@@ ine &apos;s brother ,
Bri@@ ce Cat@@ ledge &apos;s sister Carol@@ ine
Oh , rub@@ b@@ ish .
Do@@ esn &apos;t he know that scientists are among the easi@@ est to f@@ ool ?
Well , this is the thing , I &apos;m embar@@ rass@@ ed to say ,
I mean , I wat@@ ched every move , and Lord knows ,
I began to doubt my own clear thinking
Oli@@ via and I were all set to take a holiday ,
But you hate holidays .
You &apos;ll spend your whole time in your room practic@@ ing card tri@@ cks ,
And besides , you &apos;ve always loved the south of France ,
But if this woman knows she &apos;s being wat@@ ched by the great W@@ ei L@@ ing So@@ o ,
The usual head@@ aches , resistance in the room .
She &apos;ll never know you &apos;re W@@ ei L@@ ing So@@ o .
Don &apos;t get angry with me , Oli@@ via . It won &apos;t be for long
You &apos;ve always had the measure of me , Oli@@ via .
E@@ ver since our very first dinner ,
Yes , you were very impressive .
Oh , it was simply a matter of logic and common sense .
J@@ itt@@ le Howard
Of all my ne@@ ph@@ e@@ ws and ni@@ eces , you &apos;re the only one , Stanley ,
Oh , I couldn &apos;t agree more .
If only you had a slightly mil@@ der disp@@ osition ,
Oh , I am his friend . Notice I use the sing@@ ular .
Yes , he means he can toler@@ ate me .
George , Carol@@ ine , Stanley . How do you do ?
Oh , h@@ ello . Stanley .
A great pleasure .
George . Char@@ med .
Of course , George and Carol@@ ine are the reason I &apos;m here .
They &apos;re a great deal less g@@ ul@@ li@@ ble
When she fo@@ ol@@ ed Howard Bur@@ kan ,
I don &apos;t know if Howard told you , her name is S@@ ophie B@@ aker .
Have you heard of her or ...
No , I have not , but these sle@@ az@@ y fr@@ au@@ d@@ sters change identity every month .
And I om@@ itted to mention she &apos;s here with her mother .
Ah , now , that says a lot . Ye@@ ah .
Carol@@ ine , you were next to her .
She held my brother &apos;s hand , and she actually made the table rise .
Well , I looked for the usual devices , of course .
I thought maybe , wr@@ ist li@@ fts , but they weren &apos;t there .
She &apos;s promised to try and make contact with my father ,
As I was saying , your mother and your brother
There is , of course , no spirit world , and even if there were ,
And , u@@ h , how long will you be staying with us , M@@ ister .
Oh , not very . I have business elsewhere .
Ah , have you told him about S@@ ophie ?
Ah , now , is this the girl that can read minds and such ?
Well , she gets these sens@@ ory impressions . And , what are they ?
It &apos;s hard to explain . She gets these mental vibr@@ ations .
Her head vibr@@ ates ?
Drink ? Thank you .
Have you got a whis@@ key , Bri@@ ce ? I absolutely do .
Now , S@@ ophie looked into my eyes
About old girl@@ friends I &apos;d had ,
Good heav@@ ens . You think she can do it with me ?
Oh , of course . Of course .
S@@ ophie sees all .
She can predic@@ t the future . In short , she &apos;s a vision@@ ary .
And , I &apos;m told she &apos;s very pleasant to look at .
She &apos;s a vision@@ ary and a vision .
Mother &apos;s agreed to subsidi@@ ze a foundation
Oh , she &apos;s nothing I haven &apos;t seen before .
Pre@@ t@@ ty young thing with a stage mother who hand@@ les the promotion ,
I want you to see her working
Well , I mean , she &apos;s not even a good actress .
&quot; I ... I get the impression of the Ori@@ ent . China . &quot;
Well , I thought that was quite good ,
Yes , it &apos;s all very t@@ ant@@ alizing
And yet , she &apos;s a fraud , Howard .
Because there is no sixth sense .
There are five senses , and no spirit world .
U@@ h , yes , I had a bath . I had a little n@@ ap .
And now , you &apos;re refres@@ h@@ ed .
Well , no , not entirely . I had an un@@ pleasant dream .
I &apos;ve had my share .
I dre@@ amt I was being followed by a sin@@ ister Chinese .
You have the Far East on the brain .
What do you think it means ? I don &apos;t know .
Good evening .
What ? Oh , I was just ..
I was receiving some mental impressions . Exc@@ use me .
Come , Stanley , let &apos;s go to ... You look st@@ un@@ ned .
I had an unc@@ le who dro@@ w@@ ned many years ago .
And when I mentioned him ,
There &apos;s absolutely no way she could know that unless
I once raised a real tiger , but we both have our tri@@ cks .
There was nothing supporting this cand@@ le , no th@@ reads , no wir@@ es ,
I ... I was just telling Mr. Pep@@ per@@ id@@ ge here
&quot; Appar@@ ent , &quot; I think , is the key word .
Is it &quot; Pep@@ per@@ id@@ ge , &quot; or &quot; Tal@@ mu@@ dge , &quot; or &quot; Tap@@ l@@ inger ? &quot;
I mean , I grab@@ bed the cand@@ le and found absolutely nothing supporting it .
That &apos;s because there &apos;s nothing to find .
There is no met@@ aph@@ ysi@@ cal world .
What you see out there is what you get .
I think Mr. Ni@@ etz@@ sche has dispos@@ ed of the God matter rather convinc@@ ingly .
Good morning .
M@@ mm .
What are you doing today ?
I &apos;m going bir@@ d-@@ watching with Bri@@ ce .
Do you want to join us ?
I can &apos;t think of a more in@@ ane activity ,
Why don &apos;t you join me instead ?
Where ?
She &apos;s a remarkable woman .
We could have lunch . Chat ?
Actually , get to know one another better .
You think you &apos;ll tri@@ ck me into showing you how I dec@@ eive people .
Come on .
I &apos;m sure Bri@@ ce Cat@@ ledge can live
Tell me , doesn &apos;t it ever trouble your conscience
I could just as easily ask you ,
Not if their hopes are false .
Even if their hopes are false ,
Then you admit you &apos;re a fraud ?
I wonder if you get your c@@ yn@@ ic@@ ism from your grand@@ father ,
The missing toe .
Why are you star@@ ing at me ?
Where are you from ?
Any other way , lies ma@@ dness .
You &apos;d be happ@@ ier if I was a fraud ,
No , it &apos;s quite the opposite .
If you knew how much I don &apos;t want you to be a f@@ ake .
Oh , but think how embar@@ rass@@ ing it would be for you .
Is that why J@@ enny dropped you ?
How could you know about J@@ enny ?
I see long , blonde hair .
A wonderful lau@@ gh .
Yes , she had a lovely lau@@ gh .
But who wants a p@@ essi@@ mis@@ tic b@@ ore
CEO gets indic@@ ted for fr@@ au@@ d.@@ Invest@@ ors start losing money .
L@@ ots of money .
If I didn &apos;t know Bur@@ rows pulled that trigger ,
We &apos;re talking half a billion dollars .
People have killed for a lot less .
Not a good position you find yourself in , is it ?
Wh@@ ites don &apos;t want you . Bl@@ acks don &apos;t want you .
You &apos;re just caught in the middle , aren &apos;t you ?
Maybe you are in no position to be telling me my business . H@@ m ?
That &apos;s what I thought .
I &apos;m sure you can understand my rel@@ uc@@ t@@ ance to discuss past patients .
absolutely .
I &apos;m not acc@@ ustom@@ ed to making en@@ qu@@ iries like this , but I ..
I feel like I can get through to him .
I can help him .
I imagine he needs it in there .
What did you treat him for ?
Michael suffered from a couple of things .
One was a condition called low lat@@ ent in@@ hibition .
Sorry . I &apos;m not familiar with the term .
People who suffer from low lat@@ ent in@@ hibition see everyday things like you or I do
But where we just process the image of a lamp ,
The stem , the bul@@ b , the bol@@ ts , even the wash@@ ers inside .
Their bra@@ ins are more open to in@@ coming stim@@ uli in the surrounding environment .
Other people &apos;s bra@@ ins
We have to do it in order to keep our san@@ ity .
If someone with a low I@@ Q has low lat@@ ent in@@ hibition ,
Do you think Michael &apos;s a gen@@ ius ?
He came to me with absolutely no sense of self-@@ worth .
The loss of both parents very often does that to a child .
But with the low lat@@ ent in@@ hibition ,
He became very att@@ un@@ ed to all the suffering around him .
He couldn &apos;t shut it out .
He became a res@@ cu@@ er ,
I didn &apos;t know all this about him .
I hope you don &apos;t mind ,
If &apos;s in my nature to want to help .
From what I understand it &apos;s in your nature too .
You did a lot of good things before you were in here .
L@@ ot community work , lot charity work .
What happened ?
The man you &apos;re talking about died the moment I stepp@@ ed inside these walls .
All right .
Ladies and gentlemen , United States Secret Service .
Don &apos;t you talk to your guy friends about sex ?
Who ? A@@ very ? No .
Well , you don &apos;t talk about
Maybe .
So you can do it with me .
Ok@@ ay , fine . Your work &apos;s suffering so bad ,
Ah , and yet you find inspiration in t@@ ooth@@ paste .
Maybe next time , you keep it to yourself .
That works for you ?
In a marriage ? Yes . You keep your mouth shut .
Although , u@@ h , kin@@ da ... Mir@@ anda &apos;s been , u@@ h ,
She has what , u@@ h , if you squ@@ int real hard ,
B@@ ail@@ ey ?
Ye@@ ah , she had that incident with the hole in the glo@@ ves .
I knew it fre@@ aked her out , but I was away .
I didn &apos;t know how much it fre@@ aked her out .
Just ap@@ ologi@@ ze , we feel terrible ,
She &apos;ll be p@@ iss@@ y , but she &apos;ll get over it .
Well , I could have Ed@@ wards tell her .
She &apos;s on her service .
Even better .
Ye@@ ah .
I need to put a g@@ astro@@ -@@ j on the schedule .
And if I tell Grey she can &apos;t get into the O.@@ R. until 7 : 00 ,
That means I have to work late .
You &apos;ll be working late any@@ how
And to the people who count on you for support .
All right , all right , I will take it .
Thank you .
And K@@ ep@@ ner invited me to her wedding .
Did she ?
Plus one .
And you &apos;re gon@@ na be invited ... plus one .
Is she , like , exp@@ ecting us to bring other people ?
No , bri@@ des are wei@@ rd . Go think about something else .
Please ?
Ok@@ ay .
Is he gon@@ na make it ?
Well , if Yang can get her act together .
Come with me .
Please .
That &apos;s Na@@ than . He &apos;s a real baby .
We &apos;re not talking about me . We &apos;re talking about him .
That &apos;s Ash@@ ley , his mo@@ m .
He has a very nice father .
This isn &apos;t a study , Mer@@ edi@@ th .
This is a baby .
Na@@ than is the first one in his family ,
I mean , he &apos;s a baby .
Have you lost your mind ?
Do you think that because I have kids ,
No , I
Now you want me to shut down my entire study ,
Baby Na@@ than and all of his college potential ,
I ap@@ ologi@@ ze . I &apos;ll be over here .
You don &apos;t have to actually date the woman she cho@@ oses .
I don &apos;t w@@ anna date any woman !
That &apos;s why she &apos;s doing this , St@@ an .
I thought you were gon@@ na talk her out of it .
You need to tell her yourself .
You &apos;re both putting me in the middle .
Because she li@@ stens to you .
She doesn &apos;t listen to anyone !
Besides , this is not such a terrible idea .
I &apos;m not a child she has to arrange day@@ care for !
A b@@ unch of women she sc@@ ared up on the internet ?
This is .. it &apos;s aw@@ ful .
It &apos;s taking her mind off what &apos;s actually happening .
That can &apos;t be the worst thing in the world .
She thinks she can find someone to replace her ?
You can &apos;t ... replace her .
No@@ body can possibly replace .. her .
Why ?
Why is this happening ?
If we &apos;re gon@@ na do this thing , we got@@ ta do it now .
I can &apos;t . I don &apos;t have a con@@ du@@ it to put in him .
It won &apos;t be done for another six hours .
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s gon@@ na last that long .
Ok@@ ay .
Ok@@ ay , let &apos;s put him on an os@@ c@@ ill@@ ator .
That &apos;s not your lunch , Shel@@ don ;
As they were incorrectly s@@ lic@@ ed ,
Is@@ n &apos;t tomorrow your usual laundry night ?
The supermarket was out of my regular fabric sof@@ tener .
If this one under@@ -@@ or over-@@ sof@@ tens ,
That &apos;s thinking ahead .
The alternative would be to think back@@ wards .
That &apos;s just remember@@ ing .
So how &apos;s A@@ my ?
A@@ my &apos;s changed .
I might have to let her go .
Oh , no . Why ?
I thought she was a highly evol@@ ved cre@@ ature
But recent events indicate that
we have to go outside .
No , it &apos;s chil@@ ly outside . Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t bring my jacket .
Oh , for cr@@ ying out loud .
What kind of super@@ hero needs a jacket ?
What kind of super@@ hero says , &quot; Di@@ bs on the red ti@@ ghts !
Di@@ bs on the red ti@@ ghts ! &quot;
Wa@@ it . Are we starting now ? Or is that what you &apos;re going to say
I &apos;m hanging up .
You got a number for a c@@ ab ?
Any@@ thing I can do ?
B@@ et I got you beat .
For worst day ever .
There &apos;s no way you could beat this one .
What , did your dog die or something ?
Happy birthday !
Ye@@ ah , 23 &apos;s kind of a big one .
Ye@@ ah , after the flood wash@@ ed it away .
You know , food for the wor@@ ms ?
You &apos;ve never heard of the Black@@ water flood ?
20-@@ something years ago ?
It was the end , all right .
There is no River &apos;s Ed
same as your house .
Un@@ less you like old wi@@ ves &apos; t@@ ales .
Well , y@@ e@@ ah , I might like them .
Don &apos;t sho@@ vel that sh@@ it to these kids , Lu@@ cky .
There &apos;s one story that says that house is still standing
If you believe stories for idi@@ ots and mor@@ ons .
You got some kind of de@@ ed ?
What do you mean ?
It &apos;s a long shot , but we m@@ apped something a few days
This is the old highway where the flood took it out .
See this path through the forest ?
Some@@ thing big definitely came through here .
Like it &apos;s holding on , just for me .
Stop right there .
Now turn around and walk away .
Look , don &apos;t get the wrong idea .
We &apos;re , u@@ h , Public Land and Survey .
Who used to live here ?

He didn &apos;t say anything !
What did you say to him ?
Get the fu@@ ck off of him .
Look , I do not know what &apos;s going on , OK ?
Did he say something to you or not ?
They don &apos;t even fu@@ cking walk u@@ pri@@ ght .
Ye@@ ah , well , they know how to throw a fu@@ cking ax@@ e .
He &apos;s running something illegal out of that house .
Or he &apos;s just some h@@ ill@@ bil@@ ly lun@@ atic who thinks the state &apos;s
Oh my god !
Oh , sh@@ it !
Stop !
No one lives here , Ev@@ ie , OK ?
Trust me , no one .
Is any@@ body else thinking what I &apos;m thinking ?
Forest , ra@@ vine , car ?
So the car could still be sitting there ?
Well , should we try and see ?
Come on , we &apos;d never make it by dark .
And Ev@@ ie can &apos;t make it anywhere right now .
Well , I would rather go into the woods than stay inside
Oh , in the same woods where they mur@@ dered Sam ?
We don &apos;t need to broadcast ourselves .
How am I the only one that thinks this is a bad idea ?
H@@ ey , h@@ ey , h@@ ey , h@@ ey , h@@ ey .
There is no way that I &apos;m staying in there .
Stop it .
Look at me , OK ?

How long was I out ?

His name is Alfred , and , yes , he does .
There , perfect .
What , are you sure ?
It &apos;s my first pro@@ m , I want to do it correctly .
I thought you were gon@@ na pre@@ tend to be an alien .
I was , but Penn@@ y didn &apos;t want to .
You didn &apos;t want to .
Bern@@ ad@@ ette , A@@ my ,
And even I knew it was wei@@ rd to hire som@@ ebo@@ dy .

And there &apos;s a great deal of pressure
What pressure ?
All I said was you look hand@@ some .
Can you please open the door ?
It &apos;s not just that .
Leon@@ ard and Penn@@ y also made comments about it .
And I &apos;m not blind .
Even I looked twice when I saw my post@@ eri@@ or
So , I met Je@@ anie at your A@@ unt Gl@@ ad@@ ys &apos; .
She passed me the Man@@ isch@@ ew@@ itz ,
Is this what I sound like when I talk about India ?
So , my mother &apos;s ok@@ ay with this ?
Why would your mother have a problem with me and Stu@@ art ?
Because they have a wei@@ rd , in@@ appropriate relationship .
You worry about getting your ass back in that seat in time .
If you pull this off , you can come up to my room later ..
and the word &quot; no &quot; won &apos;t be in my voc@@ abul@@ ary .
Just make sure we get paid .
In and out .
You know I can &apos;t get into that .
Now , we &apos;ve been negoti@@ ating this for months .
I &apos;ve j@@ ump@@ ed through all your ho@@ ops .
I &apos;ve agreed to meet you here .
Do you want to sell the card to me or not ?
Be right back .
That &apos;s a lot of secrets on a little piece of plastic .
Let me give you a little bit of advice .
And this is on the house .
Watch your step with that thing .
The Company will do anything to get it back .
Don &apos;t I know it .
The Al@@ lies spent two and a half years ...
Planning the invasion of Nor@@ mand@@ y .
But on D-@@ Day it came down to a hand@@ ful of men ..
On a strip of beach ..
To decide the fate of the world .
What I &apos;m getting at , Gre@@ tchen ..
Is even the best plan is only as good ..
As the moving parts on the ground exec@@ uting it .
MS : I have info on S@@ ara .
Michael
It &apos;s good to see you .
So where &apos;s your new best friend ?
I don &apos;t know about that .
But W@@ hi@@ st@@ ler &apos;s not who you think he is .
We &apos;re working together against the Company .
You kept your word to me .
You &apos;re the first that &apos;s ever done that . Gra@@ ci@@ as .
Why must you go after this man ?
You could choose not to .
Where I come from , there &apos;s something called a blood feu@@ d .
Yes .
Michael Sco@@ field left me for dead ...
One too many times , as it turns out .
What is Spanish for &quot; little angel &quot; ?
Angel@@ ita .
He was an independent contrac@@ tor .
Who worked for the Company for about ten years .
He was assigned to retri@@ eve S@@ cy@@ lla once it went missing .
Do you know what S@@ cy@@ lla is ?
It &apos;s the Company &apos;s little black book .
So he was going to make a copy of it and give it to me .
What do you want from me ?
You &apos;re looking at major time .
You know that , right ?
So how would you like to walk away from it al ..
not do a day ?
All right . S@@ ara Tan@@ cre@@ di , last seen in Panama .
If you help me find her ..
Maybe we &apos;ve got a deal .
I &apos;m sorry , she &apos;s not my department , S@@ cy@@ lla is .
Then go find it yourself .
It seems to me ..
The U.S. government should have a little more reach ..
Get me back to the land &apos; o cotton .
Of course .
Re@@ ady .
Only a few people in government will know of the operation .
It has to stay that way ...
Or people &apos;s lives will be in danger , mine included .
T@@ aking down the company sounds a little bit more than a two-@@ man job , no ?
I &apos;m going to get you help .
I thought you said , you couldn &apos;t trust any@@ body .
Ye@@ ah , but maybe you can .
All right , two of your co@@ h@@ orts ..
Fern@@ ando Su@@ c@@ re , and Bra@@ d Bel@@ lick were arrested .
They &apos;re both facing time .
And Alexander Mah@@ one is in a Colorado j@@ ail cell .
Good , let him sit there .
He was working with W@@ hi@@ st@@ ler .
And you &apos;ll have me .
Ok@@ ay ? Wh@@ atever you need , I &apos;ll provide .
W@@ hi@@ st@@ ler also said something about a second step ,
Ye@@ ah , the card has all the data on it .
But it &apos;s encryp@@ ted .
I don &apos;t know .
So , we &apos;ve got a data card , which could be anywhere .
And we &apos;ve got to break into a building ...
The location of which has yet to be determined .
Simple enough .
How do you know our dad ?
He heard from contacts that I could be trusted .
Your father was a good man .
Why now ?
Look , I &apos;ve been going after the Company for five years .
Ok@@ ay ? When W@@ hi@@ st@@ ler was killed yesterday ...
The plug was going to be pulled on the entire operation .
But , u@@ h ..
I convinced my su@@ peri@@ ors to give it one more chance .
So this is like job security for you ?
Well , when we go out there and risk our nec@@ ks ..
You can collect your pension .
No , no , no , Lincoln .
Ok@@ ay , some people still care about their job .
Some people still fight for this country .
Maybe you &apos;ve been a little too dist@@ rac@@ ted ..
You can look for S@@ ara , if she &apos;s alive .
If we take this deal , we &apos;ll both be dead ...
Long before I get the chance . Lin@@ c .
You guys must have some big@@ -@@ time friends .
What are you talking about ?
Som@@ ebo@@ dy just posted ...
And there are some things ...
You can &apos;t hide .
K@@ now what I mean ?
How high is your threshold for pain ?
You sure you don &apos;t want a se@@ d@@ ative ?
We &apos;re gon@@ na go into the night .
How do you feel ?
Ligh@@ ter somehow .
Look , I don &apos;t know how we &apos;re gon@@ na take them down .
I don &apos;t even know who they are .
But I do know one thing ...
But you can guarantee it &apos;ll be the federal , supre@@ max .
No more updates .
Call me when they are dead .
Welcome to Los ang@@ les .
As it turns out , Men who have escap@@ ed not one ..
And stay off the Company &apos;s ra@@ dar .
You need to keep your heads down and your ears open .
We &apos;ve provided cell phones , clothing , and toiletries .
All the basic nec@@ essi@@ ties to get you up and running .
You pat@@ ted these guys down before you let them in , right ?
His suit , you don &apos;t buy a suit like that ..
On a co@@ p &apos;s sal@@ ary or pul@@ ling weekend gig@@ s as a driver .
That means he &apos;s full-@@ time .
He &apos;s highly paid .
You ask our friend Mr. Sel@@ f to run tax records .
In Los Angeles drawing a military pension ..
And taking six figures from a private security company ..
And you narrow your field from 10 million till about 50 .
And then I can pick the guy out from there .
Find the driver , you find the Card@@ holder .
Mexican Desert , 60 miles south of US border .
We haven &apos;t ate or d@@ rank anything for days .
Oh , I don &apos;t want to die out here .
We ain &apos;t gon@@ na die , San@@ cho .
Tell you what .
Why don &apos;t we rest here for a while , hu@@ h ?
Travel at night when it &apos;s cool@@ er .
S@@ i , that sounds good .
What are we gon@@ na do when we get there ?
To San Diego .
You mean after Michael pays ..
Will only last so long .
What does that mean ?
I mean , then what if som@@ ebo@@ dy finds out we &apos;re not .
What if we don &apos;t have to be in the house ?
If the card , this S@@ cy@@ lla is so important .
Maybe the guy is carrying it on him .
Well , according to public records .
And he &apos;s a CEO of a company called Spec@@ tro@@ le@@ um .
Heavy h@@ itter like that &apos;s gon@@ na have security 24-@@ 7 .
And we got@@ ta get this thing ..
Without anyone knowing it &apos;s gone , right ?
So even if he &apos;s got it on him , how do we get it off him ?
You don &apos;t ste@@ al the card .
You copy it .
Oh , now you &apos;re interested in what I got@@ ta say , right ?
Cop@@ ying it will make it harder .
Not only do you have to ste@@ al it .
You have to return it , gen@@ ius .
Only if you don &apos;t got me , hom@@ bre .
What &apos;s that ?
This is the reason I got bu@@ sted .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah , y@@ e@@ ah , no .
I &apos;m looking at federal time cause I st@@ ole a cell phone , seriously ?
I invented this
It looks like a cell phone but it &apos;s really like ...
A digital black hole .
Wireless hard drive that swal@@ lows up any electronic data ...
Within ten feet of it .
Like what ?
Like the account info ..
Of anyone at St@@ arb@@ u@@ cks with a lat@@ te and a laptop .
Like the P@@ IN number of any credit card used at a gas pump .
I can walk out of here and get the identi@@ ties .
And financial statements of ten people in ten minutes ...
On a slow day , with one hand on my j@@ unk .
And the information embedded in S@@ cy@@ lla ?
If we can get close enough ...
It &apos;s ours .
Just a matter of whether you do it before or after ..
I sh@@ ame you in front of your cow@@ or@@ kers here .
Tell me where the Company keeps the box , Jas@@ per .
C@@ ould be anywhere , I don &apos;t know .
Som@@ ebo@@ dy does .
Right ?
Som@@ ebo@@ dy that you might have access to .
You know , if you go down this road .
Your government job won &apos;t protect you .
Then I better not get caught , right ?
If I don &apos;t find something to eat soon .
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m gon@@ na do .
We &apos;re not gon@@ na make it .
We just got to keep talking . San@@ cho .
Keep our bra@@ ins focused on something other than ..
Our empty bel@@ lies and our dry mou@@ ths , ok@@ ay ?
Come on .
Let &apos;s start with , u@@ h , your@@ -@@ your favorite color .
I &apos;m hung@@ ry , T@@ eddy .
Why should the both of us die out here .
When one of us could help the other one survive ?
You don &apos;t want to do this . Please .
I &apos;ll make it quick . I promise !
San@@ cho .
Why &apos;d you have to go and do something so@@ s
It must be in there , right ?
Look , there &apos;s no way we &apos;re getting ...
In that house without being seen .
I know .
Well , if the card &apos;s in there , how we gon@@ na copy it ?
We &apos;re not .
She &apos;s gon@@ na do it for US .
What &apos;re you reading ?
&quot; There is no fighting her . &quot;
I can never find a good bag .
I &apos;m a teacher , and I have books and gra@@ ding materials and ...
I should probably go ahead and just invest ..
In a wag@@ on one of these days .
Ye@@ ah , that &apos;s why I love this bag .
It has so many po@@ ckets .
Do you mind if I take a look ?
Oh , no .
Thanks .
Ah , thank God , thank God .
You all right , m@@ ister ?
Ye@@ ah , my dam@@ n truck ble@@ w a g@@ ask@@ et a few miles back .
Hello , I &apos;m from the alarm company .
We &apos;ve been receiving some , u@@ h ..
St@@ range signals from your property .
We &apos;d like you to check the windows , please .
Make sure all the contacts are still active .
All the windows ?
Yes , ma &apos;@@ am .
Every room in the house .
Ok@@ ay , hold on .
Does she still have the bag ?
Ye@@ ah .
She &apos;s got it .
Some@@ one posted their ba@@ il .
I need to know who .
I &apos;m showing a Bruce B@@ enn@@ ett .
For@@ mer aid to Governor Frank Tan@@ cre@@ di .
You think it fell out ?
We looked everywhere .
You think we got the thing cop@@ ied ?
Like I said , I can &apos;t read the content ..
Without downlo@@ ading the device , but ..
Then , y@@ e@@ ah , I think we got it .
Do@@ esn &apos;t matter if we got it if we can &apos;t find it .
Where the hell is it ?
It &apos;s still inside the house .
That &apos;s why the ma@@ id went back inside .
She must have found it .
As@@ sum@@ ed it belonged to her b@@ oss .
And then she left it behind .
Well , then gu@@ ess what , f@@ ell@@ as , it &apos;s game over .
You know how many months ...
It took me to make that thing , Michael ?
What , you just think I can w@@ hip up another one in a couple seconds ?
L@@ osing it is not the problem .
If they find it , that &apos;s the problem .
If they find out someone was after that card , we &apos;re done .
What do you mean , done ? What does that mean ?
Does that mean we &apos;re gon@@ na go back to prison ?
Are they gon@@ na kill US ?
Me@@ ans we go in and get it .
If we had a few days , we &apos;ll figure out a way to pull this off .
But I gather we don &apos;t have that kind of time .
Ye@@ ah , you gather right .
Look , if you want US to get that device out of there .
You got@@ ta throw Us a bone .
Give us some extra help .
What you &apos;re asking for requires involving additional people .
Which given the cover@@ t nature of this operation .
I cannot do .
Then you &apos;re asking for the impossible .
No , what I &apos;m asking for is competence , ok@@ ay ?
I &apos;m not the one who put the entire mission ...
In the hands of a dam@@ n ma@@ id .
Look , if the Company finds that copy of S@@ cy@@ lla before we do .
That &apos;s it , Michael , that &apos;s ball game .
They &apos;re gon@@ na find out who was behind it .
What if our father after everything he discovered ..
About the Company , what ..
What if that &apos;s what he finally realized ?
You know , u@@ h , the one thing I remember most ..
About D@@ ad was the back of his head .
Always walking out the front door .
Always running from something .
M@@ om , US , himself .
But the one thing he never ran away from ..
Was his belief that the Company needed to be taken down .
And we got an opportunity to do that .
Then this is our fight , not thei@@ rs .
Man , this ain &apos;t Fox River .
These guys chose to be here .
Remember that .
They got a choice .
Of the U.S. pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary in Liv@@ ing@@ ston , Texas .
Where the brothers were alle@@ ge@@ dly sent .
There are still 105 in@@ mates there .
And no one has been released during that time .
Some@@ one is playing a shell game , Bruce .
I &apos;m just trying to find out who .
I have no criminal jurisdiction over .
I know you b@@ ailed them out .
I know you &apos;ve been in contact with S@@ ara Tan@@ cre@@ di .
W@@ an@@ ted to talk some more about what happened in Panama
How &apos;s that ?
Because you &apos;re a little like me .
Because you &apos;re gon@@ na say you &apos;re fine , that you can handle it .
So , um !
I &apos;ll just leave it at this .
I &apos;m here .
Wh@@ enever you want to talk , I &apos;m here .
But I also knew that if anything happened to me .
You were gon@@ na bl@@ ame yourself .
You would spend the rest of your life pun@@ ishing yourself for it .
And , I can &apos;t bear the thought of that .
So can we make a deal right now that we &apos;re even .
And just wi@@ pe the sl@@ ate clean and no gu@@ ilt and no responsibility ?
If we &apos;re gon@@ na be together .
I don &apos;t want it to be out of a sense of obligation .
Or@@ -@@ or even that we should be .
Because of what we &apos;ve been through .
I just want to start over .
Start over .
Ok@@ ay .
Also , all electronic devices must be turned off at this time .
Our flight time to Atlanta is approximately 52 minutes .
Flight atten@@ d@@ ants , take your seats .
So what did you do last night ?
I cr@@ ashed , went straight to bed .
All right , here we go .
Engine instruments are in the green .
They &apos;re just c@@ ous@@ ins .
We need to get a move on .
The client &apos;s gon@@ na come over to the apartment at 4 : 00 .
I am sw@@ amp@@ ed . I can &apos;t just leave .
Gl@@ oria , we &apos;re here to sell your apartment .
We don &apos;t work at the salon .
Well , I-@@ I tried to talk about it this morning ,
U@@ h-@@ hu@@ h . I &apos;m sorry .
U@@ h-@@ hu@@ h , Jim sorry .
Did you say I act like my job is life and death ?
Well , exc@@ use me , my , my job is just death .
Ye@@ ah , that &apos;s right .
60 hours a week ,
Which remin@@ ds me , I have a customer waiting .
I got@@ ta get back to work .
No , I &apos;ll call you later .
David ? David ?
David , you &apos;re z@@ oning out again .
I &apos;m back , Do@@ c .
So let me get this straight .
You found a John Do@@ e in his 20@@ s on the pav@@ ement near the Strip ,
Swe@@ at on the body bag
Dead men don &apos;t swe@@ at , do they , Doctor ?
About as often as they get up and walk away .
Have a trace of blood , as well .
That &apos;s from the liver stick p@@ unc@@ ture .
What &apos;d you find in his po@@ ckets ?
City bus pass . No particular route .
This old not@@ ebook ,
&quot; St@@ on@@ ew@@ all 1 / 14 , day seven .
Turn around and tell these guys
See how far you get .
Come on .
Maybe you ought to keep that to yourself .
DM@@ V facial recognition ?
Ye@@ ah . Ye@@ ah , it &apos;s worth a shot .
You know , I considered calling the DM@@ V .
Hal@@ f the people that work up there are the walking dead anyway .
Maybe they recognize this guy .
U@@ h , I got the DNA results
N@@ either John Do@@ e was in CO@@ DI@@ S .
Ho@@ dges has a proposal :
Ye@@ ah , &quot; Zom@@ bie DNA Index System . &quot;
He also wants you to know
The pot@@ assi@@ um and glu@@ c@@ ose levels are consistent with the living .
That &apos;s all you have for us ?
Was dism@@ is@@ sed by the scientific community .
but not without one big , fat sc@@ andal .
Rum@@ or has it that Dr. A@@ den
At least until one of his students
He was ban@@ ished by the university ,
So the government didn &apos;t want to step on the to@@ es
All right , so our mor@@ gue z@@ om@@ bie
There &apos;s got to be a connection .
Is A@@ den still around ?
He still receives a government pension check .
And I was able to track down the address
Hello , Doctor .
Casino &apos;s three miles further .
Dr. A@@ den ?
Dr. A@@ den .. U@@ h ... we &apos;d like to speak with you .
You got the wrong guy .
We &apos;re from the crime lab .
We found something of yours .
L@@ ying government b@@ ast@@ ards !
They claimed that all of my papers had been destroyed .
Ban@@ ished me from university property .
It was a good way to cut me out of the green and the glory .
It &apos;s Phil@@ o Far@@ n@@ s@@ worth all over again !
I &apos;m sorry . Where did you find this ?
In the pocket of , u@@ h , this young man .
Do you recognize him ?
U@@ h-@@ u@@ h .. He &apos;s dead ?
He &apos;s obviously on an aut@@ op@@ sy table .
Actually , the young man in question ...
.... arose .
The Laz@@ arus my@@ th made real ?
Re@@ -@@ animation ? This is getting more interesting .
It &apos;s , u@@ h ...
not as easy as you might think , bringing back the dead .
Tre@@ ating the work as their own .
In your , um , re-@@ animation experiments , Doctor ,
I had the I@@ th@@ aca of that most profound mystery within my sights .
C@@ ould almost reach out and touch it .
But I saw the storm clouds gathering .
The ma@@ el@@ strom .
For those not wise enough to pull their s@@ ails in ,
It &apos;s a dead man &apos;s party .
Exc@@ ept the third person looks like a woman .
How could they do this ?
What have they done ?
If they &apos;ve given it to some health club ...
Dr. A@@ den , slow down .
Du@@ de . You going to tell us what we &apos;re taking ?
No need to add bag@@ gage to your trip .
Trust me , Kurt .
It &apos;s going to be an adventure .
It &apos;s time to put your cameras on .
See you on re-@@ entry .
Go@@ d@@ speed , Alice .
Max &apos;s friends Kurt and Alice .
Maybe we can get access to Max &apos;s university email account ;
See who his co-@@ pil@@ ots were .
Ye@@ ah .
Blo@@ cking out all ear@@ thly stim@@ uli .
You know , in the movie Alter@@ ed States ,
To strip the self down
You wouldn &apos;t want to go v@@ ent@@ uring
Maybe the tank wasn &apos;t his idea .
I noticed some f@@ ain@@ t bru@@ ising that started to develop
So , I sn@@ apped some infr@@ ared photos .
Hand marks . He was held down .
That &apos;s one way to dro@@ wn in just ten inches of water .
So dro@@ w@@ ning is CO@@ D ?
Con@@ grat@@ ulations . You &apos;re bat@@ ting . 500 .
Ye@@ ah , great for a h@@ itter , bad for pron@@ ounc@@ ing death .
Let me see your E@@ KG .
What are you looking for , Do@@ c ?
Your z@@ om@@ bie from the strip was under the influence of a par@@ aly@@ tic ,
The way you &apos;ve got it set , it wouldn &apos;t pick up my hear@@ t@@ beat .
I &apos;d be a fl@@ at-@@ liner .
You &apos;re lucky you &apos;re not ben@@ ched .
C@@ ould this cock@@ tail produce , in certain individuals ,
Why do you ask ?
Well , one of our young expl@@ or@@ ers killed the other .
Well , I would have to know more about
There &apos;s no fighting in the war room , Dr. Stran@@ gel@@ ove .
I want you to look at something .
.... beyond our past jour@@ neys of the mind .
Ton@@ ight , we free ourselves from the physical plane .
Alice even plu@@ cked out the black ones .
She &apos;s got some academic hon@@ ors awards
A card from her mo@@ m &apos;s fun@@ eral five months ago .
Do@@ esn &apos;t take a det@@ ective .
M@@ om &apos;s death took a toll .
O@@ oh , another one of Dr. A@@ den &apos;s not@@ ebooks .
Stand back , si@@ r .
Dr. A@@ den said this was going to end b@@ adly .
We have two dead .
L@@ et-@@ s hope there &apos;s still time for Alice .
The not@@ ebook I found in Alice K@@ ats@@ u &apos;s room
It is a dat@@ e-@@ tag match to a formula
which means Dr. A@@ den wrote those notes recently .
Right .
The not@@ ebook was not among his archi@@ ved papers .
So how did Alice get it ?
From the doctor himself .
He and Alice were e-mail bud@@ dies .
She initiated contact five months ago .
When her mother died .
But A@@ den is not exactly advertising on bus ben@@ ches .
Alice saw an an@@ onymous comm@@ enter
She kind of felt like m@@ r . An@@ onymous knew a little bit too much .
So she e-@@ mails ,
I was scanning through Kurt Da@@ w@@ son &apos;s video
So , here . Kurt &apos;s just wander@@ ing campus .
Then this happens .
Some kind of inter@@ ference .
Ye@@ ah , Kurt &apos;s receiver picked up a signal from another camera .
I &apos;m working on isol@@ ating the comp@@ eting image ,
Well , those are women &apos;s shoes .
Are we looking through Alice &apos;s camera ?
She must have been in close proximity to Kurt ,
Where is she , and what &apos;s she doing ?
It &apos;s hard to say . But check this out .
What , a car stopped for her ?
Weather ra@@ dar , off . Land@@ ing gear , down .
Wi@@ pers , off .
Battery power , auto . External power source connected .
AP@@ U Fire Protection Test Button , check .
Flash@@ light , check . Escape rope , check .
Sich@@ uan 86@@ 33 , you are identified .

7@@ W A@@ 81
And that &apos;s when the dream that was Paul Young &apos;s life
Years later ,
This woman had no identification ,
And that is how people learned that Fel@@ ic@@ ia T@@ ill@@ man
I see you got the suit I sent over . You like it ?
I like anything that &apos;s not orange .
Well , get ready to do all sor@@ ts of shopping .
Your settlement check came in .
So where you going first ?
After all these years in prison ,
All I want is to go home .
What ? To your old neighborhood ?
You sound surprised .
N@@ one of your neighb@@ ors supported you during the trial .
No one would bl@@ ame you if you h@@ ated them a little .
Oh , I don &apos;t hate them ...
A little .
And so my husband returned to W@@ ist@@ eria Lan@@ e .
The neighb@@ ors were surprised to see him .
They h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t thought about Paul Young in years .
But he had thought about them .
And he was going to make sure
The phone call that comes in the middle of the night ..
The letter that arri@@ ves by special cour@@ ier ..
The e-mail marked &quot; Ur@@ gent ! .. &quot;
Yes , there are all sor@@ ts of ways
It must be delivered in person .
Why do I have to tell them ?
You said this couple lives in your neighborhood .
Tru@@ ste@@ es of the hospital feel
And just what am I supposed to say ?
&quot; Great block party .
&quot; by the wa@@ y. one of our nur@@ ses
Norm@@ ally , I &apos;d give you a hu@@ g ,
Again , very sorry .
God ! How am I gon@@ na tell Carlos ?
He is gon@@ na be so angry !
And he &apos;ll probably find a way to bl@@ ame me !
You &apos;ll never gu@@ ess who &apos;s back !
M@@ om , we don &apos;t have any clean plates .
He paid in advance , and he didn &apos;t have pets . I didn &apos;t care .
How is Paul even out of j@@ ail ?
That mani@@ ac was serving a life sentence .
Hello , ladies .
If you &apos;d like to come in for a while .
I &apos;ll tell you the story .
Come on now .
It &apos;s a good one .
Fel@@ ic@@ ia T@@ ill@@ man &apos;s alive ?
Why are you so surprised ?
I said that over and over again in my trial .
Oh , wait . That &apos;s right .
N@@ one of you could make it to the cour@@ thous@@ es
I told myself I &apos;d explain how I was framed
In our defense , we thought you were a col@@ d-@@ bloo@@ ded k@@ iller .
I missed my friends .
In@@ no@@ cent or not , that guy still gives me the cre@@ eps .
I can &apos;t believe p@@ au@@ l young is back on W@@ ist@@ eria Lan@@ e .
And he &apos;s using my shower .
Jack !
You here for your 9 iron ? Dam@@ n , I thought if I sha@@ ved ,
Actually , I need to talk to you and your wife .
You look a little pa , bud@@ dy . Some@@ thing wrong ?
I think we should wait for gab@@ y .
Jack , what &apos;s going on here , man ?
You &apos;re making me nervous .
Let &apos;s just go inside , h@@ mm ?
No ! This is impossible .
We haven &apos;t been able to track the family down yet .
Then we &apos;re not telling gab@@ y ,
Carlos , I have a legal responsibility here .
She has to be told .
Fine ! I &apos;ll do it .
but I don &apos;t know how .
This is going to destroy her .
N@@ ope . I was wrong . P@@ rest@@ on ,
Why are we doing this ?
When ren@@ ee pul@@ ls up to this house .
It &apos;s so ... CO@@ zy and intimate and ...
It &apos;s So ... CO@@ zy and intimate and ...
Pay attention , kids .
You &apos;re learning a lot of new words for &quot; small . &quot;
I hate b@@ ang@@ ing around my lon@@ ely old bar@@ n of a house .
Sometimes weeks go by without me
I &apos;m sure you see them on whi@@ pping day .
Lyn@@ ette , why so mean ?
I worked on these compli@@ ments all the way from the airport .
Drive s@@ lower next time .
M@@ om .
It &apos;s all right . We &apos;re just old friends re@@ connecting .
You know , they set their own hours .
They work from their own homes .
And oh , yo@@ y , yo@@ y , the money .
That sounds like a dream job .
I &apos;ll bet you &apos;d be real good at it .
Come on .
You said you had money problems .
Here &apos;s what Mar@@ tha makes in a week .
Un@@ to Mar@@ tha for selling her dignity
I promise , you won &apos;t do anything
Look for yourself ! She &apos;s on camera three !
What are you looking at ?
Just some family photos .
Nice of your physical therap@@ ist to help with the move .
So are you gon@@ na be ok@@ ay ?
Let &apos;s see . U@@ h , I &apos;m getting a divor@@ ce .
I lost my business , and I &apos;m sitting here
I &apos;ve had better mon@@ days .
I &apos;m sorry .
Don &apos;t be .
It &apos;s for the best .
We haven &apos;t been happy for a long time .
I think I need to sit qui@@ et@@ ly
Well , whatever you do ..
I know it &apos;ll be spectacular .
Goo@@ d-@@ b@@ ye , B@@ ree .
Hi , b@@ ree .
I &apos;ve been thinking about our conversation last night .
I just wanted to see how you were doing .
I &apos;m fine .
In fact , I took your advice .
I found myself a project .
I &apos;m surprised you agreed to see me .
I wanted to sp@@ it in your face .
I didn &apos;t realize there &apos;d be glass .
That &apos;s right . You &apos;re not used to prison .
Give yourself time .
18 months with good behavior .
You &apos;re giving me a lot of reasons
Maybe I can give you a few po@@ inters on prison life .
I &apos;ve become a bit of an expert thanks to you .
H@@ ey , here &apos;s one .
It never hur@@ ts to tip the guard does your cav@@ ity search .
I will see you behind bars again , or dead ...
W@@ hi@@ ch@@ ever is easier .
Here &apos;s another poin@@ ter .
They always record the convers@@ ations ,
You mur@@ dered my sister .
That &apos;s a crazy , ground@@ less acc@@ us@@ ation .
I have to go now .
I have things to do like shopping
What was Lyn@@ ette like in college ?
U@@ h , absolutely fear@@ less .
She just kept wearing those par@@ ach@@ ute p@@ ants ,
Yes , Ren@@ ee was always the one with the fashion sense .
Before I met her ,
I &apos;d never even heard of Gu@@ C@@ ci or Pra@@ da .... .
I &apos;d never even heard of G@@ UC@@ ci or Pra@@ da ...
Or Ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia .
Wo@@ w , you guys play rough .
A bl@@ ouse from the &quot; I &apos;ve stopped trying &quot; collection
And .. som@@ ebo@@ dy got h@@ unt .
That &apos;s great@@ . easy shots . You got more money than me .
Oh , it &apos;s not about the money .
The Lyn@@ ette I knew never would have settled for this .
You were adv@@ entu@@ ro@@ us .
You j@@ ump@@ ed on@@ stage at a Spring@@ ste@@ en concert .
It &apos;s just hard for me to re@@ conc@@ ile
who had a thre@@ es@@ ome with two of the guys
Why would she do this ?
Why would she jump in a private jet
Two guys , hu@@ h ?
We &apos;re not talking about that anymore .
I mean , isn &apos;t her life perfect enough ?
Does she really need to score bonus points
So was it one ru@@ g@@ by guy and then the other ,
Oh , drop it , Tom .
You know , I have shi@@ el@@ ded you
When she made that ... &quot; aw@@ W , &quot;
She doesn &apos;t get to be dis@@ appointed in my life .
Well , maybe you should tell her how you feel .
Ye@@ ah . You &apos;re right . You &apos;re right .
In fact , I am going to tell her a lot more than that .
And I won &apos;t let anything change that .
Por@@ k ch@@ ops for dinner .
I know it was a bit of a spl@@ urge ,
Some@@ thing wrong ?
The bank turned down my loan application .
Without that money , I can &apos;t hire any help .
And without help ,
We &apos;ll never get ou@@ tt@@ a here like that .
Or@@ son , don &apos;t we have plans ?
The wine ta@@ sting ?
Why don &apos;t you wait for me in the van ?
As you may have g@@ le@@ an@@ ed ,
Was it evol@@ ving while you and I were still together ?
No , no , of course not .
That would be a hard no .
H@@ old , please .
Two mo@@ thers . Only one gets the k@@ id .
We knew they &apos;d shoot that down .
They are shooting everything down
They have the luxury of being un@@ reasonable right now .
We have less than 12 hours to try to sett@@ le .
Their witness lin@@ eup is better , and they know it .
We have Richard Web@@ ber .
Gam@@ ble .
We &apos;re here .
Or else they both stand their ground .
We &apos;ll see you in court .
And the k@@ id gets tor@@ n apart .
Hi , Sofia !
M@@ er will be down in a second .
I &apos;m so sorry about this .
Please . It &apos;s the best way to spend a day off .
I &apos;m thinking p@@ anc@@ akes for breakfast .
With chocolate chips ?
Dam@@ n it . U@@ ter@@ us is per@@ for@@ ated .
Let me have a look there .
Thank you .
Get@@ ting fluid in her ab@@ dom@@ en .
This pregnancy has just become non-@@ vi@@ able .
This baby &apos;s bar@@ ely vi@@ able outside that wom@@ b .
It &apos;s only 24 weeks .
You can repair it , can &apos;t you ?
I can try .
Th@@ row in a plas@@ ma patch , hope for the best .
&quot; Hope for the best ? &quot;
Then a patch is the way to go .
Five seconds ago , you wanted to deliver .
Now you &apos;re confident in a plas@@ ma patch ?
Dr. K@@ are@@ v , I am the O@@ B on call here .
If I say that a patch is best , a patch is best .
K@@ ep@@ ner ?
If it keeps the baby in ,
Stay in your lane , Dr. K@@ are@@ v .
Pre@@ p alb@@ um@@ in pol@@ ym@@ ers , please .
I &apos;ll update the mo@@ m .
How &apos;d it go ? How &apos;s J@@ enny ?
Well , she &apos;s still in surgery but doing great .
We located the source of the le@@ ak ,
And the baby ?
The baby is healthy and still in uter@@ o ,
It &apos;s too little to be born , right ?
It wouldn &apos;t be ideal .
I-@@ I need you to sign one more form
It seems like I was just here
t for@@ ts and it was really fun .
Morning ! Come on in !
I don &apos;t want to .
I &apos;m sorry . It &apos;s been a really rough morning .
She wo@@ ke up really early
It is a tran@@ script of text messages
C@@ alli@@ e and I swa@@ p all the time .
We have very flexible sched@@ ules .
C@@ ould you please tell the court the t@@ ally at the bottom ?
Dr. Web@@ ber ?
She asked Dr. Tor@@ res to switch with her 34 times .
We know she was out with you at least 25 times .
And that &apos;s in addition to the previously mentioned
Now , let &apos;s just p@@ ause and think about this for a minute .
There are only 180 days in six months &apos; time ,
150 out of 180 .
C@@ alls for spec@@ ulation .
Sustain@@ ed .
Your Hon@@ or , we &apos;d like to request a short rec@@ ess .
So , C@@ alli@@ e &apos;s ok@@ ay sl@@ ut@@ -@@ sh@@ aming me now ?
Don &apos;t let them r@@ attle you .
They &apos;re making it sound like a working mo@@ m is a bad mo@@ m .
I mean , we just lost in there , right ?
H@@ ey !
All you got@@ ta do is come and get it .
It &apos;s mine and I want it .
God dam@@ n it , be careful with that !
Come on , let &apos;s go . Take me out of here .
That cost a lot of money ,
Os@@ good ?
No one &apos;s got a fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; name like Os@@ good .
God dam@@ n it !
I try to be@@ have like a gent@@ lem@@ an , Dor@@ is .
I really do , you know , but there &apos;s an animal side to everybody .
You think less of me , don &apos;t you ? For walking out
I was the one who dra@@ gged you out of there .
I say that &apos; cause I think it &apos;s the truth .
I &apos;m a licensed pilot , took kar@@ ate in Tokyo .
I lec@@ tured on economics at Y@@ ale .
I can mem@@ ori@@ ze the front pages
I was the National Golden Glo@@ ves champion three years in a row .
I &apos;m flu@@ ent in four languages
Jesus !
Don &apos;t interrup@@ t me . There &apos;s more .
Ye@@ ah .
I lie al@@ ot .
I &apos;m staying at Caes@@ ars , Mr. Wild .
Sh@@ all we say 7 : 00 ?
7 : 00 . , Mr. K@@ inn@@ ick
It fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; worked ! It really worked .
How could you be such a b@@ ast@@ ard O@@ s , hu@@ h ?
You said I was a cow@@ ard and my breath was bad .
That &apos;s not an ins@@ ult , that &apos;s a fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; ins@@ ult
And you didn &apos;t tell me you were gon@@ na take my fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; hair .
What was that , man ?
She likes you better without it .
He@@ h , women , they like hon@@ est@@ y .
Who knew ? Word to the wise .
All right , fresh from the bank ..
I stay with her on account of our four kids and I can survive ,
What &apos;d I miss ? The special spec@@ im@@ en .
Fu@@ ck ! Sh@@ h , he &apos;s about to ask for a memory .
Ok@@ ay , she &apos;s dead , but she won &apos;t lie down .
Oh , she &apos;ll lie down . She just doesn &apos;t realize
I could get a key to a $ 1,000 suite .
So please , Marie , leave me with the memory .
Give me something I can cher@@ ish to remember .
Ok@@ ay .
Ok@@ ay . Thank you . Come on .
Son of a b@@ itch ! How does he get fu@@ cked every time ?
I use disc@@ s , actually .
Dis@@ cs , tap@@ es .
You &apos;ve got to con@@ front him with this . Record his reaction .
Even if he den@@ ies it , it &apos;s something .
I &apos;m in a tri@@ cky position here . I signed a confidenti@@ ality agreement .
It &apos;s a bit late for that .
And what if I don &apos;t record any disc@@ s ?
Then you &apos;ll be sub@@ po@@ en@@ a@@ ed and forced to repeat this whole story .
Then I &apos;ll deny it .
Then I &apos;ll give them this .
Frank is recording every word .
Ar@@ en &apos;t you , Frank ?
Oh ! Come on !
Don &apos;t look so sho@@ cked . What did you expect ?
That I &apos;d come into a meeting with a man working for Lang
Exc@@ ept you &apos;re not working for Lang anymore .
You &apos;re working for the good guys .
You know all this is point@@ less , don &apos;t you ?
In the end , he &apos;ll just reti@@ re over here with his CIA pension ,
Good evening , si@@ r . Ha@@ ther@@ ton welcomes you abo@@ ard .
Thank you .
It &apos;s my first time in a private jet .
Well , let &apos;s hope it &apos;s not your last .
Hi , man .
H@@ ey , bring my gh@@ ost a Cal@@ v@@ ados .
Yes , si@@ r .
Do you mind ?
Leave it off for now .
R@@ uth said you were in New York to see Mad@@ do@@ x .
I &apos;ve never heard such utter balls in my entire life .
Mike would never have believed such cra@@ p . He was too cle@@ ver . To@@ o loy@@ al .
Mike betra@@ yed you to Ry@@ cart .
How do you know that ?
He told me .
You think it was just one guy doing all that work ?
Do you mind if I don &apos;t think about that ?
Oh , je@@ al@@ ous ?
I &apos;m not je@@ al@@ ous .
I am .
But at least I know she &apos;ll be having a long day at work .
Well , at least we know brain surgery
You got to be more than 180 now .
I &apos;d like to see you get back under 145 .
Exc@@ use me , but thinking of you men in ti@@ ghts makes me want to ...
pu@@ ke .
There &apos;s a fl@@ u going around the hospital .
Some@@ what ir@@ onic .
Don &apos;t push so hard .
Can you lift your shirt ? So I can examine your stomach ?
Cla@@ i@@ re@@ . you &apos;ve had surgery recently .
These sc@@ ars are still pink .
Don &apos;t tell my parents .
You did this in Mexico so your parents wouldn &apos;t know ?
What did you have done ?
And you noticed her foot tw@@ it@@ ching ?
Come on , Jam@@ ie .
My foot .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah .
About three months ago ?
Just a little .
We took her to county hospital , and she got the C.@@ T. scan ,
And the tw@@ it@@ ching has gotten worse ?
A lot worse . They don &apos;t have the proper equipment back home
H@@ unt them down if you can &apos;t find them .
Right away .
G@@ ot the fl@@ u ?
Ye@@ ah , and thanks for it .
It &apos;s making my life so much easier .
I didn &apos;t give it to you . It &apos;s all over the hospital .
You should be in bed .
Dis@@ ease , diagnosis , and pres@@ cription from one man .
Seri@@ ously . I &apos;ll give you a ride home .
This is not gon@@ na make me go home .
You go home .
But I feel fine .
Not as up close as Mer@@ edi@@ th has .
What ? Are you trying to get her in trouble ?
She &apos;s our friend .
George , this program will make or break our care@@ ers , ok@@ ay ?
Some of us will make it through , and some of us won &apos;t .
And that decision depends entirely
It &apos;s not her fault , it &apos;s Sh@@ ep@@ herd &apos;s .
He &apos;s the atten@@ ding . He should know better .
He &apos;s taking advantage of her .
It didn &apos;t exactly sound like
Ok@@ ay , we &apos;re in good shape here .
I think so , Dr. Sh@@ ep@@ herd .
L@@ ooks good .
Here you go , do@@ c .
H@@ ey , Jam@@ ie , here &apos;s what we &apos;re gon@@ na do .
We &apos;re gon@@ na put this on your arm , ok@@ ay ?
Is@@ n &apos;t that fun ?
Here , we &apos;re gon@@ na put that onto you , like that .
And this is gon@@ na feel cold .
This is a butter@@ fly .
Butter@@ fly lands right there .
M@@ mm , there we go . Blan@@ k@@ et for the butter@@ fly . Good . Nic@@ ely done .
It &apos;s amazing stuff , isn &apos;t it ?
H@@ ey , you like spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps ?
Ye@@ ah .
You do ? Ok@@ ay , should we take Captain O &apos;@@ mal@@ ley ,
Let &apos;s go .
It &apos;ll be saf@@ er to wait until your lunch di@@ gests
I &apos;m just concerned .
Where did you get the idea to do this ?
The Internet .
Hon@@ ey , there is a healthy way to lose weight .
Ye@@ ah , I tried that , but
What are you eating ?
And how much have you been working out ?
Most of the time , when people hit their target weight ,
Everyone gains weight in college , M@@ om .
It &apos;s ... stres@@ s@@ ful .
l just thought if I wasn &apos;t wor@@ ried about my diet , then ...
I could focus more on my studies .
So you took yet another short@@ cut ?
Life doesn &apos;t work that way , Cla@@ ire .
T@@ ina !
What ? You want to argue this ?
She has so much potential . If she would just apply herself
The condition has gotten radic@@ ally worse
Left un@@ treated , the disease is gon@@ na kill her .
How soon ?
To@@ o soon .
So , is there a cure ?
The treatment requires the dise@@ ased portion
See , eventually , the sp@@ inal fluid will fill the cav@@ ity .
Her age makes it possible .
Her brain &apos;s not fully developed ,
But will she be normal ?
There are risks to any surgery ,
But if , you know , we &apos;re successful ,
Look , I know this is a lot to di@@ gest .
The important thing to remember is that we can save her life .
Thank you .
Dr. O &apos;@@ mal@@ ley ?
Yes ? What
But if the parents consent ,
Are you in , or not ?
U@@ h , in .
Good .
Yang .
Get out ! I would kill for that .
We &apos;re gon@@ na cut out half a girl &apos;s brain
It &apos;s ou@@ tra@@ geous .
Almost makes it hard to hate him .
Why do you hate him ?
Oh , no reason .
You know about him and Mer@@ edi@@ th ?
You know ?
When are you gon@@ na figure out that I know everything ?
She knows .
I know .
We need to free the bow@@ el from the ad@@ hes@@ ions caused from the ab@@ sc@@ ess .
This poor girl ...
What was she thinking ?
She wants her mother &apos;s approval .
She wanted to please her .
And this damage is the result ?
Well , getting proper nutrition will be a li@@ fel@@ ong problem for Cla@@ ire .
Great .
As if we already don &apos;t have our hands full with her .
She gets good grades .
She stays out of trouble .
She &apos;s smart .
I just think she feels like
You know , Taylor , her an@@ es@@ thes@@ ia &apos;s aw@@ ful light .
Come on , Taylor , she &apos;s w@@ aking up .
Dr. Taylor ?
U@@ h , he &apos;s as@@ le@@ ep !
Taylor !
Dr. Taylor !
Oh , God , sorry . Sorry , I &apos;m on it .
My bad , She@@ p .
He was right , wasn &apos;t he ?
A@@ w , I no@@ d@@ ded off . Come on .
Wh@@ atever you got to do to get through the day , right ?
St@@ eph , get me some coffee .
Yes , doctor .
I &apos;ll be fine . It won &apos;t happen again .
Ye@@ ah , not in here , it won &apos;t .
U@@ h , St@@ eph , call Dr. Penn@@ ington .
Hop@@ kins , take over until she gets here .
Get out of here and get it together .
What happened ?
I wish them the best of luck .
Does that mean you believe he &apos;s innocent ?
It means I believe in the process
Whether it &apos;s just or not
Ok@@ ay thank you very much War@@ den .
And we will be here with you throughout the night .
Thank you .
How long until ..
16 hours .
Are his law@@ yers making any progress ?
Is there still a chance with that ? No .
There &apos;s only one person who can really stop this execution .
I need to see my brother .
Just to tal@@ k.@@ For five minutes .
Ye@@ ah . Ye@@ ah . I &apos;ll try .
OK ..
I &apos;m sorry .
I &apos;m told that you have to wait until final vis@@ itation .
Would you talk to your father for me
Belie@@ ve me my father knows where I stand on the death penalty
S@@ ara .. Dr. Tan@@ cre@@ di I &apos;m sorry .
This isn &apos;t about the mor@@ ality of the death penalty .
This is ..
This is about killing an innocent man
Just talk to Lincoln &apos;s att@@ or@@ neys
Michael
And if I &apos;m the one asking for cl@@ em@@ ency for your brother
I &apos;m sorry
Ye@@ ah but a secret inform@@ ant claims that Ste@@ ad@@ man is still alive ?
I don &apos;t know Nick It all sounds pretty far@@ -@@ f@@ et@@ ched .
You &apos;re his cl@@ er@@ k just get US on the do@@ cket .
Nick you &apos;re asking him to commit political suicide
If he grants it he can order a stay until the tests come in .
Oh well that &apos;s better . Dig@@ ging up the Vice President &apos;s brother .
No way .
L@@ yle L@@ yle look we took In@@ tro to Ci@@ v Pro together remember ?
We studied for the Bar day and night in that cra@@ pp@@ y little apartment of yours
Nick you filed an 11@@ th-@@ hour motion
Come on L@@ yle everyone knows you run that cour@@ tro@@ om .
You can &apos;t adjust things around a bit ?
The inform@@ ant that was killed yesterday I was there .
I know fir@@ sth@@ and these people will do whatever they can to frame Lincoln for Ste@@ ad@@ man &apos;s murder .
All we &apos;re asking is to be heard .
I &apos;ll give you 15 minutes this afternoon that &apos;s it .
Thank you .
He doesn &apos;t even know what happened .
He knows you tried
He &apos;s your brother . He knows you .
So yes .
I promised I would get him out of here
En@@ ough man all right
You don &apos;t get a man &apos;s hopes up like that and then just ...
Back Up or I &apos;ll beat your sk@@ inny ass into the ground .
And it wouldn &apos;t take much to do it .
All right ladies re@@ c time is over . Back on the block !
You ow@@ e me a ticket out of here pretty .
And I will collect .
I &apos;m really sorry about your brother .
Thanks .
Look I know you were counting on this so ...
Let me worry about my problems .
For what it &apos;s worth over the years
Once about 10 years ago
H@@ ad to wait another three weeks while they reset the whole process .
And it may sound crazy
So take sol@@ ace in the fact that your brother &apos;s wait is over .
So if something happens to the chair
There &apos;s a lot of protocol in killing a man .
A new death warran@@ t another medical cle@@ arance .
A lot can happen in three weeks .
Y@@ o what sc@@ rap@@ es yo ?
Thanks .
But anything or anyone that could verify your story
I know time is of the essence .
I &apos;ll reserve judgment for now . I &apos;ll take your arguments into consideration
These little b@@ ast@@ ards are the bane of my existence I swe@@ ar to God .
You get this a lot ?
Ye@@ ah they &apos;re attracted to the heat when they &apos;re cold
And he shor@@ ted out the wire just by b@@ iting on it ?
Not by che@@ wing on the wire alone but if the tail tou@@ ches metal
I &apos;ll be dam@@ ned .
So can you change the f@@ use ?
Ye@@ ah there &apos;s another one right here in the box .
Can you do it now ?
Right after I noti@@ fy the state and fill out the pap@@ er@@ work .
It &apos;s a di@@ aper ?
Ye@@ ah .
You need to wear it .
Make me .
Good look hu@@ h ? It &apos;s for the electricity .
Hair gets in the way or something .
I did everything l could .
I know you did .
Last time I had my head sha@@ ved
Remember Der@@ ek ?
B@@ et me 40 bu@@ cks I wouldn &apos;t s@@ have it .
I said make it $ 100 .
Have you heard from Ver@@ on@@ ica ?
She &apos;s supposed to be coming .
Is there any news on the appeal ?
This isn &apos;t gon@@ na happen .
I got to get my head straight .
Let &apos;s just share memories swa@@ p stories
I can &apos;t take it anymore .
All right .
I have to see him .
You can &apos;t go to the prison .
You &apos;ll never make it through the gate .
There will be c@@ ops everywhere .
What &apos;s that ?
I had a dream last ni@@ gh@@ t.@@ You and me were working on a house
And in the dream it felt like we were older .
It was so clear . The whole dream .
And when I wo@@ ke I knew that today wasn &apos;t going to be the end
I know it .
I love you D@@ ad .
They say he takes a lot of them to him .
Him him ?
Him him . And today he &apos;s looking in Tar@@ an@@ to .
What the fu@@ ck is he hop@@ ing to find with these los@@ ers ?
What the fu@@ ck are you saying , T@@ ama &apos; ? It &apos;s good fishing out here .
They &apos;re total sl@@ uts here .
They invited me to au@@ dition for Sal@@ a , as well .
We &apos;re here to see Sal@@ a . I &apos;m her manager .
No manager . Just the girl .
All right . I &apos;ll wait out here .
Ye@@ ah , we &apos;re coming , we &apos;re coming . Who &apos;s there ?
Son@@ ia , P@@ at , then ... ? Where are you ?
At the Tim@@ one D &apos;@@ Or@@ o ?
All right , 20 minutes .
Ser@@ gio needs to finish something for work first .
Unfortunately , you &apos;re lacking two things , class and his acquain@@ t@@ ance .
Two details that will soon be resolved , Fabri@@ zio !
You &apos;re thro@@ wing away your savings , Ser@@ gio .
And you &apos;ll go back to Tar@@ an@@ to dirt poor .
Well , in that case , have some , relax .
It &apos;s so ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned ! I haven &apos;t touched co@@ ke for a good ten years .
So don &apos;t get in the way . The girls love this ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned stuff .
No , I understand .
What did you hear ?
Nothing . You weren &apos;t talking .
Bra@@ vo ...
... Ser@@ gio Mor@@ ra .
You know me ?
You do everything you can to get yourself noticed .
So I &apos;ve studied you a bit , from a distance .
Well , I like to keep busy .
In all these years , he has given us two things
But they &apos;re not enough anymore .
What are you saying , Sant@@ ino ?
Dar@@ ling , could you look after the boy a moment ?
We &apos;re talking seriously here .
Lu@@ ig@@ ino , why don &apos;t you drive around over there ?
And why don &apos;t you fu@@ ck off ?
I &apos;m saying that we lost
Ex@@ plain this a bit more .
You may control six national TV networks ,
All those broken promises ..
People notice .
His collabor@@ ator sentenced to nine years for ties to the M@@ af@@ ia .
People get p@@ is@@ sed off .
He goes abroad and says ,
Does it seems smart to you to go on TV and say ,
Is@@ n &apos;t that true ?
Of course it &apos;s true . You can think it , but you don &apos;t say it .
He &apos;s 70 years old , C@@ up@@ a .
His heart and pro@@ state are w@@ re@@ cked , though he keeps using them ,
I know where you &apos;re headed ,
I &apos;m not going to p@@ iss on my career by promoting an ar@@ ro@@ gan@@ t co@@ ca@@ ine ad@@ dict .
Fu@@ ck you , Sant@@ ino .
Get the fu@@ ck off me , now . I will not che@@ at on my man .
What the fu@@ ck ?
What are you , 13 ?
I &apos;ve never che@@ ated on Ser@@ gio .
You just have , dear !
You &apos;re a piece of sh@@ it !
And now people are going to p@@ iss on you .
Because I &apos;ll tell them everything , Sant@@ ino ,
Where are you going ... . ?
Do you have any wishes , Ser@@ gio ?
Some of my wishes have already come true .
Yes ...
Yes , I know , I know .
I mean , they &apos;re totally in@@ competent !
Where the hell are they going to go with that pa@@ thetic majority ?
I think you just need to be patient , you &apos;ll be back in power soon .
Are you bor@@ ed , love ?
Just because your arm is hur@@ ting , you think it &apos;s going to fall off !
Sh@@ all we do something after the Bag@@ ag@@ lin@@ o Show , dar@@ ling ?
Oh , that &apos;s a sh@@ ame , you have to go back .
Ye@@ ah , Ger@@ i was delighted .
Don &apos;t speak about him like that , love .
This cost me 300 euros and it looks like sh@@ it .
Most powerful man in Italy , time is money .
If only all you needed was a top to make the difference , love !
Did you check me out properly , love ?
Let &apos;s hope this sh@@ it doesn &apos;t go on too long . Oh , God , here we go !
This isn &apos;t politics , this is p@@ ussy .
How did you know , Sil@@ vi@@ o ?
I don &apos;t know anything , I understand .
An in@@ def@@ ati@@ g@@ able lover of my cali@@ bre
Well , that &apos;s precisely what I want to talk to you about .
On one condition .. that you don &apos;t om@@ it her name .
Otherwise I &apos;ll spend all my time trying to figure out who she is ,
Tam@@ ara Mor@@ ra . Do you know her ?
By sight .
A goo@@ d-@@ looking woman .
She &apos;s two-@@ faced , Sil@@ vi@@ o .
She ur@@ ged me to stand as your successor
Listen carefully , Sant@@ ino .
Who@@ ever is not with me is against me .
They &apos;ll be k@@ ick@@ ed out the party and be@@ headed politically .
What is a sal@@ es@@ man , Sil@@ vi@@ o ?
Two things . The sal@@ es@@ man is a lon@@ ely man .
But we &apos;re not interested in that because it would only de@@ press us .
So put that aside , but don &apos;t forget it ,
We &apos;re interested in the other thing .
Who is this ?
August@@ o P@@ all@@ ot@@ ta , head of sales at P@@ all@@ ot@@ ta Real Estate Ltd .
And does this seem to you the time to call people to sell an apartment ?
Yes , ma &apos;@@ am ,
Listen , I don &apos;t have time to waste .
N@@ either do I , ma &apos;@@ am . If I &apos;m calling you now ,
I don &apos;t need an apartment .
Yes , ma &apos;@@ am , everyone dreams of own@@ ing a home .
The self-@@ serving laws you had passed to further your economic interests
Not because the weal@@ thi@@ est man in Italy ,
And not because your politics are nothing more than pop@@ u@@ list propaganda
So if all these in@@ ferences of yours are not the reason ,
Because I wanted to switch sides . That &apos;s exactly the point !
The problem is that , while I wa@@ ited for you , I remembered something .
What ?
What the writer Javier Mari@@ as said about you .
Oh , God , another one ! What did this one have to say ?
He said that when you attend international sum@@ mits ,
This is the reason I cannot side with you .
Sil@@ vi@@ o , you hear how good she is ?
I studied whi@@ st@@ ling technique in Dubai .
And she &apos;s not just good , she &apos;s beautiful .
And I brought her here because she &apos;s dying to meet you .
Bra@@ vo , Fabri@@ zio , but now you can take her back . You go as well , Fabri@@ zio .
Dear Ver@@ on@@ ica ,
Come , dear .
I have a favourite writer as well .
D@@ ino Bu@@ zz@@ ati .
They &apos;re all on holiday , who knows where ?
I don &apos;t give a sh@@ it . Round them up . You &apos;re dro@@ w@@ ning in debt , Fabri@@ zio .
Br@@ ing him the girls and I &apos;ll convince him to help you .
You &apos;ll help me ?
You &apos;ll end up being treated like sh@@ it .
They want you , not him .
I can understand that .
There &apos;s another thing , delicate and anno@@ ying .
It seems that a sort of hand@@ book has been drawn up ,
No k@@ is@@ ses , no hu@@ gs , no p@@ ats on the back ,
I do as I please .
My elec@@ tors like the way I be@@ have with other heads of state .
At least your j@@ ok@@ es , Sil@@ vi@@ o . C@@ ould you at least avoid telling j@@ ok@@ es ?
What do they have against j@@ ok@@ es ?
What about Ch@@ urch@@ ill , then ?
He was famous for his j@@ ok@@ es .
He &apos;s a crazy , sick man . That &apos;s what he is .
Was that less mel@@ o@@ dramatic ?
Remember what Bor@@ bon@@ i said when she saw you in the theatre ?
&quot; You were good , dear , just a sh@@ ame I couldn &apos;t hear anything ! &quot;
Not only were you no actress , but you were a b@@ im@@ bo , too ,
Fine , but remember that this b@@ im@@ bo
Look what you became !
Maybe that &apos;s why I felt the need for compan@@ ion@@ ship .
I built a financial and political empire .
Fine , Sil@@ vi@@ o , fine .
You &apos;ve spent a lifetime telling us and yourself how brilliant you are !
We &apos;ve had enough of it . And you want to know something else ?
It &apos;s not true .
It &apos;s not true you &apos;re as sk@@ il@@ ful as you say you are .
Your skill as a business@@ man consists in having che@@ ated your whole life .
You are so n@@ ai@@ ve !
What do you think every other business@@ man ,
Do you think they &apos;re all blessed with righteousness except for me ?
Let me tell you a truth
They &apos;re all like me .
They &apos;re all prepared either to go around obstacles or kno@@ ck them down .
But I did it better than the rest of them , because I am the best .
You &apos;re just a child who &apos;s afraid of dying .
But I have a duty to be completely honest with you .
You &apos;re not good .
Come back soon .
If I come back later , it &apos;s because I won .
Then you &apos;ll be back soon .
Why won &apos;t they let me gover@@ n ?
Why won &apos;t they let me run this country the way I did my companies ?
Instead the le@@ f@@ ti@@ st judges tor@@ ment me with trials ,
I don &apos;t understand it .
What did you expect ?
That you could be the rich@@ est man in the country ,
Yes , that &apos;s exactly what I expected .
Well , you never got off that cruise ship where we played as kids .
Or maybe I never got on it .
You know something ?
A few days ago , in some magazine ,
And I noticed ...
they all look like Ver@@ on@@ ica .
Why don &apos;t you try again , Sil@@ vi@@ o ?
One day there was a girl here .
St@@ ella she was called .
I appro@@ ached her and she said to me ..
Just be yourself . No , I &apos;m going to be exactly what they want me to be .
&quot; An@@ ch@@ or . &quot;
A reliable or principal support ,
I believe I can do that for your vie@@ wers
Tell us more about yourself
I studied journ@@ alism at the University of Texas .
Of course .

Mad@@ eline .

Is she done , or ... . ?
Hello !

You really sh@@ ouldn &apos;t use hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er like that . It dri@@ es out your skin .
Oh , what swe@@ ater should I wear ?

Some toilet paper so we can stop using our bath m@@ at .
Carol@@ ine , you hold on to this
Why are you giving it to her ?
I mean , you really think she can keep a secret
Well , you don &apos;t want me to have it .
If I know , I &apos;ll sp@@ oil it .

N@@ either did my mo@@ m , which is how I became
Carol@@ ine , I &apos;m warning you .
Don &apos;t let it sli@@ p .
Even if I be@@ g you , don &apos;t tell me .
Ok@@ ay .
That &apos;s why I didn &apos;t want to give it to her .
Your dad wrote and directed this thing too ?
D@@ ang , he &apos;s like the Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck of j@@ ail .

Listen , honey .
You only have to work on Wall Street , ok@@ ay ?

D@@ ad@@ dy , did you and Max talk about this ?
K@@ itten , I know you better than any@@ body ,
You could still be friends with Max .

It must be difficult for you .
My husband being mur@@ dered ?
Yes , quite difficult .

Even the teacher started doing it .
Ye@@ ah , Mam@@ ai he does that
Well , my friend , I know an Indian
It must be fate that the two of you should meet . &quot;
So what has Mam@@ aj@@ i already told you ?
He said you had a story that would make me believe in God .
He would say that about a nice meal .
As for God , I can only tell you my story .
You &apos;ll decide for yourself what you believe .
Fair enough .
Let &apos;s see then . Where to begin ?
Pon@@ di@@ cher@@ ry
Sp@@ ect@@ acle .
Don &apos;t let the stories and pretty lies f@@ ool you , boys .
Religion is darkness .
My dear Ap@@ a believed himself part of the new India .
As a chil@@ ds he &apos;d had poli@@ o .
He used to lie in bed wra@@ cked with pain ,
In the end , God didn &apos;t save him .

Why would a God do that ?
Why would he send his own son
D e@@ al@@ ul@@ S@@ e e O es S
But we can understand God &apos;s son ,
If God is so perfect , and we are not
I came to faith through Hin@@ du@@ ism ,
But God wasn &apos;t finished with me yet .
God works in mysterious ways .
And so it was he introduced him to me again ,
My Arabic was never very good .
But the sound and feel of the words brought me closer to God .
In performing &quot; Sal@@ ah , &quot; the ground I touched became hol@@ ly ground ,
Are you out of your mind ?
Who gave you the permission to come back here ?
You just ign@@ ored everything I &apos;ve ever taught you ?
I-@@ I just wanted to say Hello to him .
You think that tiger is your friend .
He &apos;s an animal , not a pla@@ ym@@ ate !
That tiger ... is not your friend .
When you look into his eyes ,
Nothing else .
You st@@ up@@ id . S@@ ay &quot; I &apos;m sorry . &quot;
You know what your father said about coming back here ?
I am sorry .
I was
This is between a father and his sons .
He said he &apos;s sorry . You &apos;ll just sc@@ are them for life .
Sc@@ are them ? That boy almost lost his arm .
But he &apos;s just a boy .
He will be a man so@@ oner than you think .
And this is a lesson I do not want them ever to forget !
We are doing this for you and Rav@@ i .
Come inside and have some din@@ er .
Veget@@ arian , please .
Oh , my sons and I are veget@@ arians .
Do you have anything ... No no no no no !
Not for grav@@ y .
You don &apos;t want grav@@ y ?
Hello .
I am happy Bud@@ di@@ st .
So I eat rice next to grav@@ y .
I &apos;m sure , grav@@ y is not meat .
It &apos;s taste . You try ?
Don &apos;t worry .
We will have plenty of fresh supplies after we stop in Man@@ ila .
Why give Orange Ju@@ ice tranqu@@ ili@@ z@@ ers ?
He &apos;s not gon@@ na cause any trouble .
The stress of traveling is not good for the animals ,
We don &apos;t want to be cleaning up ,
DO we
H@@ ey . Get rid of me !
It &apos;s my bed .
It was a human to@@ oth .
Don &apos;t you see the island was car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous ?
Car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous ? Like a Venus E@@ ly tra@@ p ?
Yes . The whole island .
The plants , the water and those pools , the very ground itself
But at night , some chemical process
I filled my stores with fresh water ,
I couldn &apos; leave without him , of course
And so I wa@@ ited for his return .
I knew he wouldn &apos;t be ate
No one has seen that floating island since .
And you won &apos;t read about those trees in any nature book .
And yet , if I h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t found those shor@@ es , I would have died .
And if I h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t discovered that to@@ oth ,
Even when God seemed to have abandoned me , he was watching .
Even when he seemed in@@ different to my suffering , he was watching .
And when I was beyond all hope of saving ,
And gave me a sign to continue my journey .
By the time we reached the Mexican shore ,
My strength was gone , I was so weak .
I was afraid that in two feet of water
I strugg@@ led to shore , and fe@@ I upon the sand .
It was warm and so@@ it ,
And somewhere , two eyes were sm@@ iling , that having me there .
II was so spent , I could hardly move .
The cook thre@@ w me a life bu@@ o@@ y and pull me abo@@ ard ,
The cook ... was a dis@@ gu@@ sting man .
E@@ e ate a rat !
We had food enough for weeks ,
Just a bru@@ te bad man .
But he was res@@ our@@ ce@@ ful
It was a week later that he
&quot; N@@ ip@@ ola ! &quot;
here wasn &apos;t anything I could do .
Cou@@ ldn &apos;t look away ...
Cou@@ ldn &apos;t look away
He thre@@ w her body over@@ board ,
Next day , I killed him .

Jesus , Dave ! your mo@@ m &apos;s making veg@@ an cra@@ p for dinner . I wanted meat !
I &apos;m not making anything else !
The die never lie .
I &apos;d play your Dra@@ g@@ ons or whatever if you asked me to .
That would be hil@@ ari@@ ous .
You &apos;re serious ?
y not ? You make it sound like ..
I don &apos;t know , I &apos;m just saying that I &apos;d play if you asked .
When , exactly ?
Can you hang on a second .
It &apos;s a shower night ton@@ ight , so lights out at 9 : 30 .
it wouldn &apos;t kill you to wash a dish either .
H@@ ey . Nothing really . It &apos;s just the usual .
My brother is a sn@@ ar@@ ling ball of anger and my sister is ..
herself .
Good times .
&quot; Dis@@ h@@ es . &quot;
She just wants to play with you .
Em@@ bar@@ rass@@ ing me in front of my friends ?

the first dark kings of the Earth .
At least that &apos;s what they liked to think .
Gi@@ ants are ver@@ min ,
But huge , of course .
They can hit thirty feet and come in all fla@@ vors .
Gi@@ ants have hair of living ice ,
Sw@@ amp Gi@@ ants will clear out a whole village of people ,
Mountain Gi@@ ants ba@@ the in the blood of children ,
h@@ ese cre@@ eps , they &apos;re Harb@@ ing@@ ers .
They just like to watch . Tot@@ ally sk@@ et@@ chy .
you see a Harb@@ inger , a Gi@@ ant is around .
Even worse , though , Tit@@ ans .
These are the big guys .
Like Greek my@@ th stuff .
H@@ old on . You need to see what we &apos;re dealing with .
Gi@@ ants aren &apos;t real .
Then why are you swe@@ ating ?
There you have it .
Can &apos;t compete with a baby de@@ er .
Once they find food they don &apos;t go for the ba@@ it .
We &apos;re going to have to track it .
I want to see if it took a b@@ ite out of this guy , though .
The Gi@@ ant K@@ iller .
See , you never give up , Barbara .
h I could have seen those games .
But then you &apos;d be old .
anny said I could use the table .
Why weren &apos;t you at school ?
Has something to do with a charter I did in Seattle .
What I do know is their end game
And once that happens ,
But I don &apos;t want to involve you in this m@@ ess .
That &apos;s way too dangerous .
I &apos;m not asking your permission , James .
I can do this on my own ,
I don &apos;t understand everything that &apos;s going on ,
Let &apos;s see what we can discover about them .
Find out what their plan is , see what they &apos;re all about .
They &apos;re trying to get you out , and you don &apos;t trust them ?
I don &apos;t trust any of these guys .
Be wise and take advantage .
Now , can you fix the electricity
It &apos;s not that simple .
The water pipes are inside the prison .
The electrical lines are probably running underground
H@@ ey , Lin@@ c .
Look , br@@ o , um , I &apos;m going to be out of your way real soon .
I saw these fl@@ yers for mig@@ rant workers in Colombia .
It &apos;s coffee bean season ,

When I was 15 , my c@@ ousin told me about a job that only lasts
I &apos;m in Panama , I don &apos;t speak the language
I &apos;m going ake money and send it home .
Under@@ ground or not , I &apos;m going to be a dad , Lin@@ c ,

He confirmed what you told me
You and I , we both have people in there
Please let me help you .
Your Spanish as good as your English ?
Yes , Col@@ onel .
I just have one favor to ask .
It &apos;s just outside of the gate .
You , you can bring your men .
Thank you for arran@@ ging this for US , Col@@ onel .
I &apos;m getting something out of this as well ,
You know you can fix this electric problem ?
I won &apos;t know for sure until we can start dig@@ ging ,
My men will shoot you in I back of the head
And you , pat@@ ron , if anything goes wrong .

You have my word on that .
No wor@@ ries , Col@@ onel .

You know , about how US Americans should stick together .

What is it , a &quot; 66 or a &apos; 67 ?
I &apos;m gave him the sho@@ v@@ els . Get him out .
I gave him sho@@ v@@ els too , and guys to work with , just like you .
I worked in the prison he broke out of .
He said he was doing me a favor
And you know what I got ?
H@@ og@@ -@@ tied and left in a pipe under my own prison .
There &apos;s nothing he can do .
The soldiers are watching him .
That &apos;s what I thought ,
He &apos;s buried something in a junction box out there
Go see for yourself .
Tro@@ ub@@ le keeps finding you here in Son@@ a , doesn &apos;t it ?
Let &apos;s take a walk , eh ?
There are rum@@ ors about that you are trying to tri@@ ck me .

Oh ? Let &apos;s hope for your sake that &apos;s true .
H@@ mm ?
But just@@ make sure .

Ye@@ ah , I know ; that &apos;s the problem .
But you will still just run off and do whatever you want ?
What kind of a man are you that just
L@@ ech@@ ero wants to talk to you .
I was just about to get a little tri@@ m .
You &apos;re a real smart guy .
What the hell are you doing in prison ?

So what &apos;s the next step ?
U@@ h we wait .
And I &apos;ll keep you posted .
You know what you need to do .

Now all we have
Thank you .

I got all the clients , but , you know ,
Some@@ one like you at the table when the deal goes down ,
You seem like a good k@@ id , but you got the wrong idea .
We &apos;re just down for some sun and waves .
You could take care of them girls a lot better
You don &apos;t need 10 grand , man ?
Not where I &apos;m going .
Thanks for the beer .
Who is this ?
You know who this is , you son of a b@@ itch .

I was going to sell that on eBay .
You &apos;re still a bad li@@ ar , Dave . I like that about you . It &apos;s a good sign .
You have the gift .
No , I have a life .
You &apos;re the last person Hor@@ v@@ ath saw with the Gri@@ m@@ hold .
That puts you on his list .
So unless you want him to turn you into a p@@ ig who just loves physics ,
This is crazy . You see how crazy this is , right ?
All right . All right .
You help me get it back , you &apos;re done .
Re@@ ally ?
You can walk away .

Who@@ a . What is that ?
Here we go . All right . Mo@@ ve .
Sorry about that . It &apos;s just nice for them to see a genuine icon like me .
For@@ tun@@ ately , they &apos;ll all be dead soon .
And before that , we need to find the boy .
Well , how do we do that ?
We &apos;ll wait until he &apos;s alone .
Now , focus on control . Set me down slow and ste@@ ady .
Dave ? It &apos;s Beck@@ y .

C@@ ould you please hide ? H@@ ide now . Please .

The truth about who &apos;s inside the dol@@ l ?
Swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ t , you &apos;ve put your faith in the wrong man .
Tell me , have you ever been in love ?
You &apos;re in love right now . I can see it in your eyes .
No , no , no , no . Don &apos;t deny it .
I wonder what would happen
Sh@@ ut up .
You &apos;d be no better than the rest of us .
this poll@@ uted , dirty piece of earth ?
I imagine I want it for the same reason you did .
I &apos;m in the gar@@ ment business , so I take that as a test@@ ament .
But I inher@@ ited this property from my unc@@ le .
S@@ adly , he had no children of his own .
He was the one that let them put these tanks up here .
So , you see , this place .... can do nothing for me .
I offered to le@@ ase this site to you for a very fair price
Why is that ?
I like to own the things I use .
I can see that
You gon@@ na check on the new house ?
Ye@@ ah , I &apos;ll see you back home .
Do you need anything else ?
Ok@@ ay .
I &apos;ll be here to pick you up when you get out .
Thank you .
These men are cow@@ ards .
They &apos;re too weak to make a living or even fight with their own hands .
And too st@@ up@@ id to think of anything else to do .
So , you guys have done what you needed to ?
I &apos;m sorry ?
Well , you just said you &apos;ve done what you needed to do .
So , what is it that you &apos;ve done ?
I &apos;m not exactly sure , you know . I just got here at 4 : 00 .
My shift &apos;s actually up , So ..
Right .
So , you &apos;ve done nothing ?
H@@ ey , why &apos;d they want it ?
They wanted the $ 6@@ ,000 worth of fuel that was in it .
Tru@@ cks 14 through 23 are on the road .
Thir@@ ty to 33 are just about ready to go .
Nick , the g@@ ask@@ et &apos;s good . You should get over there and get going
to try to help our business and the city .
But also know that I have never taken anything from anyone .
So when you say that we &apos;ve ...
We &apos;re on the same side here .
Well , yes and no .
And because of that , I don &apos;t really feel comfortable sitting here ..
pre@@ ten@@ ding like the el@@ eph@@ ant per@@ ched on the corner of my desk isn &apos;t there .
So , you know , I can &apos;t go into speci@@ fies right now ...
but we believe that you and your company have broken the law
So next week we will be bringing a case against you .
It &apos;s a little aw@@ k@@ ward , obviously ...
but , I didn &apos;t want to have this happen next week
You know , out of respect .
You have your job to do .
But know that you &apos;re wrong .
And we will take advantage of every opportunity to prove that .
A@@ bel !
Ex@@ ac@@ tly .
C@@ aus@@ ed by the dri@@ ft of soft si@@ lt from the sides of the

What is that ?
It &apos;s a gun .
It &apos;s a fu@@ cking gun .
Where did you get that ?
Your youn@@ gest daughter found it in the b@@ ushes outside our front door .
She was playing with it .
Look . It &apos;s loaded . With the safety off
It was a fu@@ cking go@@ on with a loaded gun looking in our window .
We &apos;ve just pushed it a little too far , that &apos;s all .
Let &apos;s look at it like a bad@@ ge of honor .
We &apos;re big enough now they even give a sh@@ it about us .
You need to go home right away ...
and start going through our set of books .
How far back are they going
I &apos;ll get into it .
One other thing . The bank .
I need you two to sit down with them . I set up a dinner .
I want you both there . Just be up front . Be honest .
I don &apos;t anticip@@ ate a problem .
God knows they &apos;ve given money to bigger cro@@ o@@ ks than us .
Jesus . All right .
that these are dangerous times and we have to adapt .
It &apos;s not like when we was driving
Not well .
He feels very strongly about it .
T can see that .
I don &apos;t think he fully under@@ stands .
What is there to understand
Well , first of all , it &apos;s illegal .
It &apos;s not illegal if I say it isn &apos;t .
My responsibility is to provide ..
safe and tim@@ ely passage of goods and products
We need to Close this deal .
We cannot stay like this any longer .
We have to close on that property .
We &apos;re so weak right now .
Why do you want this so b@@ adly ?
Because I &apos;ve got my entire savings at risk on this deposit .
No , no , no , no . I don &apos;t mean the deposit .
I mean .. this . Why do you want it ?
Have you ever thought about it ?
Yes , I &apos;ve thought about it . I &apos;ve thought about it every day for the last five years .
That place has just been sitting right across that f@@ ence mo@@ cking me .
I &apos;m not talking about that place .
I-@@ I-@@ I just meant everything
I have no idea what you mean .
What &apos;ll we play ?
Here you go .
As you can see , I &apos;m in the middle of my daughter &apos;s birthday party .
I understand and I ap@@ ologi@@ ze . I do .
But this is a warran@@ t , and we need to gain complete access to the property
Let me check something .
J@@ s he serious ?

Maria . Keep the kids playing
Anna Mor@@ ales .
May I speak with you for a minute ?
I understand you and your men have a job to do here .
but we &apos;re in the middle of a 10-@@ year-old &apos;s birthday party .
This is probably one you &apos;re gon@@ na regre@@ t .
Exc@@ use me ?
My husband &apos;s an hon@@ orable man .
We &apos;re not who you think we are .
I think I know your father .
Good for you .
My husband is not my father .
Not even close .
So if I were you ...
I would start treating us with a little more respect .
or I guarantee ..
he will make it his mission in life to ru@@ in you .
This was very dis@@ resp@@ ect@@ ful .
And you &apos;re not gon@@ na find a fu@@ cking thing .
Tru@@ cks 14 through 23 are on the road
Six , what are you doing back here ?
H@@ ey . How are you ?
Look , there &apos;s a door down here about four more flights .
You come out under the bridge . It &apos;s a park .
Fu@@ ck you !
You &apos;re welcome .
Where &apos;s the truck now ?
It &apos;s still up on the bridge
Kath@@ y , it &apos;s me . What are you talking about ? What shots ?
It &apos;s 16 . Some@@ one shot up his truck on the 59@@ th Street Bridge .
Do you know how long it took me to pay you off ?
Seven months . Six and a half
1 put 40 % down deposit on this property
because you said that you would be there .
You now have three serious separate pending legal cases against you ..
one with 16 counts of mis@@ conduct .
ranging from fraud to tax ev@@ asion .
And then today , in the middle of our meeting
which led to a shoot out on the 59@@ th Street Bridge .
So , I should start by th@@ an@@ king you ...
for your assistance in attemp@@ ting to bring in the driver .
Ye@@ ah , we didn &apos;t expect him to react that way .
Ye@@ ah , well , the officers there didn &apos;t set it up very well on their end either .
I &apos;m sorry .
Miss Lange .
It has been brought to our attention ..
that it might be beneficial on your end
It &apos;s a possibility .
So we have prepared an offer for you to review .
I &apos;ll present it to him .
It &apos;s good , Andrew
need more time .
Of course you do .
I know our agreement doesn &apos;t allow for that .
But I need more time .
and I should say that we feel fairly certain ...
after a very fran@@ k conversation ..
that the guys who are doing this
As you know , there are plenty of other smaller providers in the area ..
that might have something to do with it who are not here ton@@ ight , so .
Peter , thank you .
Thank you . That may be true .
But I don &apos;t think it &apos;s as bad as they &apos;re saying it is .
I gu@@ ess I kind of knew what I was doing
G@@ ot us three more days .
That &apos;s great .
And I got a piece from Saul .
When I was putting them to bed ton@@ ight ..
I told them that their dad was out there
I said that whatever he wanted
and that there was no man
This is all worth it .
Of course .

You &apos;ve grown .
You saw me a month ago .
I know . I know . But you have .

And I like them ,
Hon@@ ey , you can &apos;t make people like each other .

Sorry about the wait .
I just got off the phone with London .
Clos@@ ed a deal worth $ 10 million . Ph@@ yl@@ lis ?
Ok@@ ay , ladies , I have 15 minutes ,
The overall look we &apos;re going for is very warm and inv@@ iting .
We &apos;re thinking soft wood , an over@@ stu@@ ff@@ ed linen sofa .
That sounds great , but I already know what I want .
Ri@@ pped that out of a magazine .
This is Donald Trump &apos;s office .
Is@@ n &apos;t it cool ?
I was missing Bet@@ h so much , and ...
Then I remembered that p@@ ant of her was still alive somewhere .
C@@ ould you spare a few minutes
Sm@@ ells good .
Oh , it &apos;s for Paul . Ch@@ icken pot p@@ ie .
Right . You said you were cooking for him .
That &apos;s so thou@@ ght@@ ful .
Well , just trying to be a good friend .
I hope that we can be friends , too .
You do ?
You and me ? Friends ?
I know what you &apos;re thinking .
What I did to Paul was hor@@ ri@@ ble ,
And now I just want things back to normal .
This sm@@ ells wonderful .
I wouldn &apos;t begin to know how to make a pot p@@ ie .
Well , the cr@@ ust is stor@@ e-@@ bought .
But don &apos;t tell Paul , ok@@ ay ?
Don &apos;t you worry .
I know how to keep a secret .
&quot; With repeated small d@@ oses of the tox@@ in ,
&quot; Initi@@ al symptoms include nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting .
These are followed by metaboli@@ c aci@@ do@@ sis
As if he had one .
&quot; And finally , ac@@ ute ren@@ al failure and ..
death . &quot;
or at least that last little piece of you
It just goes to show ...
You may be gone ...
But we &apos;re still one h@@ eck of a team .
Sus@@ an , how &apos;s he doing ?
I don &apos;t get it . He just keeps getting worse and worse .
I think I &apos;m gon@@ na have to start bringing him breakfast , too .
You &apos;re a good friend .
If you stick to my system ,
H@@ ey , swe@@ e@@ tie .
You can relax . She went up@@ stairs .
No , I have to get this done .
Do you want a c@@ up@@ cake ?
Mrs. Van de k@@ amp says those are for after dinner .
Well , Mrs. Van de k@@ amp isn &apos;t here .
I &apos;m not saying I love this more than you and Cel@@ ia ,
Here . S@@ ne@@ ak this up@@ stairs . E@@ at it later .
No , thanks . I &apos;ll have an apple .
What did she do to you ? ! How did she break you ? !
Ok@@ ay , those go right in front of the desk .
Yes , ma &apos;@@ am .
And watch the .. y@@ e@@ ah . Thank you .
U@@ h , what &apos;s going on ? I told the mo@@ vers to be here at 11 : 00 .
We &apos;re supposed to be a team .
I almost bought you
But you didn &apos;t .
Ye@@ ah , and I felt bad about it ...
till now .
I &apos;ve got two dragon lamps in my car .
what the hell am I supposed to do with those ?
I &apos;m sor@@ ry@@ . but trust me ,
How ? Tom said what he wants .
Tom said what he thinks he wants .
I know what he really wants .
And you have to admit ,
We got a 9-@@ 1-@@ 1 call from 2 girls
What ?
Hello again .
I gu@@ ess you found someone to loan you that gun .
Ok@@ ay .
I spoke with the girls . They &apos;re pretty sure
Well , that &apos;s pre@@ po@@ ster@@ ous .
Why would they say such a thing ?
Well , that &apos;s not all they said .
Gab@@ y ? What &apos;s with the pan@@ ick@@ ed ph@@ o calls ?
It &apos;s nothing .
The girls got all fre@@ aked out and called the police .
Did you tell her that , si@@ r ?
I think I know what this is .
Me and the girls were talking about my mother &apos;s death ,
They must have gotten confused .
Ye@@ ah , well , don &apos;t be mad at them .
It &apos;s hard on kids when their parents are apart .
It &apos;s actually kind of funny if you think about it .
I mean , not &quot; funny &quot; funny , but sad ... funny .
D@@ ad@@ dy !
H@@ ey , girls ...
So sorry to have dra@@ gged you out here in the middle of the night .
Let me walk you to your car .
Let &apos;s go pack your stuff . I &apos;m taking you home .
I &apos;m glad you didn &apos;t kill someone .
I &apos;d have felt pretty d@@ umb
U@@ h , tell me something . When someone calls 9-@@ 1-@@ 1 .
I was at disp@@ atch when the call came through .
When I heard the address , I said , &quot; I &apos;ll take it . &quot;
Re@@ ally :
Your neighb@@ or , Mrs. T@@ ill@@ man . Here &apos;s my card .
If you see anything suspicious , I want you to call me .
Ok@@ ay .
I never have a clu@@ e what you &apos;re thinking .
I &apos;m a det@@ ective . I find clu@@ es . I don &apos;t give them .
Good night , citizen .
Good night , det@@ ective .
They are almost done pac@@ king .
I can &apos;t believe you told them .
Ju@@ an@@ ita wanted to know why we were fighting .
I told her the truth .
Great . So now they think m@@ omm@@ y walked out on d@@ ad@@ dy
I &apos;m sorry . I just keep waiting for this to b@@ low over .
We have to face it , Gab@@ y .
This is never gon@@ na b@@ low over .
So what am I gon@@ na do ?
You &apos;re gon@@ na go home to your husband .
I feel guilty enough about Carlos losing his mother .
I will not be responsible for him losing his wife .
I would really love to observe if that &apos;s cool with you .
No , that &apos;s not cool .
Now if you &apos;ll exc@@ use me ,
If you don &apos;t eat , I can do it today .
Did you hear M@@ er just revolution@@ ized the world of cut@@ lery ?
No , I ... did not .
Working on a liver model .
Are you still going to try to remove all of the tum@@ ors today ?
It just seems like it &apos;s a lot to do all at once .
Will &apos;s cancer is a very aggressive sar@@ com@@ a .
It &apos;s an all-@@ or-@@ nothing approach .
We &apos;ve come up with a plan to remove all of them ,
Some will be a sn@@ ap , but there are a few tri@@ cky ones ,
It &apos;s deep in the liver , but we &apos;ll do our best to get it .
We &apos;ll get it .
We &apos;ll try .
Um , it &apos;s sort of like trying to get past level six .
You know , there are some , u@@ h , figh@@ ters ,
We will eat all those d@@ ots and kill all those gh@@ o@@ sts .
She doesn &apos;t play video games .
What are you doing here ?
Oh , I switched with Kno@@ x .
U@@ h . Ben War@@ ren .
U@@ h , I don &apos;t know if we met before I left .
Oh , oh I was actually at your wedding .
I got you that p@@ izza stone .
We have a p@@ izza stone ?
Ye@@ ah , I got you , a , u@@ h , a circular clay stone
It &apos;s kind of my standard gift .
Oh , well then this will change your life .
The cr@@ ust that always stick to the edges never get burned .
You can really tell the difference ?
You broke sc@@ ru@@ b .
I &apos;m sorry ?
Your left hand dropped below the ster@@ ile field .
Go re-@@ sc@@ ru@@ b .
I didn &apos;t move my hand ...
Yes ...
It did . I saw it .
You want to call me a li@@ ar ,
Mir@@ and@@ a. you need a minute ?
I need a quiet O.@@ R. so we can begin .
10 blade .
Right here .
I have to go away from you now .
Re@@ ady with tum@@ or number one .
Ok@@ ay , you see that ?
Already going great . One down ..
14 to go . I wish we had gotten to him so@@ oner .
He was diagnos@@ ed already stage i@@ v .
Typical teen@@ ager .
He ign@@ ored his symptoms ,
And now he &apos;s got an ab@@ dom@@ en completely covered with tum@@ ors .
Well , you &apos;re right . He is a typical teen@@ ager ,
He &apos;s strong , able to fight . And what &apos;s better ?
What ?
You should print a spo@@ on next .
That way we &apos;ll be able to reach tum@@ or number two .
It is an an@@ atom@@ ically correct liver model with a portal v@@ ein .
It &apos;s a plastic b@@ lob@@ .I &apos;m star@@ ving .
Can they print food or just utensils ?
When will the model be done ?
10 , maybe 12 hours .
That long ?
It &apos;s life-@@ saving technology . Sh@@ ane .
If you want it faster , page god .
It &apos;s a f@@ ake organ . How long for functional items ?
Like an actual v@@ as@@ cular gra@@ ft ?
Like a pre@@ tz@@ el .
Good .
In Japan , they &apos;re 3-@@ D making con@@ du@@ its
U@@ h-@@ hu@@ h . Y@@ ay . Japan .
Why can &apos;t we do that ?
Why can &apos;t we use a 3-@@ D printer to create
He wouldn &apos;t need surgery after surgery
Just concentrate on one thing at a time .
We fix the hole .
Then we move on to the next step .
It &apos;s just a routine complic@@ ation .
That happens .
Everything &apos;s under control . We &apos;re good .
You good , Mir@@ anda ?
Thank you .
Put it to the left , dum@@ bass .
What ?
Are you a half
I said place it to the left , idi@@ ot .
Those are things Mark Slo@@ an used to say
Are we taking a walk down memory lane now ?
You know , I convinced him to start teaching you .
You &apos;re a full-@@ w@@ it . Now you have to start teaching the residents .
Hand them the keys .
All right , I get it . Point made .
I know . It &apos;s just so fun .
There she is . Number eight .
Right sm@@ ack in the middle of the liver .
Let &apos;s ski@@ p it .
Skip it ? Why would we do that ?
We &apos;ll come back to it .
No , we planned this surgery in an order .
We should stick to it .
Alex , if we remove the other ones first ,
Let &apos;s just come back to it .
It &apos;s the hard@@ est one .
If it turns out we can &apos;t remove it ,
Ah , you still have the ring .
But you &apos;re seeing other people , obviously .
Um , y@@ e@@ ah . We are .
I &apos;m so sorry . That was way too personal .
I just out of a job interview
I &apos;m just not used to it .
U@@ h , we don &apos;t do things like this at Seattle Pr@@ es .
Well , then , come work here .
Because we do way too personal on a daily basis .
We &apos;ll isol@@ ate the vessels ,
I can do it .
I don &apos;t know if you can , M@@ er .
It might be better just to close him .
No blue .
Nice work , you guys .
Let &apos;s also get a bub@@ ble test .
Do we need both ?
We need to be absolutely sure that there &apos;s no le@@ ak .
If there &apos;s a break@@ down somewhere in the an@@ ast@@ om@@ osis ,
Is that what you want for the patient , Wilson ?
No , ma &apos;@@ am .
You know , bub@@ ble test only takes a second .
So , u@@ h , Wilson , as I in@@ ject air into the N.@@ G. Tube .
No , no , it &apos;s a .. good exhau@@ sted .
I &apos;ve been stuck in this bed ,
And now I w@@ anna be myself again .
Re@@ ady to get back to my feet and ...
be the doctor I used to be .
I lost myself there for a while . K@@ ep@@ ner .
But now I &apos;m ready to get myself back .
And it will be fine !
There won &apos;t be enough functioning liver to support this k@@ id .
I think it will , and I will stop before I &apos;m too deep .
You print one dam@@ n for@@ k , and now you think
Alex , I am in the middle of divi@@ ding this k@@ id &apos;s liver .
And I need this conversation to be over !
Oh , you gon@@ na pull rank on me again ?
Is that how the decision &apos;s made ?
You could 2
What ?
An alliance between me and the fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; F@@ BI ?
No , no , between you and me .
I can help you , Jim@@ my , and you can help me .
Listen , the whole fu@@ cking game has changed .
And I &apos;m not trying to clean up South@@ ie .
Fu@@ ck that ! I fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; love this place .
H@@ ey , bud@@ dy . G@@ ot a question for you .
What are you gon@@ na do with the rest of that ?
Not drink it .
No , bud@@ dy , you got to drink every drop of that . You know why ?
That is pure vitamin C ,
It &apos;s true . Go on . Put it away .
Good boy .
So ...
Do you feel like , maybe ,
Oh , I remember . Some@@ thing did happen .
Ye@@ ah ? What happened ?
Tim@@ my . He &apos;s the k@@ id who &apos;s always trying to trip me .
And he st@@ ole my coloring pen@@ c@@ ils off my desk when my back was turned .
So I pun@@ ched him in the face .
Good boy .
Jim@@ my .
H@@ ey . Let me ask you a question ..
Is that why you think you got in trouble ?
All right . I need you to listen very carefully to what I &apos;m sa@@ y@@ in@@ &apos;
You got to learn from these things , right ?
Here &apos;s the deal .. you did not .
get in trouble because you pun@@ ched this s@@ ne@@ ak@@ y br@@ at in the face . Not at all .
You got in trouble
Jim@@ my ?
I really don &apos;t think that that &apos;s the right thing to be teaching your k@@ id .
No , that &apos;s absolutely what I should be t@@ ell@@ in &apos; him , babe .
So , the lesson you got to learn is this ..
it &apos;s not what you do , it &apos;s when and where you do it ,
You follow ?
Yes , I follow .
P@@ unch people when no one &apos;s looking .
That &apos;s exactly right .
If nobody sees it ..
it didn &apos;t happen .
Well , look what cra@@ w@@ led out of the g@@ utter .
Good afternoon , Officer Fl@@ yn@@ n .
What happened ? I must &apos;ve been doing 30 in a 25 .
Why don &apos;t you do your fu@@ cking job
Do your fu@@ cking job !
I &apos;m doing my fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; job .
I &apos;m sure the officer didn &apos;t stop us by accident .
You wouldn &apos;t happen to be carrying a message , now , would you ?
In fact , I am .
Ger@@ ry An@@ gi@@ ul@@ o sends his regards .
Sa@@ ys he doesn &apos;t like finding his boys
He also said he &apos;s confident
Listen , mo@@ ther@@ fu@@ cker ,
Fu@@ ck you !
Close the fu@@ cking door .
I got to tell you something , Officer Fl@@ yn@@ n .
It &apos;s a sad day when a native son takes up with his op@@ pres@@ sor .
There &apos;s a word for that back home , you know .
Pen@@ alty &apos;s death .
I never trusted Fl@@ yn@@ n . He &apos;s a fu@@ cking pri@@ ck .
Take it easy , will you ?
Even as kids , he was a fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; pri@@ ck !
A fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; pri@@ ck .
Please , calm down .
Swe@@ ar to God , I &apos;m gon@@ na fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; kill him .
I &apos;ll fu@@ cking kill that Fl@@ yn@@ n .
Take it easy , will you ?
This is business .
I couldn &apos;t have said it any better .
You &apos;re a li@@ a@@ ison . You pretty much do whatever you want .
And no one &apos;s gon@@ na raise an ey@@ eb@@ row
There &apos;s just one restric@@ tion on our side ...
you can &apos;t kill any@@ body , Jim@@ my .
Kevin , did you know that Whit@@ ey was an inform@@ ant ?
No , I didn &apos;t know .
I mean , he h@@ ated rats .
We fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; buried rats , especially our own .
I mean , I knew he had his connections in the F@@ BI .
I knew he had his sources .
But I figured he was playing them like he did everybody else .
But obviously , he had a plan .
Where do you get the energy for that sh@@ it , Jim@@ my ?
H@@ ey , Steve . H@@ ang on a minute .
We &apos;ve known each other a long fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; time .
Can I trust you , St@@ ev@@ ie ?
You know you can trust me .
Good .
The lot@@ tery , Jim@@ my ?
What can I tell you , Bil@@ ly boy ?
I went in on a ticket as a lar@@ k ,
Would you say Winter Hill was thri@@ ving ?
We were making a lot of money .
Which meant we had to pay off a lot of people ,
Local street c@@ ops , fe@@ ds , whatever .
We were thro@@ wing money around like crazy .
And then there was those trips to Miami .
Fu@@ ck me .
Ye@@ ah , &quot; fu@@ ck me &quot; and fu@@ ck you is right .
An hour ago , I got a wet s@@ have in a bar@@ ber@@ shop
Jesus , John .
Do you want to talk about who &apos;s a valuable asset , Charles ?
In five fu@@ cking years of
And giving them 40 bu@@ cks to go around the corner
Fu@@ ck that . This , on the other hand
No one else .
Jim@@ my always had a plan .
Like him giving up An@@ gi@@ ul@@ o &apos;s address at 98 Prince Street .
Now , that was a smart play ...
because it kept Conn@@ ol@@ ly , you know ...
off our backs .
We had stuff going on in Florida .
Situation down there was changing , and not for the better .
Roger ?
Thank you , Alan .
It &apos;s an exciting time for J@@ ai al@@ ai ,
John Cal@@ la@@ han has us po@@ ised for great success .
I can &apos;t believe people pay to watch this sh@@ it .
Well , they fu@@ cking love it , St@@ ev@@ ie .
They fu@@ cking love to bet on it . That &apos;s making us very rich .
But who knows for how much longer with Whe@@ el@@ er moving in ?
Gu@@ y &apos;s a fu@@ cking double-@@ bar@@ rel@@ ed pri@@ ck .
But at least we still got this .
Oh , no , no , no . You give that to Kevin , not me .
All right .
So , what &apos;s the problem with this Whe@@ el@@ er guy ? What &apos;s his deal ?
What sign did I have that you could change , Sto@@ ick ?
That anyone on Ber@@ k could ?
I ple@@ aded so many times
This is why I never married .
This , and one other reason .
Go on ,
You &apos;re as beautiful as the day I lost you .
C@@ ould this day get any worse ?
U@@ h , let me see .
We &apos;re gon@@ na jump into free@@ zing cold water
Please , ladies first .
You are a ste@@ aming he@@ ap of dragon .
Take that !
Ok@@ ay , I love you again .
Oh , pa@@ thetic .
You can still jump .
So , are we going to save your dra@@ g@@ ons
Check every tra@@ p .
They &apos;re here somewhere .
Me@@ at@@ lu@@ g ?
Anyone coming ?
I don &apos;t know , you just keep doing what you &apos;re doing
Thank you for saving my life
M@@ om , you &apos;d never even recognize it .
Where we used to make weapons ,
W@@ e-@@ we even fix dragon teeth .
You@@ -@@ you wouldn &apos;t believe how much everything &apos;s changed .
A@@ ye , your son &apos;s changed Ber@@ k for the better .
I think we did well with this one , Val
I got it .
I &apos;ll swim and sa@@ il on sav@@ age seas
Will stop me on my ... journey
If you will promise me your heart
And love me for etern@@ ity
And I would keep you from all harm
Oh , you know , cat@@ ching up with mo@@ m .
That &apos;s your mother ? !
Well , now you know where I get my dramatic fla@@ ir .
The Alpha !
Now we have a fight !
Show them what you got , bu@@ d .
Att@@ abo@@ y !
I &apos;ve wa@@ ited a long time for this .
You cannot take our dra@@ g@@ ons !
They are controlled by the Alpha !
Then it &apos;s a good thing I brought a chall@@ enger .
Another one ?
That is a class ten ! Class ten !
Ok@@ ay , change of plan .
No dragon can res@@ ist the Alpha &apos;s command
T-@@ t@@ ooth@@ less , you ok@@ ay , bu@@ d ? What &apos;s going on ?
Wit@@ ness true strength .
The strength of will over others .
In the face of it ,
He belongs to the Alpha .
But , please , O great dragon master ,
He will not miss a second time .
It wasn &apos;t your fault , bu@@ d .
They ... made you do it .
U@@ h : y@@ e@@ ah .
Why do you ask ?
You know , we have the extra bedroom ,
Oh , my God , that &apos;s so generous !
It &apos;s the least we can do .
What &apos;s going on ?
Well , our friend Ra@@ i moved into my old room ,
Well , what do you think the loss of your room represents ?
Be@@ ver@@ ly , you know l hold you in high est@@ e@@ em .
Can we ski@@ p the part where you pre@@ tend not to know the answer ,
Very well , but , u@@ h , if you don &apos;t mind ,
Now ...
You &apos;ve recently moved in with Dr. F@@ ow@@ ler , yes ?
I have .
Cle@@ arly , your old room represents an escape hat@@ ch ,
I h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t thought about that .
And don &apos;t start thinking about it now !
Hello , A@@ my .
That &apos;s not true !
She said def@@ en@@ sively .
This isn &apos;t about me and Shel@@ don .
This is about Ra@@ i@@ esh moving in with Leon@@ ard and Penn@@ y .
Inter@@ esting .
They &apos;ve found a need to take yet another ro@@ omm@@ ate .
Se@@ ems they &apos;re avo@@ iding some har@@ sh re@@ alities themselves .
I had no idea
Boy , you &apos;re good .
That is the word on the street , dear .
Maybe moving in was a bad idea .
I haven &apos;t been here one day , I &apos;m already causing problems .
You didn &apos;t do anything . It &apos;s Shel@@ don .
That &apos;d make a nice need@@ le@@ point pil@@ low .
So , relax . We &apos;re happy to have you .
Do you actually pay for that hair@@ cut ?
That &apos;ll do it .
H@@ ey , Ra@@ j , I ow@@ e you an ap@@ ology .
Look , could you please put your dog on a le@@ ash ?
Shel@@ don , she &apos;s fine .
Well , then at least hold her still
Ra@@ i , I let my emotions get the best of me ,
Thank you . I appreciate that .
No , I can &apos;t take all the credit .
Be@@ ver@@ ly pointed out that I &apos;m experiencing in@@ securities
What are you talking about ? We &apos;re fine .
Yes , you &apos;re fine as long as you have a buff@@ er
It used to be me .
Now it &apos;s Ra@@ i and his attack Tri@@ b@@ ble .
Any@@ way , I &apos;m sorry for everything .
Why are you saying we have mar@@ ital problems ?
We don &apos;t have mar@@ ital problems !
I see . You must be y@@ elling at me out of we@@ d@@ ded bli@@ ss .
Look , just because we took our friend in does not mean
Ye@@ ah , this is a special circum@@ stance .
Shel@@ don mentioned you tried to get your brother
Ye@@ ah , well , a circum@@ stance can happen twice
Do you agree with that ?
Well , now that you point it out ..
Are you kid@@ ding me ?
We do seem to keep finding ro@@ omm@@ ates .
Now you &apos;re taking her side ?
Dear , I would never come between you and Leon@@ ard .
That &apos;s for your par@@ ade of ro@@ omm@@ ates to do .
Howard ?
It &apos;s me ! It &apos;s just me !
What are you doing here ? !
Leon@@ ard and Penn@@ y were argu@@ ing ...
Not on my watch !
It &apos;s fine . It &apos;s just Ra@@ i .
You can hit him with the bat , but it &apos;s fine .
And if my heart stops , just let me go .
I &apos;m sorry , guys .
Shel@@ don was up@@ set , Leon@@ ard and Penn@@ y were fighting .
I just wanted to go some@@ place where I wasn &apos;t causing problems .
I &apos;ll say it again .
India .
Can I just stay in the garage ?
Don &apos;t do that . We &apos;ll make up the couch for you
The f@@ ever can last at least five days with it .
It &apos;s not that unusual .
I-@@ I &apos;ve been tracking the sp@@ ik@@ es in his f@@ ever ,

That could be why she was an@@ xi@@ ety .
Oh , cool , is it a ep@@ i@@ dur@@ al hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ?
Sorry . I &apos;m interrup@@ ting .
You guys were having a moment or something .
What do you want , Broo@@ ks ?
Well , chief H@@ unt says I need to learn bra@@ iny things .
So I &apos;m with you guys today .
You &apos;re going to TE@@ D ?
Lu@@ cky . My ro@@ omm@@ ate went last year .
Did te@@ qu@@ ila shots with Bill G@@ ates .
It &apos;s a f@@ ancy people fr@@ at party .
Oh , you &apos;ll be singing a different t@@ une next year
Oh , map my gen@@ om@@ es .
That sounds like fun .
It &apos;s not a spa treatment . It &apos;s science .
Just like building new car@@ ti@@ lage
No , you &apos;re right .
I should keep it fresh for the conference anyway .
Exc@@ use me .
U@@ h , just looking for a status report
The injury extends into the a@@ or@@ tic arch .
So in order to maintain head per@@ fusion ,
I &apos;m just waiting on Russell for a second opinion .
You had to call Russell for this ?
Not really .
But ever since I became his b@@ oss ,
Who@@ a . Who@@ a . Who@@ a . Where you going ?
I want to see my parents .
Sorry . He &apos;s a run@@ ner .
Hon@@ ey , we need to go .
No , I don &apos;t want to .
You need sleep .
No , I &apos;m not going anywhere !
Yes , you are . You &apos;re coming with me . Now come .
No . Look , he &apos;s wor@@ ried about his parents .
How about we set you up in a room ,
That &apos;s not a permanent solution .
Are you getting enough sleep ?
No , of course not . I told you , he &apos;s up all night .
And it &apos;s just you , no husband ,
It &apos;s just me .
Well , that &apos;s a lot of pressure on you .
Are you a psych@@ iat@@ rist ?
Cas@@ ey .
You think I &apos;m crazy .
You think I-@@ I ski@@ p work
My son is sick , ok@@ ay ? He is sick .
He used to wake me up every morning at da@@ wn
Now I can bar@@ ely get him up .
That &apos;s a good thought , Broo@@ ks ,
U@@ h , find an O.@@ R. that &apos;s available . Ok@@ ay ?
Oh , Broo@@ ks .
You never miss , do you ?
Star pup@@ il .
Cir@@ cus act .
His CAT scan is completely normal .
I know this must be so anno@@ ying for you .
I mean , I know I know nothing ,
Please . Um ...
What &apos;s first ?
Ok@@ ay , are you sure that it &apos;s not lu@@ pus ?
He doesn &apos;t fit the criteria ,
What else ?
And , u@@ h , we ruled out men@@ ing@@ i@@ tis
Ok@@ ay . Um ...
I read this one article about something called Ka@@ was@@ aki disease .
They said it can cause a heart attack .
That &apos;s a good one .
It would explain the f@@ ever and the r@@ ash .
You know , they dated in college .
But then her dad died ,
How wei@@ rd is that ?
That people join bow@@ ling le@@ agues ?
The universe kept pul@@ ling them together , just ...
waiting for them to see that they were meant to be together ,
And then a tan@@ ker explo@@ des ,
Ye@@ ah .
Your par@@ am@@ edi@@ c is gon@@ na be fine , by the way .
O@@ oh , B@@ ail@@ ey .
You have to map me .
I need to know which parent I take after .
My dad e@@ ats three sal@@ ads a day and has high chol@@ ester@@ ol .
He managed to sn@@ ap his el@@ bow
C@@ alli@@ e , I asked for an or@@ th@@ o consult ,
W@@ eren &apos;t you supposed to leave hours ago ?
I was , but then .. b@@ aked Alaska .
I &apos;m so sorry .
Well , h@@ ey , look at it this way .
Now you have time to sp@@ ice up your speech for next year .
And I still need an or@@ th@@ o consult
I-@@ I heard one about floating al@@ ga@@ e po@@ ds ,
It was very inspir@@ ing .
Ye@@ ah . Ye@@ ah , and yours is just about , you know ...
car@@ ti@@ lage right now .
But no one s@@ ells car@@ ti@@ lage like you .
You know , this invitation
Ye@@ ah , and I &apos;m telling you that it &apos;s great .
No . You &apos;re telling me it &apos;s not ...
Finally .
And it helps .
I feel better about not going .
I &apos;ll see you in O.@@ R. three .
So any idea when the k@@ id &apos;s dad
He &apos;s pretty fre@@ aked out right now .
No , no idea .
He &apos;s stable , but his hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in is still low .
That a@@ or@@ tic repair took a lot longer than I thought .
Oh , I have to be back on rounds ...
in 29 minutes .
Should I sleep or should I shower ?
I could sleep in the shower .
Oh , but I &apos;m also star@@ ving . Have you e@@ aten ?
Sh@@ oot .
His pressure dropped out and he went into cardi@@ ac arrest .
They seem to sense when the creatures are around .
Where &apos;s Charlie ?
Another novel I won &apos;t have to read .
He saved us , you fu@@ cking as@@ sh@@ ole .
I know what you think of me , what everybody thinks of me .
You know , in the divor@@ ce petition .
my first wife said that to call me a cre@@ ep would be an aff@@ r@@ ont to cre@@ eps everywhere
Think I would have loved them .
Maybe .
And then Ly@@ dia .
Third time really was the charm for me .
She was the k@@ indest person I ever met .
But I &apos;m here and she &apos;s gone . You know why that is ?
Because , in the end , there are only two types of people .
The as@@ sh@@ ol@@ es and the dead .
God , you sound like my father .
Like your father ? Why ?
Tar@@ get mobile .
Tar@@ get heading north .
Alpha 1 &apos;s now Bra@@ vo 1 .
He &apos;s mobile . Roger that .
Out of the way . Mo@@ ve , move , move .
May I bor@@ row this ? Thank you .
Now complete on Bra@@ vo 1 , following Bra@@ vo 1 .
Alpha 1 now on Fo@@ x@@ tro@@ t . I &apos;m in pursu@@ it .
Get off me ! G@@ ome on .
The ank@@ le &apos;s sh@@ atter@@ ed . You &apos;ll need to carry me .
Come on . Get over me shoulder .
Sorry . Get in .
H@@ ey ! Mo@@ ve away from the car .
Soon as I &apos;ve printed your ticket .
Come on .
It f@@ ills the frac@@ tures in my ank@@ le ,
Why , what happened to your ank@@ le ?
You fell on it .
Hello .
I didn &apos;t do it .
I need your help .
If I help you , I &apos;ll be arrested .
If you don &apos;t , I could be dead by the end of the day .
All right , listen .
L@@ ed@@ ford activated someone called Ch@@ il-@@ something .
That &apos;s all I know .
Chil@@ cot@@ t ? Oh , Jesus , he &apos;s a psych@@ op@@ ath .
That &apos;s a kill order . Oh , God .
Jo@@ die , I need you to do something for me .
I need you to find out the identity of the man
If I can find him , it will clear my name .
Can you do that ?
I &apos;ll try .
Se@@ b , can I press this red button ?
That says 200@@ ,@@ 0@@ 16 .
No , it says 2016 .
That &apos;s 198@@ ,000 years from now .
In that case , I got two zer@@ oes for free , so who &apos;s the idi@@ ot ?
What are you doing ? I need to disappear .
There are people looking for me .
You won &apos;t see me again .
We were trying to return that beautiful ball
It &apos;s not about the ball , l@@ ads .
Look , Se@@ b . That &apos;s the couple that &apos;s adop@@ ting us .
They &apos;re from London .
You &apos;re coming with me . Right , Nob@@ by ?
Of course .
I &apos;d never leave my little brother .
It &apos;s all right to be sad .
What ?
It &apos;s imperative no one know that I &apos;m here .
You need somewhere isolated where there &apos;s no one around ?
Ex@@ ac@@ tly . All right .
I know just the place .
It &apos;s just this way , past the train station .
All abo@@ ard the 9@@ 15 , Gri@@ m@@ s@@ by to London .
In you go .
Do you think our new parents will let us sleep
If we have b@@ unk beds , can I have the top ?
You can have the top , little man .
Go and have a pe@@ e now before the other passengers do .
L@@ ads . L@@ ads .
See those blo@@ kes out there ?
Those are Manchester United supporters .
How d@@ are those tw@@ ats show up here ?
Del@@ ay them . I promise I &apos;ll burn your school down .
No school ! Come on .
O@@ i , l@@ ads . Get the ball !
Let &apos;s go , l@@ ads .
They &apos;ve got g@@ uns !
Exc@@ use me , si@@ r . I think you dropped something .
Dro@@ pped what ?
You &apos;re in Gri@@ m@@ s@@ by now , you g@@ it !
Do you think I &apos;ll hesitate to kill you ? Little b@@ ast@@ ard .
Now !
Get over here . What is it ?
I need you to su@@ ck this wo@@ und in my shoulder .
No , no , no , I don &apos;t put my lips on another man &apos;s shoulder .
That &apos;s very g@@ ay . Do it now .
People have been ch@@ u@@ cked out of Gri@@ m@@ s@@ by
That pel@@ let was filled with L@@ onom@@ ia c@@ ater@@ pillar tox@@ in .
I &apos;ll be dead in 90 seconds if you don &apos;t su@@ ck it out .
Ok@@ ay , ok@@ ay .
Su@@ ck hard .
That &apos;s it .
Don &apos;t swal@@ low the po@@ ison .
And now sp@@ it it out .
Well done . Pra@@ ise the Lord .
I thought I &apos;d lost you , brother .
What ? I &apos;ve been hit somewhere else .
Where ?
I &apos;m not falling for that one . No way .
No , you don &apos;t .. What are you doing ?
No , why are you taking those off ?
It &apos;s a sem@@ i@@ final that has become gri@@ pped by tension .
And England to have the ball . Time for one last attack , baby .
Come on , Ster@@ ling . The ball &apos;s broken for Ster@@ ling .
Get in there . Rah@@ e@@ em Ster@@ ling &apos;s through .
And Rah@@ e@@ em Ster@@ ling scores for England !
That surely puts England
Here we go !
We sp@@ it on your face !
Here we go ! Here we go !
Ma@@ el@@ strom are clearly buying something from him .
He &apos;s currently in a hotel room with L@@ ina S@@ mit , his wife ,
You need to find out from her . You may need to se@@ duce her .
Well , as you know , I &apos;ll do anything for England .
Book me a room at the lo@@ dge .
I have done . Your ali@@ as is Mr. Shel@@ ton .
H@@ ey , English . What ?
I have something for you to celebrate :
I &apos;m embar@@ rass@@ ed to say I &apos;ve never actually tried any before .
You &apos;ll like it . Listen ,
Are you on e-mail or ... ? Linked@@ l@@ n .
Yes .
Who &apos;s that you were talking to ?
That is me new m@@ ate , Tab@@ ans@@ i .
He flies to and from South America
It &apos;s either that or a life of crime .
Or as I like to call it , World@@ C@@ ure .
At the end of the game ,
It should take two to three weeks
By which time , 96@@ ,000 fans
Why are you doing this ?
Well , think about it .
We have 7 billion people running around
I &apos;m just trying to make the world
By del@@ eting the sur@@ plus .
&quot; C@@ ure the world . &quot;
The g@@ arb@@ age .
What ? Every man , woman and child in this stadium is about to die .
Put this in your ear .
Jo@@ die , I need you to check for anywhere
Ok@@ ay , I will scan for the chemical signature .
This is hop@@ eless .
No , it &apos;s not .
Look who just sat down .
We need to stop her before she sets off the virus .
All right , listen , let &apos;s go around the stadium .
We can &apos;t go around . There &apos;s not enough time .
We need to go across the pitch .
P@@ itch invasion .
To@@ o much security .
Men and women of Gri@@ m@@ s@@ by , listen up .
This is important .
You see that lass over there ?
What ? Shar@@ on Os@@ bourne ?
No . She &apos;s gon@@ na release this de@@ adly virus ,
So we &apos;re sc@@ um , are we ?
Well , let me tell you something about sc@@ um :
Ye@@ ah .
It &apos;s sc@@ um who die in the wars
Ye@@ ah ! It &apos;s sc@@ um that keep
Ye@@ ah !
So I ask you to join with us now
Let &apos;s put this up , Chris .
Ok@@ ay , the smartphone &apos;s connected to the Wi-Fi . Re@@ ady .
Wa@@ it , wait , wait .
Beg@@ inning to lift the craft .
Take the controller .
I want you to notice these marks on my fingers .
All right , cutting off power now .
Du@@ de , you &apos;re getting into M@@ IT !
These marks on my hand are read
It allows my hands to manip@@ ulate this craft
The Weather Service has issued a ts@@ un@@ ami warning
Come on , guys . We got@@ ta go !
We got@@ ta go ! We got@@ ta move fast !
We got@@ ta get to Daniel &apos;s building
All right , hold on ! We got@@ ta get over it before it cre@@ sts !
Come on !
We &apos;re gon@@ na make it .
He &apos;s responsible for the power transfer .
And you know Pow@@ ell .
He &apos;s super@@ vis@@ ing the security over@@ ride .
It &apos;s a big job .
Perhaps we should call in David B@@ aker .
Just to be safe .
That won &apos;t be necessary .
We can do this all in-@@ house , hu@@ h ?
And S@@ cy@@ lla will be gone by morning .
I promised Bra@@ d I would call his mo@@ m if anything happened .
I &apos;ll do it if you want .
No , it &apos;s ok@@ ay . I &apos;ll do it .
Look at this .
He kept a bad@@ ge from the police benefit .
When he was a CO in Fox River .
h@@ e-@@ he failed the test to get into the ac@@ ademy five times .
These are right , right ?
This is a map of the Company &apos;s bas@@ ement , right ?
I don &apos;t know . It looks too simple .
I assumed it would be a lot more complicated than this .
The M design@@ ates a meter .
This is some sort of con@@ den@@ sing unit .
This is a pl@@ um@@ bing part . It &apos;s called a P-@@ tra@@ p .
They &apos;re all completely dis@@ similar items .
Log@@ ical design dict@@ ates they &apos;d never
It just , um ...
What can I do for you ?
Well , I can see that you &apos;re busy ,
S@@ cy@@ lla is moving .
Come back ?
Don &apos;t worry . We &apos;re gon@@ na stick to our original plan .
What exactly is the plan ?
Yes , and if he reaches
If he gets a tur@@ tle , well ..
The contrac@@ tors are here .
What the hell are you doing here ?
You &apos;re a client , hu@@ h ?
Just keep it down ; keep it down .
It &apos;s all part of the r@@ use .
We need some help . I &apos;m already
Where &apos;s , where &apos;s Pre@@ t@@ ty and the Fat@@ man ?
Bel@@ lick &apos;s dead .
If you jo@@ ke about it , I &apos;ll ri@@ p your tongue out .
Let &apos;s go , Lin@@ c .
Sorry to bo@@ ther you ,
He &apos;s in and out of consciousness
I &apos;d be really grateful if we could see a neuro@@ log@@ ist .
Does he have insurance ?
U@@ h , y@@ e@@ ah .
I don &apos;t have the card ,
Just fill this out .
This won &apos;t just serve the rich .
How long have you been working for them ?
To@@ o long .
I came in in &apos; 94 .
I was never good at collecting a pay@@ check .
Always fre@@ el@@ ance .
Parti@@ ally retired all the time .
I like to finish a job and then move on .
Put it in the past .
Do you always leave your name behind
Only on the S@@ cy@@ lla project .
Well , we &apos;re considering modifications and ..
Come on .
You know what happens ?
They take over your life .
You don &apos;t own it anymore .
That is not what happened to me .
Then , somehow you stayed out of trouble .
No , no , that is not it .
Look , I can handle this .
I &apos;m just ..
I &apos;m just k@@ icking myself .
I could find something else for you to do , ok@@ ay ?
This thing has gotten way out of hand .
What &apos;s wrong ?
You don &apos;t trust me , Fern@@ ando ?
Why should he ?
Because we all want the same thing : S@@ cy@@ lla .
And I &apos;m not gon@@ na let a giant pack
Or would you like me to call the bom@@ b squ@@ ad ?
Look , I am offering to do you a massive favor here .
If that thing b@@ lows while I &apos;m pul@@ ling the pin ,
Now , don &apos;t worry , Fern@@ ando .
I &apos;m known for my ste@@ ady hand .
Take a deep breath , ok@@ ay ?
Keep your weight even .
And I need you to shift slowly ,
Oh , no , I can &apos;t ... I can &apos;t , I can &apos;t do it .
Are you all right ?
They have to de@@ activate .
I got a key .
A legend to the blu@@ ep@@ r@@ int .
B@@ aker gave you this ? No .
His wife gave it to me . They came for B@@ aker .
All right , well , this makes more sense .
These , u@@ h , these symbols
they &apos;re micro@@ phones .
And the letter &quot; V &quot; isn &apos;t for vacuum ,
This is a line of J@@ Z@@ 33 land mines
It says , &quot; Manual over@@ ride only .
There &apos;s a manual over@@ ride .
It &apos;ll cut the power long enough for you
How do you know for sure ?
I found David B@@ aker .
Su@@ c@@ re . Step off .
You can do it . You only have
I can &apos;t ... Yes , you can . Yes , you can .
Michael and I figured it out .
Step off right now .
I know you &apos;re K@@ ate &apos;s friend , Hum@@ ph@@ rey .
But by next spring , she will be a trained Alpha ,
No doubt you &apos;ll be a cle@@ ver Om@@ ega .
Learn to keep the peace .
And Hum@@ ph@@ rey ,
But . But ..
Gu@@ ys , lower the boo@@ m !
Hum@@ ph@@ rey , we don &apos;t have time for fun .
Gu@@ ys , guys , come on . Don &apos;t get your fur in a b@@ unch .
You wol@@ ves are making us look bad . Come on , the c@@ arib@@ ou are laugh@@ ing at us .
Now , that &apos;s a moon I don &apos;t want to h@@ ow@@ l to .
Western h@@ unt group , get back to the den .
The two of you , 90 home .
Now !
Om@@ eg@@ as , good job .
Great . My first h@@ unt , and I ble@@ w it .
K@@ ate , K@@ ate , K@@ ate , K@@ ate , K@@ ate .
Don &apos;t beat yourself up . That &apos;s crazy . You were amazing .
I mean , if anyone &apos;s hung@@ ry , they can eat
They can always eat
They can eat berries .
Ber@@ ries are really nutri@@ tious .
Ye@@ ah . Tell that to a hung@@ ry pack .
The Eastern Wol@@ ves ru@@ ined K@@ ate &apos;s h@@ unt .
Lu@@ ck@@ ily , the Om@@ eg@@ as were there to break up the fight .
So , you think you can do better ?
Please .
The next girl that comes up the hill , she &apos;s mine .
I &apos;ve never seen her look that good .
K@@ ate is hot .
I &apos;ll be right back .
H@@ ey .
Where do you think you &apos;re going ?
Hum@@ ph@@ rey , you know the rules .
You &apos;re not allowed to h@@ ow@@ l with her . She &apos;s an Alpha .
We can eat together .
But we can &apos;t , you know , h@@ ow@@ l together .
Gu@@ ys , I know . I .. I was just .
K@@ id@@ ding .
Che@@ er up , bud@@ dy . You still got us .
Friends for life !
We &apos;re going to un@@ ite the p@@ acks .
Welcome back , Hum@@ ph@@ rey .
Good job bringing her home .
W@@ ow@@ . it &apos;s a big crowd .
Ye@@ ah . Good times .
So I heard you and Gar@@ th spent some time together .
L@@ il@@ ly .
Sorry .
I &apos;m sure he &apos;s perfect mar@@ rying material .
Hum@@ ph@@ rey .
We should be going .
Yes , yes .
Exc@@ use me . A fle@@ a .
And a little something for your big day .
Thank you .
Just wanted to say goo@@ d-@@ b@@ ye .
Goo@@ d-@@ b@@ ye ?
Ye@@ ah . I &apos;m thinking about doing a little traveling ,
And maybe I &apos;ll visit our friends the bears .
Our old bud@@ dies , see how they &apos;re doing .
I &apos;ll tell them you said hi .
Wa@@ it . But you &apos;re leaving Jas@@ per ?
Ye@@ ah . You know , it &apos;s alone wol@@ f thing .
I know Hum@@ ph@@ rey , the fun@@ -@@ loving Om@@ ega ,
So I &apos;ll be a fun@@ -@@ loving l@@ one wol@@ f .
I don &apos;t doubt that .
Did he give you any clu@@ es , any coordinates , anything ?
I saw this coming a few years back .
I had a vision . I didn &apos;t w@@ anna believe it .
Th@@ ought I was dre@@ aming .
Tony , I &apos;m gon@@ na need you to focus .
And I needed you .
As in , past ten@@ se .
That tr@@ umps what you need . It &apos;s too late , bud@@ dy .
Sorry .
You know what I need ? I need a s@@ have .
And when he worked , he talked about his Great Plan .
Even dis@@ assembled , I wanted to please him .
I &apos;d ask ..
where would we go once his plan was complete ?
And his answer was always the same .
&quot; To the Garden . &quot;
So , where is he ?
When Th@@ an@@ os sn@@ apped his fingers ...
Earth became ground zero for a power sur@@ ge
No one &apos;s ever seen anything like it .
Until two days ago ...
on this planet .
I was in a place called the qu@@ antum realm .
The qu@@ antum realm is like its own micro@@ scop@@ ic universe .
To get in there , you have to be incredibly small .
Hope . She &apos;s my , um .
She was my ...
She was supposed to pull me out .
Cap .
Sorry , bud@@ dy , we got a problem .
Ye@@ ah , we do .
Well , what are we gon@@ na do now ?
You know what ? Give me a break , Steve .
I just got hit in the head with the H@@ ul@@ k .
You said that we had one shot .
This was our shot .
We shot it . It &apos;s shot . Six stones or nothing .
It was six stones or nothing .
You &apos;re repe@@ ating yourself ,
You &apos;re repe@@ ating yourself . You &apos;re repe@@ ating yourself .
Du@@ de . Come on !
No . You never wanted a time hei@@ st .
You weren &apos;t on board with the time hei@@ st .
I dropped the ball .
You ru@@ ined the time hei@@ st .
Is that what I did ?
Ye@@ ah .
No , no , no , there &apos;s no other options .
There &apos;s no do-@@ over@@ s .
We &apos;re not going anywhere else . We have one particle left .
Each .
That &apos;s it . All right ? We use that ..
by@@ e-@@ b@@ ye , you &apos;re not going home .
Ye@@ ah , well , if we don &apos;t try ...
then no one else is going home , either .
I got it .
We have a potential bre@@ ach .
I said bring them in .
They &apos;re trying , ma &apos;@@ am , but Brad@@ do@@ ck &apos;s unit
Oh , for the love of ..
I &apos;ll look at the weather proj@@ ections .
It &apos;s not light@@ ning stri@@ kes we &apos;re looking at .
So , where you at with names ?
What is that ?
That is a long-@@ hor@@ ned be@@ et@@ le .
Nick , there &apos;s something else in his mouth ,
Hair . Maybe he got a piece of his att@@ acker .
Gu@@ ys , I &apos;m gon@@ na need some bigger tools .
Ye@@ ah , ok@@ ay .
You check the other one , will you ?
Ye@@ ah , same thing over here .
But these patterns are in@@ consistent with this barb@@ ed wire .
Stop , please stop !
L@@ ooks like som@@ ebo@@ dy brought chains to the party .
Do you see these ab@@ ra@@ sions and cuts here in the chest ?
They appear to have been made by the barb@@ ed wire .
Self-@@ control wasn &apos;t exerc@@ ised
The place was completely tr@@ ashed .
This is all my fault .
I was the one who wanted to get married at the convention .
Where they let anyone in .
All of our friends were going to be here , anyway .
I wanted them to see how happy we were .
Let &apos;s go back to
This is a Co@@ v@@ ens and C@@ lans convention .
V@@ amp@@ ires , and@@ . unfortunately wer@@ ew@@ ol@@ ves .
Mr. Ste@@ wart ..
May I see your hand , please ?
Miss Cr@@ ens@@ ha@@ w ?
We found the same sc@@ ar
In the movies , v@@ amp@@ ires thir@@ st for blood .
No , but seriously , this might
And .. no returns .
Heavy head , cur@@ ved blade about five inches long .
How many of these have you sold ?
N@@ one .
Thank you .
Um , out of cur@@ i@@ osity ...
u@@ h , will you and Det@@ ective V@@ art@@ ann be
Re@@ ally none of your business .
I had love in my gr@@ as@@ p ,
It &apos;s a terrible thing to wake up to every day .
I &apos;ll ... keep that in mind .
Your wol@@ f &apos;s in the system .
His name &apos;s Tim@@ ber .
H@@ mm , how original .
Tim@@ ber , here , joined in on the fight .
Wol@@ ves don &apos;t normally attack humans .
Bl@@ ame the owner , not the wol@@ f .
Who &apos;s the owner ?
Kurt Francis . He &apos;s also in the system .
Dig@@ es@@ tive enz@@ ym@@ es .
Ye@@ ah , someone d@@ rank Michael Wilson &apos;s blood
Ye@@ ah , Kurt Francis .
No . It did not come back to Kurt Francis .
Of course ... A v@@ amp@@ ire .
If we accept the myth@@ ology , wer@@ ew@@ ol@@ ves don &apos;t drink blood ,
So , what was a v@@ amp@@ ire
Don &apos;t they hate each other ?
It in@@ duc@@ es v@@ om@@ iting .
I understand why the wer@@ ew@@ ol@@ ves
why would he turn against one of his own ?
Maybe Michael lost faith .
M@@ av@@ be Michael started to see you for what you really are
Juli@@ e .
You wanted her all to yourself , didn &apos;t you ?
I want a lawyer .
The yellow contact lens
Michael &apos;s blood in Kurt &apos;s car
But without the murder weapon , we can &apos;t prove
So if Kurt and Thomas h@@ acked off Michael &apos;s head ..
The clothes should prove it .
They should .
You know , there should be a lot more blood than this .
All it pro@@ ves
Well , at the least , they were there .
If they only took one or two sw@@ ings ,
He was hit with an ax@@ e at least 18 times ,
Ye@@ ah . Ye@@ ah , another wol@@ f .
Or another v@@ amp@@ ire .
I admit that a black clo@@ ak does l@@ end a gent@@ lem@@ an
There &apos;s just one draw@@ back ..
it dra@@ gs along the ground and coll@@ ects plenty of trace .
What did you find , David ?
It &apos;s a flo@@ wering her@@ b that only grows above 2,@@ 500 feet
We didn &apos;t find any of this stuff at the crime scene .
Mak@@ es me wonder what else is up there .
We know that Michael was running from his att@@ ack@@ ers .
We know that the Ch@@ ase ended
Where did it begin ?
Don &apos;t , stop !
Your beloved used to be a wer@@ ew@@ ol@@ f .
Michael said he &apos;d seen me at the convention last year .
Sa@@ id he knew we were dest@@ ined to be together .
So he changed
Love built on a lie isn &apos;t love .
You can &apos;t be someone you &apos;re not .
He wasn &apos;t one of us .
And that didn &apos;t sit well with anyone .
Did it ?
To@@ o late ! No returns !
That was really intense .
Well , now we know , next time we go to the farmers &apos; market ,
Oh , good . You &apos;re here . I need your assistance .
Can it wait until I put a B@@ and-@@ Aid on a go@@ at b@@ ite ?
What happened ?
Your bud@@ dy got mu@@ gged by some baby farm animals .
Be@@ en there .
So what do you need help with ?
A@@ my &apos;s mad at me , and I &apos;m not clear why .
Ok@@ ay . W@@ ere you talking before she got up@@ set ?
Yes .
That &apos;s probably it .
What &apos;d you say to her ?
Well , I just asked her if I should start watching
And that made her angry ?
Well , Shel@@ don , when you &apos;re k@@ is@@ sing a girl ,
It was . I asked her
Ye@@ ah . I &apos;m t@@ apping out . Leon@@ ard ?
I &apos;m gon@@ na gu@@ ess that your main concern is the time commitment
Oh , no , not just a season .
If I &apos;m in , I &apos;m in for the whole run ,
I &apos;m sorry I &apos;ve up@@ set you .
I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have asked so many questions .
No , it &apos;s ok@@ ay .
Ye@@ ah , maybe it &apos;s good you got US talking about this stuff .
Well , look at that ..
even when I &apos;m causing problems , I make the world a better place .
H@@ ey , next , why don &apos;t we tackle your pen@@ chant for wh@@ ining
U@@ h , Shel@@ don , I think we &apos;re good for now .
Ah , well .. very well .
So does this mean you &apos;ll finally pick a wedding date ?
Here we go again .
Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date ?
We &apos;re committed to each other . We &apos;re happy .
A ceremony isn &apos;t gon@@ na change anything .
So you &apos;re never getting married ?
It &apos;s his wh@@ ining , isn &apos;t it ?
It &apos;s am@@ using that he doesn &apos;t hear it .
Look , all she &apos;s saying is we are in love
E@@ w , 50 ? We &apos;ll be old and gross .
Ye@@ ah , but we &apos;ll be old and gross together .
My a@@ unt and unc@@ le were married 63 years .
Tow@@ ards the end , it was like watching cheese m@@ elt .
Um .. I &apos;m free ton@@ ight .
Are you saying you want to get married ?
Vegas isn &apos;t that far away .
I &apos;m in . Let &apos;s do it .
After all these years .
I &apos;m really happy for the two of you .
Now get out of my spot .

Right .
Good luck .
Howard Jo@@ el Wol@@ ow@@ itz , you get back here .

I want you all to realize that the only thing
And people refuse to believe that it &apos;s in your mind .
And you can feel it when you go into a room ,
Don &apos;t be a child .
Plus , he &apos;s wearing a cap .
And ...
He has over two million followers online .
How many do you have ?
What do you want from me ?
I want you to write again .

Eri@@ ka .
It &apos;s for you .
She &apos;ll be right with you .
I &apos;m gu@@ essing he thinks you st@@ ole this from him ,
That means she moved him to a safe house .
Why ?
Bal@@ der &apos;s program had a fre@@ ak encryption .
He &apos;s the only one who can open it .
That means these guys are going after him next .
I don &apos;t really see how this makes her any less guilty .
She doesn &apos;t have the mon@@ op@@ oly on gu@@ ilt .
You should be looking for this man , too .
What makes you think I &apos;m not ?
Now , if you will exc@@ use me .
Ye@@ ah ?
Do you know this man ?
He has a tat@@ too like yours .
So are you a co@@ p ?
No , worse .
I &apos;m a journalist .
That guy , he &apos;s part of this group .
Heavy people .
Mik@@ ael .
There were two key stories
The first you couldn &apos;t have written without her ,
I think you are sc@@ ared
I &apos;m sorry .
Lis@@ bet@@ h . I haven &apos;t heard of the spi@@ ders .
They sound like the last people on earth
What &apos;s that ?
It &apos;s the answer to &quot; the snow comes early this year . &quot;
So I figure out the big number ,
Father said he made his program based on how I think .
You think I &apos;m a fre@@ ak .
No , I don &apos;t .
Get some sleep .

Fu@@ ck you .
