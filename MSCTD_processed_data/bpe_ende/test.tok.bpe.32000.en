You &apos;re on admin leave until they make a determination on the battery ...
Every@@ body from Chief S@@ oto to the F@@ BI to the whole go@@ d@@ dam@@ n world
What do you mean ?
Just something I saw on oil projects in Saudi .
Rather than guard every project ,
H@@ ang on , what ?
They had built-in acceler@@ om@@ eters
When it got in range of a cell tower , it would start ph@@ oning home .
This looks a lot like the same thing .
Did the H@@ unter@@ s put a cell@@ -based tra@@ cker
U@@ h ... . I don &apos;t know . The wife might &apos;ve done .
He@@ y. listen , can you check with a cell phone company ,
Ye@@ ah , all right , call me back .
Are they gon@@ na run it down ?
Hop@@ efully . I &apos;m not allowed near it for now .
But , Christ , J@@ enny , that &apos;s amazing .
Have you named him yet ?
Well , if he had a name , he &apos;d be mine .
What is it ?
H@@ ey . H@@ ey , wake up .
W@@ ake up .
Sh@@ it .
The last few hits have been near Cal@@ um@@ et .
It must be far from the tower
T@@ akes in half the storage areas south of the city .
No@@ body &apos;s got the man@@ power to search that many storage y@@ ards .
And with the AT@@ F on the fire and Kun@@ z &apos;s und@@ eter@@ min@@ ed call ,
Look , to hell with downtown and the fe@@ ds .
Or@@ ders or not ,
We &apos;re here to help you finish this , Se@@ an .
There &apos;s something I got@@ ta do first .
Thanks .
A cat fall on your head ?
Did you bring the sugar ?
No , I didn &apos;t bring you sugar .
I just came here for one thing .
You &apos;re so mean .
I &apos;m sorry about your Un@@ cle Brian .
Se@@ an , no !
No ! I have a reputation .
I just talked to them about the dragon .
Ok@@ ay , so how were they gon@@ na
Package ?
Why would they talk to me about that ?
Because the language of these people is fire , right ?
Oh . They don &apos;t speak the language of fire .
Not like we do .
Ye@@ ah , you and I don &apos;t speak the same language .
Oh , come on , Se@@ an . Of course we do .
You love to speak with the dragon . So do I .
And the dragon loves to speak with us , and you know it .
You would be seeing another you .
Hi , another me .
All right , look , just level with me .
How are they getting the package out of Chicago ?
I don &apos;t know anything about a package .
Nothing . Ok@@ ay ?
But I will share a story with you ,
God dam@@ n it .
Listen to me , you son of a b@@ itch ,
All right . What story ?
Two guys walk into a building , one walks out .
So , I grab@@ bed a gar@@ dener &apos;s can of mixed fuel ,
But enough that both fir@@ es turned on each other , away from the building
D@@ one .
And yet W@@ ic@@ ek was still consum@@ ed .
Ye@@ ah . He was .
So here &apos;s my question .
What did you feel when W@@ ic@@ ek caught fire ?
Did you want him to burn ?
Did you want to burn them all ?
You have no idea .
Oh . Oh , believe me .
I do .
I do . I do . Se@@ an .
Those two men with the pre@@ tend names ,
Ok@@ ay . What location ?
Given the Kel@@ vin required for ig@@ ni@@ tion was minimal .
Given the constra@@ int of mixed fuel .
That &apos;s what the man said .
Ah . Oh , you &apos;ll need to find a battery for it , and I was never here .
Thank you .
Just keep those dead kids off my desk , hu@@ h ?
Shipping to Nigeria ?
There you are .
A lot of people looking for you .
Come on , come on , come on .

M@@ om doesn &apos;t see human patients .
Besides , Tam@@ my &apos;s mo@@ m says that all the AIDS are in New York ...
Um , Tam@@ my &apos;s mo@@ m believes that Fal@@ con C@@ rest is a real place .
Let &apos;s just stick to science , ok@@ ay ?
Fac@@ ts only .
We do have vi@@ als of HIV ,
Actually hard to contract .
You &apos;ve seen something worse ?
J@@ ason , don &apos;t worry about what you &apos;re seeing on TV .

H@@ ey .

Who would drop a package off looking like that ?
H@@ az@@ let@@ on .
Those research mon@@ key guys ?
Y@@ ep . Well , h@@ ello , Mon@@ key 0@@ 53 .
Wo@@ w . It just gets better .
It looks like a sp@@ le@@ en .
Let &apos;s see what brought you in here today .
What &apos;s wrong ?
It &apos;s not just a sp@@ le@@ en , it &apos;s ...
u@@ h , a blood c@@ lot , I think .
I &apos;m gu@@ essing from sub@@ cut@@ aneous hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ging .
What would cause that ?
The virus , a powerful one .
And , if this is a prim@@ ate , it &apos;s probably SH@@ F .
U@@ h , sorry . Peter &apos;s the virus guy .
Sim@@ ian Hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic F@@ ever .
High@@ ly cont@@ ag@@ ious .
Where ever this guy came from ,
Oh , you &apos;re safe .
It ri@@ ps the hell out of the inside of mon@@ keys ,
We &apos;ll make a few cultures , see what &apos;s going on .
If this mon@@ key has Sim@@ ian F@@ ever , you &apos;re looking for
Dead mon@@ keys make me sad .
I never know how to deci@@ ph@@ er your level of sar@@ cas@@ m .
Well , I gu@@ ess I &apos;d put us at a ..

Not really the p@@ un type , Jahr@@ ling .
Sti@@ ck with ac@@ er@@ bic .
Rom@@ eo , Bra@@ vo , Lima , Fort .
Code Three . Medical te@@ ar , lock two .
Ma &apos;@@ am , are you all right ?
Wh@@ atever it is , it didn &apos;t get me .
Just check the g@@ love .
The cut was there before , but I ..
I &apos;m ob@@ serving blood in the powder .
What the hell were you thinking ?
Sir , we have a duty to war@@ n H@@ az@@ let@@ on .
Why &apos;d you go in there with a cut ?
I don &apos;t even know where to start .
You can get as angry as you want at me later ,
No , because I was using a fresh sample .
Well , there you go .
I mean , how can you be 100 % sure ?
I already have the lab
Col@@ onel , weeks ago , I asked H@@ az@@ let@@ on to send me samples
The package was for my study .
The cells ble@@ w up because they were infected .
I &apos;ve already told H@@ az@@ let@@ on that it &apos;s Sim@@ ian F@@ ever .
What , you really think Coc@@ o J@@ r .
in there has two rare and de@@ adly diseases ?
Look , what &apos;s more likely ?
They sent us samples of SH@@ F , which I &apos;ve been exp@@ ecting for weeks ,
That &apos;s reck@@ less .
No , that .. that &apos;s experience .
I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;m the only one
Look , enough of this cra@@ p , ok@@ ay ?
E@@ bol@@ a ?
I &apos;m gon@@ na need un@@ equ@@ i@@ voc@@ al proof .
I was about to introduce E@@ bol@@ a Z@@ aire to the sample tissue .
I just need to get back in there .
All your samples were com@@ promised during steri@@ lization , ma &apos;@@ am .
It &apos;s protocol .
The patient is a 14-@@ year-old male ...
All right , one second . Exc@@ use me .
Four@@ th day back , and I &apos;m already sc@@ rub@@ bing in
Well , fantastic !
Ye@@ ah .
Can you pick up the kids this afternoon ?
I would , but I have to enter@@ tain all of them .

Let me make some calls for you , please .
Boy ...
You are as per@@ sistent as you are anno@@ ying .
You can walk as fast as you want ,
N@@ either am I .

Ah , the recovery team tex@@ ted ,
H@@ ey , Ros@@ s ?
C@@ ould you run down to the E.@@ R .

We need to get someone from u@@ ro@@ logy down here now .
Don &apos;t you think I tried ? There &apos;s an emergency ,
Dr. Wilson , it feels like I might explo@@ de .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s gon@@ na last 20 minutes .
Dr. A@@ very , I &apos;m
There is nothing you can say after this morning
I have a giant penis .
Of course , now my mo@@ m &apos;s convinced that Step@@ han@@ ie
Du@@ de , you and your rich boy problems .
You know what the worst part is ?
I think she actually likes Step@@ han@@ ie .
Well , so then you need to tell your mo@@ m that .
Stand up for your girl .
That wouldn &apos;t work . She &apos;d just hate her even more .
So what are you gon@@ na do ?
Nothing .
You know , it &apos;s like walking into a hor@@ net &apos;s nest .
You know , you got@@ ta stay still . Let the whole fr@@ enz@@ y die down .
Exc@@ use me .
Sorry . Par@@ don me .
Who knew d@@ r . Sh@@ ep@@ herd was such a big shot ?
What are you doing here ?
You told me to sc@@ ru@@ b in .
The night of the g@@ ala ? At your house , remember ?
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah . That night was so fun .
Ye@@ ah . Don &apos;t worry . I won &apos;t tell anyone what happened .
H@@ ey , um .. it &apos;s a little tight in here .
U@@ h , you could probably be more useful
Oh . Ye@@ ah . You &apos;re probably right .
Ok@@ ay , sweet girl , just one more .
It &apos;s pupp@@ y dog eyes , and I &apos;m not .
These are my regular eyes .
What do you want ?
Your dad passed his stress test .
Yang told me to discharge him .
Good .
S@@ ay it
But when I come back ,
Sorry . I came to see if your dra@@ in output picked up
I can come back later .
You &apos;re not progres@@ sing very quickly here .
They &apos;re all in love with you , and afraid of you .
I mean , you pull your str@@ ings
You said that you would go if I set it up .
You said that you would go .
No , see , I never said that .
That &apos;s against my policy . That &apos;s how you screw up .
You tell someone you &apos;re gon@@ na do something ,
That &apos;s how you lose your home ..
your family . Make your children hate you .
Look , you &apos;re a sweet k@@ id ,
But I don &apos;t want to let you down , too .
All right ?
Ok@@ ay@@ . got that closed up .
Now let me see . Did I miss anything else ?
I don &apos;t see anything .
That &apos;s what &apos;s called a r@@ het@@ or@@ ical question , my dear .
All right , let &apos;s take a look at this penis , shall we ?
U@@ h , Dr. A@@ very , can you elabor@@ ate
I &apos;m fascin@@ ated by all things pen@@ ile .
Yes , I saw evidence of that earlier this morning .
How &apos;s it looking , dear ?
Well , it &apos;s possible he &apos;s gon@@ na need a skin gra@@ ft ,
Ye@@ ah , he &apos;ll be able to stick it in a hor@@ net &apos;s nest ,
wherever they live .
Well , I find that men often put their pen@@ ises
Su@@ ction , dear , come on .
I &apos;m thinking about the patient .
Who@@ a , dial it back for a second .
Does she have a conc@@ ussion ?
No , she &apos;s fine . Are you ?
You &apos;re gon@@ na be wor@@ ried about that
She is my patient ,
Dr. B@@ ail@@ ey knows the procedure .
Sorry .
Prob@@ ably should have checked back earlier .
Your .. white blood cell count is elev@@ ated .
I &apos;d like to start you on antibio@@ tics .
Why do I need antibio@@ tics ?
Because there &apos;s a left shift ?
You need to examine me
Mur@@ phy ..
After I put you in the c@@ ab ,
And you didn &apos;t answer , so I went to check .

Why am I sitting on it ?
It &apos;s in your wal@@ let .
That was the gift .
The phot@@ ograph .
The wal@@ let was just something I could put it in .

Ok@@ ay , let me just say for the record
He was , like , 5 if he was a day .
Yang
why was he there in first place .
I don &apos;t know how he got there .
The patient was coding and
Ro@@ y , your whole crew &apos;s in the waiting room .
They &apos;ll see you after , ok@@ ay ? they &apos;re saying you &apos;re a hero .
Tell him i &apos;m sor@@ ry@@ . tell him i &apos;m so sorry .
Who is he talking about ?
The k@@ id in trau@@ ma 2 .
Ro@@ y he is fine .
Of course i can , i just ... i was having trouble .
Her air@@ way was completely closed off .
I mean , i couldn &apos;t tube her either .
What &apos;s going on ?
There &apos;s too much sw@@ elling in the air@@ way .
Get me a smaller tube , a 6-@@ 0 .
6-@@ 0@@ . here you go .
Dam@@ n it . M
U@@ h , hit the car@@ oti@@ d . H@@ it the car@@ oti@@ d .
And he kept saying something about h@@ itting her car@@ oti@@ d .
Did you give blood today , d@@ r . K@@ are@@ v ?
What ?
You &apos;ve been described as looking ,
I &apos;m asking
A@@ very gave blood , Yang gave blood , Grey gave blood .
I give blood every two months .
Case in point .
Dou@@ che .
Wa@@ it , wait .
Don &apos;t stick me@@ . i got@@ ta go@@ . sorry .
So what was the problem ?
There was a problem .
I came back from seeing the fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ter off to surgery .
He@@ y. u@@ h , my guys would like to line the hall for Ro@@ y
You know , make a show of support .
He &apos;s , u@@ h , 35 years on the job ,
And there was a problem ,
no , i wasn &apos;t w@@ aving at Re@@ ed
H@@ ey , can you give me a hand ?
Som@@ ebo@@ dy page H@@ unt and get me those lab@@ s .
I got her lab@@ s . I was sho@@ cked .
You &apos;re A.@@ K. , right ?
April k@@ ep@@ ner ?
U@@ h , no , no@@ . this is Alex K@@ are@@ v .
Wa@@ it a second@@ . what the hell ?
Her carbon mon@@ oxide level was 28 ,
What the hell ?
B.@@ p. is 69 over 3@@ 2. pul@@ se is 15@@ 8 .
We &apos;re already filling her with flu@@ ids .
They needed more hands .
Keep her on 100 % oxy@@ gen@@ . no , no , do not .
Not until she is more stable .
Crist@@ ina , sc@@ ru@@ b out , go see if you can help@@ . go .
There was so much sw@@ elling , we couldn &apos;t find good v@@ eins .
We had to start a central line .
We can &apos;t use the hyper@@ b@@ ari@@ c chamber Until she &apos;s stable .
Open up , please .
oh , my god .
Ok@@ ay@@ . um , you look good .
These bur@@ ns on your chest are pretty minor .
But the one on your cal@@ f might be third-@@ degree .
You never looked .
You didn &apos;t look in her thro@@ at ,
O@@ h. where &apos;s your m@@ omm@@ y , p@@ al ?
Let &apos;s go find m@@ omm@@ y , hu@@ h ?
When we &apos;re headed toward an outcome
That &apos;s when we go looking for a second opinion .
It &apos;s not the doctors , Richard .
They &apos;re all good doctors .
I know that .
What do you think this was for ?
For J@@ enn@@ ings , it was about legal .
But this was for me .
I needed to know who finally was responsible .
At least I was able to do that .
S@@ ay it , Der@@ ek .
Maybe it &apos;s not one doctor .
Maybe it &apos;s too many doctors ..
Who don &apos;t know each other
When I got to that room ...
There was cha@@ os .
Because that &apos;s the system now ..
Chaos .
Ob@@ s@@ essed with restor@@ ing natural order .
And to fund his operations ,
Titan DNA .
What the hell is someone gon@@ na do with a giant wor@@ m ?
Are you kid@@ ding , Mart@@ ine@@ z ?
What can &apos;t you do with it ?
At 0@@ 500 , we &apos;ll ship out to launch a joint operation ...
I wouldn &apos;t bo@@ ther .
Exc@@ use me ?
So@@ unds like a du@@ ck h@@ unt to me .
U@@ h , Mark , why don &apos;t we let Col@@ onel Fo@@ ster finish ..
A de@@ co@@ y . A di@@ version .
Look , they &apos;ve already got Emma and the OR@@ CA .
Why would they want just this one when they &apos;ve got the keys
The mass ext@@ inc@@ tion we fear@@ ed has already begun .
And we are the cause .
We are the infection .
But like all living organisms ,
Its original and righ@@ t@@ ful rul@@ ers ,
They are part of the earth &apos;s natural defense system .
A way to protect the planet , to maintain its balance .
But if governments are allowed to contain them , destroy them ,
And within our lifetime , our planet will per@@ ish ,
Un@@ less we restore balance .
And what &apos;s gon@@ na be left , if you do this ?
A dead , char@@ red world , over@@ run by mon@@ sters ?
No , Doctor St@@ anton ,
I &apos;m gu@@ essing you weren &apos;t exp@@ ecting these guys .
Moscow , London , Washington , D.@@ C .
all under attack .
On every continent , the Tit@@ ans are trig@@ gering
Now as before , we have been trying to l@@ ure
Their behavior has become random .
Can you track him ?
No . Signal &apos;s too weak .
But maybe she can .
How many nu@@ kes do you have ?
Why ?
We could help him .
This category six hur@@ ri@@ cane over D.@@ C .
is where King G@@ hi@@ dor@@ ah is ne@@ sting .
Working with all four branches of the military ,
So this plan is what you would call a &quot; long shot , &quot; right ?
What do those ner@@ ds think they &apos;re gon@@ na do
You ain &apos;t hear &apos; em , Griff@@ in ?
They w@@ anna bring Go@@ d@@ z@@ illa back from the dead .
We &apos;ll be out of range while you &apos;re down there ,
App@@ reci@@ ate it .
The greater Boston area
All citizens to report to the nearest ev@@ acu@@ ation center
I repeat , all citizens
Mas@@ sive stor@@ ms and other disa@@ sters
And with D.@@ C. hit hard by a category six hur@@ ri@@ cane
The gri@@ m search continues , as people around the world
And though this sight is hear@@ t@@ breaking ,
Cities around the globe have fallen
Why ?
That &apos;s how she made the signal for the OR@@ CA .
The creatures just think it &apos;s another ap@@ ex pre@@ dat@@ or .
Well , that makes sense .
I mean , we are a b@@ unch of hor@@ ny mur@@ der@@ ous car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es .
Ye@@ ah , that &apos;s real po@@ etic . Now what ?
We track it , we find it , and we get my daughter back .
What about Mo@@ e , Lar@@ ry , and Cur@@ ly over here ?
Go@@ d@@ z@@ illa will bring balance .
Oh , boy . Go@@ d@@ z@@ illa &apos;s radiation levels
We got about 12 minutes before he goes ther@@ mon@@ u@@ clear .
What do you mean ?
I &apos;m saying in about 12 minutes ,
Ok@@ ay , guys , you need to find the OR@@ CA ,
I &apos;m impressed .
It &apos;s pretty rare that I don &apos;t manage to ..
Oh , spoke too soon .
I &apos;m gu@@ essing The Bre@@ e@@ ders aren &apos;t singing in praise of the Lord .
Where did you get this ?
I &apos;m done here .
Take a look at the contract ?
Ye@@ ah .
All that &apos;s left is your signature , and we &apos;re good to go .
I think you &apos;re going to do really well here , C@@ amm@@ ie .
Perfect . Now you &apos;re officially a dis@@ cip@@ le of God &apos;s Pro@@ mis@@ e .
Welcome .
Who@@ o !
I want you to put on your clothes and leave .
No , you don &apos;t .
This movie &apos;s wei@@ rd .
I want you to leave .
You knew that was going to happen .
No , I didn &apos;t .
I wouldn &apos;t know what to do .
You can start by putting
I really didn &apos;t know it was going to happen .
Yes , you did .
No , just ..
I didn &apos;t have a choice .
Did you ?
I will not pray for God to change me
Change will come through God
I must be the change .
I &apos;ve always known I didn &apos;t want to act
Then when I learned that that was a sin , also ,
What ?
You can &apos;t get a pass from God to jer@@ k off .
Who asked you ?
Steve , what are you experiencing ?
I mean , just imagine you &apos;re all sitting at a table together
It &apos;s like watching Michael Angel@@ o paint the S@@ ist@@ ine Ch@@ apel .
What ? Why are you laugh@@ ing ? You know I &apos;m right .
That is why I &apos;m laugh@@ ing .
I mean , the system is working on you .
Fu@@ ck you . No , it &apos;s not working on me at all .
O@@ oo@@ h
Please ... Please don &apos;t stop . And so I cry sometimes
A little pec@@ uli@@ ar
And I wake in the morning
And I say , &quot; H@@ ey , y@@ e@@ ah , y@@ e@@ ah , y@@ e@@ ah &quot;
Jam@@ ie , I ..
&quot; Dear Camer@@ on , I &apos;m very angry at you
&quot; You already had this thing in you , but I didn &apos;t .
When I think of how long it took me
What if she &apos;s right ..
What the fu@@ ck ?
You were making a lot of noise .
I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;m fine .
What were you dre@@ aming about ?
I don &apos;t remember , ok@@ ay ? It was sc@@ ary .
Let &apos;s go ! Let &apos;s go , baby . Let &apos;s o !
Maybe the most amazing part of Ad@@ on@@ is Cre@@ ed &apos;s journey , Ro@@ y .
Don &apos;t drop that guard ! S@@ it .
... ... is that ton@@ ight , he f@@ ights ...
Keep your hands up !
Come on , D !
Three years ago , that &apos;s a kno@@ ck@@ out .
Whe@@ el@@ er &apos;s power just isn &apos;t the same , and no doubt Cre@@ ed can sense it .
You got him . Stay on him !
Cre@@ ed &apos;s on a mission , really pressing the issue now .
And a big left h@@ ook lands fl@@ ush !
Cre@@ ed staying in the pocket , Max . Mo@@ ving , not running .
Come on , now ! H@@ ands up ! H@@ ands up !
These two men are really going at it .
Tell him , Don@@ nie !
Another left h@@ ook drives Whe@@ el@@ er back .
Come on , baby !
A@@ in &apos;t nothing personal .
Can &apos;t say I &apos;m proud of what our sport &apos;s become ,
Call it whatever you want .
So@@ unds to me like you just trying to get paid .
The money is a side effect .
&quot; The Rum@@ ble in the Jung@@ le &quot; didn &apos;t just mani@@ fest itself .
Som@@ ebo@@ dy had to make it happen .
Will it into existence .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah , that &apos;s supposed to be you , hu@@ h ?
You see any@@ body else standing here with a care in their heart ?
I want the same thing you want .
Ye@@ ah ? What &apos;s that ?
In the history of bo@@ xing ,
You know that ?
But how many do you think they know ?
Four ?
Five ?
The belt ain &apos;t enough .
You need a narr@@ ative . Some@@ thing that sticks to the ri@@ bs .
Your dad , he knew that .
Cre@@ ed clearly in pain , as he finds a way to his feet .
Not ready to give up yet .
I don &apos;t know . This is getting dangerous , Jim .
Ok@@ ay ! Come to me !
And now , Bay@@ less is gon@@ na let him go again .
Re@@ ady ?
Box !
Hu@@ ge right h@@ ook !
Dra@@ go trying to end it .
And Cre@@ ed delivers a big right hand at the bell .
Get back ! Get back to your corner !
Bay@@ less re@@ stra@@ ining Dra@@ go , se@@ em@@ ingly fru@@ str@@ ated ..
O@@ bey my commands .
You gon@@ na counter with the right
Ex@@ tend the right , cra@@ ck him with the left .
He &apos;ll never expect it . His old man did the same thing to me .
One early observation , Max .
I think Cre@@ ed is with@@ standing Dra@@ go &apos;s combinations
Box .
And round two begins .
Dra@@ go with a huge left h@@ ook .
And a big right hand .
Dra@@ go on the attack again , now driving Cre@@ ed back into the rop@@ es .
Ok@@ ay , can I just point out that &quot; technically &quot; I didn &apos;t di@@ so@@ bey you ?
Er@@ nie .
You said go to the store after school , and I stopped by .
There &apos;s proof ! I left a note !
Ye@@ ah , see ? I didn &apos;t di@@ so@@ bey you . I just took a brief , educational det@@ our !
The way you &apos;ve been like a mother to Or@@ ph@@ an
But you des@@ erve children of your own .
You &apos;ll still look after us though , right ?
I mean , we don &apos;t want those Sar@@ cos s@@ ne@@ aking up on us
Sh@@ h , come on now , don &apos;t worry .
I &apos;m not going anywhere .
All of you are my family .
I &apos;ll protect you from the Sar@@ co Brothers .
And then when my bab@@ ies are big enough , they &apos;ll protect you , too .
They are as wei@@ rd looking as Or@@ ph@@ an is .
They are beautiful .
And they &apos;ll grow up big and strong , like their mother .
Now , everyone , sho@@ o ! My bab@@ ies need their sleep ! Now sho@@ o !
All right , all right .
Now &apos;s our chance .
J@@ ules , come on , we &apos;ll just stay for a little while .
We can set the time machine
.... and M@@ om will never know we were gone !
We won &apos;t get in any trouble !
This isn &apos;t about getting away with something , Er@@ nie !
It &apos;s about going back where we belong !
Max , how do you get this to work
A h !
Well , first you run the initi@@ alization sequence .
But the initi@@ alization sequence won &apos;t even run
What if it fell off while we were going back in time ?
Let &apos;s eat them now
Don &apos;t eat me ! I &apos;m mostly fat !
If we don &apos;t reloc@@ ate soon , we won &apos;t have a choice .
With all the earthqu@@ akes and the rising tar ,
Soon , nothing in the Lower Valley will survive .
And when we get rid of Ty@@ ra , the Upper Valley is ours for the taking
So you better have brought us some good news ,
We &apos;ve got news all right , bos@@ ses .
News you can use .
Ty@@ ra &apos;s had bab@@ ies ! Three of them !
More adop@@ tions ?
No , she said they were her own !
And it looks like there &apos;s another egg still in her nest !
Another egg , hu@@ h ?
If it was taken , she &apos;d come look for it .
And then we can take care of her , once and for all .
My bab@@ ies &apos; first night of life .
I can &apos;t wait to teach them everything I know .
Like something &apos;s been checking it out .
I can &apos;t tell where they go .
J@@ ules , come here !
They &apos;re coming from the river !
Come on ! Let &apos;s follow them .
H@@ ey , M@@ om ! Are you gon@@ na let them leave the nest , hu@@ h ?
Well , I want to see where these tracks lead to .
And it &apos;ll be good practice for them .
Fl@@ et@@ cher will never know it was you who spoke up .
Why would you do this to me ?
Do you think that I would let him put my son through hell
Don &apos;t you know I would never let that happen ?
That there is nothing in the world more important to me than you ?
Don &apos;t you know that ?
Andrew
Hi , and ... I loaded your pan@@ try with G@@ ush@@ ers .
I saw that .
and he &apos;s laugh@@ ed off-@@ stage
He practices .
And he practices and he practices , with one goal in mind
And a year later he goes back to the Ren@@ o .
And he steps up on that stage and he plays the
So imagine if Jones just said .
&quot; Well that &apos;s ok , Charlie
To bird
But that &apos;s just what the world wants now .
Every St@@ arb@@ u@@ cks &apos; Jazz album Just proved my point , really .
There are no two words in English language
You know maybe .. you go to far , you dis@@ courage next
No. man , no .
Because the next Charlie Park@@ er would never be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
I never really had a Charlie Park@@ er .
But I tried
And that &apos;s more than most people ever do .
and I &apos;ll never ap@@ ologi@@ ze for how I tried .
Al@@ right , see you later .
H@@ ey , Andrew .
Listen , I have no idea how you gon@@ na take this , but
You understand what I &apos;m saying ?
then I &apos;ll find you an enemy in a new country .
D@@ one , Sir .
Sir ... I often get this feeling that
You &apos;re right ... for your cooking skills ...
and your ins@@ an@@ ity .
How do you live like this , Tiger ?
This decade old furniture ,
Your sal@@ ary has been lying un@@ touched
why ?
How can I spend when I &apos;m never here ?
I have been traveling all over the world
Wo@@ w .. how much have you saved ?
About 2.3 million .
But your money will rot in the agency &apos;s bank ..
No ... I think you &apos;re old enough to be married now .
No ... I &apos;m not married yet .
Why ?
I don &apos;t get to meet nice girls .
What are you looking for , Mr. Writ@@ er ?
Nothing much ..
Just a sweet simple girl ..
Some@@ one who &apos;d make me want to live only for her .
Wo@@ w ... very romantic ..
Ok@@ ay .
Thank you
Ar@@ en &apos;t you a little f@@ ussy when it comes to food ?
Maybe a little .
So you want to spend some time with Professor K@@ id@@ wa@@ i ?
Yes .... . so that I get to know him better .
I &apos;ll try to speak to him ..
come to his house tomorrow morning .
But I can &apos;t promise anything .
No problem .
Just the way you like it , Sir .
Thank you .
And here &apos;s the ch@@ equ@@ e .
Wh@@ enever you are ready .
I hope you don &apos;t mind if I leave you alone with your p@@ unc@@ tured eggs .
I &apos;m getting late for my play re@@ hear@@ sal . See you later .
You pay the bill .... . why should I ?
Yes , of course ..
Man@@ ish Ch@@ and@@ ra ... . isn &apos;t that a bor@@ ing name ?
I wanted a bor@@ ing name .
should sound like a dec@@ ent guy ... right ?
Look at her gor@@ geous hair ...
Ok@@ ay &apos; dec@@ ent guy &apos; , listen ...
you &apos;ll have to get close to the professor now .
I &apos;m thinking .. people here are so honest ...
they don &apos;t even bol@@ t their doors ...
I should bar@@ ge into the professor &apos;s house
Oh , no ...
like .. have dinner ?
Mr. Writ@@ er .... are you asking me out on a date ?
Date ?
No ... I mean .. we can have a meal ...
I &apos;m going out with my friends ton@@ ight .
Join us ... I &apos;ll let you pay the bill .
S@@ ure .
But I hope you won &apos;t turn up like this ?
Like what ?
Just get a little cool@@ er ..
Keep your foot behind that line .
H@@ ey , everybody ! !
Gu@@ ys listen .. this is my friend Man@@ ish ... he &apos;s from India .
H@@ ey Man@@ ish , it &apos;s your turn ..
Have you ever thrown dar@@ ts ?
Hello .
No problem , Sir .
You know what ? You don &apos;t look like a writer .
For example ..
your hands .. they are not like a writer &apos;s ..
they &apos;re cut and bru@@ ised like a w@@ rest@@ ler &apos;s .
Why did you become a writer ?
Just followed my heart .
Very few people follow their hearts , you &apos;re lucky .
The most important thing for an agent is ...
that he should use his head and not his heart .
The day you follow your heart , consider yourself dead .
I ad@@ mire a man who follows his heart .
Hon@@ est@@ ly , I want to convey something to your daughter
So , Mr Naz@@ ar , what should I do according to your any tips ?
Man@@ ish
H@@ ey , cav@@ eman
I need a drink .
What the hell are you saying ?
Can &apos;t people like us fall in love ?
Of course we can@@ . but not on a mission .
When are we not on a mission ?
And do we have a life beyond these missions or not ?
Mission !
Is Zo@@ ya also ?
and now everyone calls me that .
Tiger is a name meant for dogs .
I war@@ ned you .. in an attempt to wo@@ o her
S@@ ay thank you now ..
Should I tell you something ..
You &apos;ve chosen a nice girl ..
It &apos;s five in the mor@@ n@@ ing@@ . get some sleep ...
it &apos;s her play in the evening .
Sorry ...
Exc@@ use me ?
In ten minutes you &apos;ve destroyed half of Dublin ...
and that agent got away too ... what the hell are you doing , Tiger ?
What else could I have done in that situation ?
And that guy would have come to know that I &apos;m not a writer .
Not just him ... the whole town will know you &apos;re not a writer .
Where will the Professor be right now ?
M@@ ust be watching the play .. what else ?
so let &apos;s create our own world ..
let &apos;s run away , Zo@@ ya .
You have gone mad ... don &apos;t talk non@@ sense .
God alone knows how long our two countries will keep fighting ...
we cannot wait for them end@@ lessly .
And it might be a little difficult to run when we &apos;re old .
Tiger ...
hur@@ ry up .... we have to go to the airport !
Hello ... Zo@@ ya , are you there ?
We &apos;re getting late for the airport .
Please hur@@ ry and come down .
Sir , we can &apos;t get through to Tiger &apos;s phone . He &apos;s out of reach ..
Sir ... I think he &apos;s been kid@@ n@@ apped by the Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ is .
K@@ id@@ n@@ apped ! Non@@ sense !
He &apos;s too good for them .
Listen ... this news should not get out .
Ok@@ ay , Sir .
Take the next flight from London and get here .
Which bank has he with@@ drawn the money from ?
How much ?
Sir ... a total of 47 thousand dollars , Sir ...
47 thousand dollars ?
Sir ... about 2.3 million Ru@@ pe@@ es .
Should be 2.3 million ..
the day I reti@@ re .. I &apos;ll b@@ low it all up .
Tiger has not been kid@@ n@@ apped !
Do you have any idea ...
how much classified information Tiger has about our organisation ?
If anyone gets hold of that information ..
it will compromise the security of our agents all over the world .
Sir ... I don &apos;t know exactly where Tiger is or what he &apos;s up to ...
but he will never give away that kind of information whilst he &apos;s alive ...
I &apos;m certain about that .
Sir ...
we just heard that ...
a Pak@@ ist@@ ani deleg@@ ate is also missing since this morning .
What ?
This is the address of the hotel .
Ok@@ ay .
This hotel belongs to his friend .
He &apos;ll help us book the tickets for tomorrow .
How long will you take ?
M@@ ight take a long .. maybe all night ... you take care .
Sir .... . this is Zo@@ ya .
Sir ?
There are 20@@ 1 countries in the world ..
and bloo@@ dy Tiger could find a girl only from Pakistan ?
Captain Abra@@ r ... why have you called me here ?
Meeting like this can der@@ ail the whole plan .
Because I &apos;m wor@@ ried about you ...
he is an extremely dangerous agent .
I am fine .. but you will all have to be a little more patient .
It &apos;s not that easy to tri@@ ck him .
What you &apos;re saying is right ...
but we must know what you are up to and where exactly are you ?
He does not susp@@ ect me at all ..
but to get him to you here is too ris@@ ky .
I &apos;ll get him to you , but not here ...
for once I followed my heart .
I just wanted to see where this decision would take me .
I &apos;m am@@ used at the thought of what will happen in Kaz@@ akh@@ stan now .
Seen anyone like her ?
See there . . in that car .
They look like bloo@@ dy Indi@@ ans .
Pak@@ ist@@ ani go@@ ons ..
Captain Abra@@ r ...
Sir ... it &apos;s been close to four hours since the Istanbul flight land@@ ed ..
and no one has shown up .
Al@@ right ...
Sir@@ . the information about Kaz@@ akh@@ stan was wrong .
No one arrived there today .
There were two other big flights that left Istanbul yesterday .
One to London and the other to Frankfurt .
Then find out from there how many other flights depar@@ ted ..
Sir .... there are 6@@ 23 flights at London
total number of passengers 8@@ 25@@ ,@@ 8@@ 02 ...
and those two could be traveling on a passport of any nation@@ ality ...
I don &apos;t care .
keep searching ... we have to find them .
Sir ... my point is ...
if Tiger has decided ... then it will be very difficult to find him .
We have created Tiger !
RA@@ W was functioning before him ..
and will continue even after him .
En@@ ough !
What is it that they have and we don &apos;t ?
Five minutes are more than enough ..
I don &apos;t care ... If you have to shoot him ... then do it
So , G@@ op@@ i .... you want me to be shot ?
You des@@ erve to be shot .
What have I done ?
What have you done ?
Tiger , do you know how many countries there are in the world ?
20@@ 1 countries .. there are 20@@ 1 countries and you ..
Re@@ ally ?
Then where is she ?
Call her .. let &apos;s leave .
For that I &apos;ll need you and your boys .
Why ? You just told me that she &apos;s ready .
Yes but those people who she is with right now
Who are they ?
Our friends .
So let me get this straight ..
you want us to attack the IS@@ I in Cuba ...
why .... to kid@@ n@@ ap a girl ?
Girl ?
The same girl was your si@@ ster@@ -in-@@ law in Dublin ...
when you found out she was a Pak@@ ist@@ ani .
you dem@@ oted her from si@@ ster@@ -in-@@ law to just a girl ?
H@@ ey cav@@ eman ...
whatever needs to be done , should be done now
Tiger ... Tiger ... Tiger ...
What the hell is Tiger doing ?
That &apos;s the plan ... Tok@@ as , you will be here .
Sir ... Bab@@ l@@ u .... you &apos;ll be at this point ...
You , cav@@ eman .... . you got an entire army just to catch me ?
Sir ... don &apos;t forget we came here to catch that man
One last time .. you &apos;ll be here .
Tom@@ orrow morning sharp at eight .
Our flight will take off in two hours ...
don &apos;t try anything strange at the airport .
You know what ? You got three coming in .
Get out the back door now , move .
Any@@ body in here ?
Ye@@ ah , we got one coming around the corner now .
Your three guests are coming out of the door behind you right now .
Watch your six .
Oh , Z@@ inger .
Should have brought more bul@@ lets .
I thought they were chocolate spr@@ inkl@@ es which I would eat normally .
But this ta@@ sted like ... there &apos;s no other way to say it really .
Like a rat sau@@ ce .
H@@ ey guys , can you please keep it down ?
Look . Unfortunately there &apos;s ver@@ min in the ceiling again .
Bur@@ ger King was booked up .
Sorry . I &apos;m having dinner with Gal@@ la@@ gh@@ er over here .
Guard your fruit !
You could . You &apos;re funny . Your tim@@ ing is perfect .
Never as funny as you , Super Co@@ oper .
It &apos;s not pink eye , ma &apos;@@ am .
It &apos;s just .. I &apos;m having a bit of a aller@@ gic reaction .
Well , I &apos;m aller@@ gic to dis@@ gu@@ sting childhood illness .
So stay away from me .
Sorry .
Any@@ way , you are right .
After Bo@@ y@@ an@@ ov &apos;s death ,
The ch@@ atter picked up later that night .
What do we know about her ?
I can pull up her file .
Oh , that &apos;s stuck .
So warm in here .
I &apos;ll pull up my file .
Jesus , not on my keyboard , with your pink eye infected fingers .
Why don &apos;t you just cry directly into my mouth while you &apos;re at it .
It really is just a aller@@ gic reaction .
It &apos;s quite but@@ tery .
Wo@@ w . Ok@@ ay , we could order you your own glass .
That was mine !
My life is a disaster .
No , it &apos;s not .
I &apos;m 40 , I live by myself .
I &apos;ve not been in a real relationship since Jer@@ ry left me three years ago
I mean , when I gave up teaching to join the CIA .
I thought everything is going to be different .
I thought I was going to be this amazing sp@@ y .
H@@ ey , you two cu@@ ties sitting here being all cute .
Have an Old Fas@@ hi@@ oned , please .
His service is really slow .
Super slow .
You &apos;re not getting that in the next hour .
Here you go , Miss Wal@@ ker . Thank you .
Any sign of her in the house ?
He@@ at sensors aren &apos;t pic@@ king anything up .
There &apos;s some kind of inter@@ ference .
I don &apos;t like this , T@@ ine .
I &apos;m up for the challenge .
Let &apos;s go in .
Sh@@ oot . There is something wrong with your camera .
Can you switch out for a new one ?
To@@ o late
Her father would never have let himself this exposed .
P@@ ull back , Fine , this is too easy .
I like things that are easy .
Oh my god , Fine .
I don &apos;t know how you do things like that .
H@@ ey . Who &apos;s the finest of them all ?
I don &apos;t know
Dro@@ p your weapon .
Fine , what &apos;s happening ?
Let me gu@@ ess , wh@@ o@@ ever is in your ear wants to know what &apos;s happening ?
E@@ e &apos;s about to die
We need someone to follow De Lu@@ ca without being detected .
And I would hop@@ efully takes us to Ra@@ yn@@ a .
But it can &apos;t be any of you
I go into the fac@@ e-@@ off machine .
Get a whole new face .
I turned up . They &apos;ll never know it &apos;s me .
Do you have quarters ? C@@ ause it cost 50 c@@ ents .
What , I &apos;ve got to pay ?
No , because it doesn &apos;t exist !
Yes , it does !
I &apos;m pretty sure that they &apos;re pul@@ ling your leg
Seri@@ ously . You got to cut that out .
Jesus , look .
one of us has to go in .
Do@@ esn &apos;t matter if we &apos;ve been exposed .
We &apos;ve all gone deep before , and we always gotten our guy .
Gu@@ ys . This is more than just a kill mission .
Now we get Ra@@ yn@@ a , De Lu@@ ca and some top terrorist leadership
We just need someone who could shadow them without attrac@@ ting attention .
Ms. Cro@@ cker , I would really like to do this .
For T@@ ine
I don &apos;t have any cats !
You &apos;re not seriously considering this , are you ?
Look here , Bet@@ ty .
Ford , if you call me Bet@@ ty Cro@@ cker ,
Not only did I become a citizen and take a v@@ ow to protect this country .
I also took a V@@ ow to av@@ enge my fallen com@@ ra@@ des . We all fu@@ cking did .
H@@ o , I didn &apos;t . Not me .
I &apos;m pretty sure we all took a fu@@ cking V@@ ow .
I remember it .
I remember raising my fu@@ cking hand and saying some sh@@ it .
If you think , I &apos;m going to sit by
You might as well accept my resign@@ ation now .
It &apos;s amazing . That is really super cool .
This anti-@@ fung@@ i spray can free@@ ze and dis@@ able any security system .
Wo@@ w . That is quite an image to be carrying all over Europe .
It &apos;s also a pepper spray .
Why not , just make it look like pepper spray .
It &apos;s a
I wouldn &apos;t know . I don &apos;t have that problem .
I don &apos;t have that problem .
If you ever feel like you &apos;ve been po@@ is@@ oned .
Che@@ w one of these .
Have I done something to you , to up@@ set you or
Finally .
Every agent gets a night vision scope hidden in their watch .
Ok@@ ay . I &apos;ve read about this , I &apos;ve even looked it
That is Bet@@ te Mid@@ ler and Barbara Her@@ sh@@ ey .

I would imagine a lot if you have the watch .
H@@ ey P@@ at , I &apos;m flying .

Ma &apos;@@ am , I really think I can do this .

It was a jo@@ ke . There is no gun .
They said you would no longer be ne@@ eding one .
Good grav@@ y . Was Pep@@ e Le Pe@@ w not available ?

I &apos;m ro@@ oting for that guy . I want him to win .
I &apos;m jo@@ king Sus@@ an , don &apos;t report me .
Let &apos;s set up camp in the pa@@ stry shop behind you .
According to our data De Lu@@ ca sp@@ ends all night at the casino .
I &apos;m going in , N@@ ancy .
Sus@@ an , you heard E@@ la@@ ine .
Track and report . No contact .
I &apos;ll track De Lu@@ ca inside , and then I &apos;ll report .
And if he initi@@ ate contacts with me ,
Sus@@ an , your cat lady look is not going to fit in , in there .
That &apos;s right . F@@ enny Morgan is gon@@ na burn her cat T-@@ shirt
This is full-@@ blow@@ n ro@@ gue .
You guys are terrible .
I really hope De Lu@@ ca is still in there , for your sake .
And they &apos;re not going to rei@@ m@@ bur@@ se you for that .
You should &apos;ve gone to cheaper stores , Sus@@ an .
Ok@@ ay . I &apos;m going offline , N@@ ancy .
Two , three .
She doesn &apos;t seem so bad .
Cand@@ y ?
Scre@@ w you and your cand@@ y .
She &apos;s terrible .
All right .
E@@ ver notice how my sister &apos;s a jer@@ k ?
I , um
You know , &quot; Let him be happy &quot; ? What about me , you know ?
Every@@ body &apos;s making these huge life decisions ,
How I &apos;ll feel , you know ?
I &apos;m supposed to be such a big part of their lives ,
You know , starting up new families
But I don &apos;t have to teach him what to care .
Do you even have the authority to ban someone from N@@ IC@@ U ?
I don &apos;t know .
Oh , oh , oh
That &apos;s ok@@ ay .
I just came by to tell you that you were wrong .
Those , u@@ h , pe@@ an@@ ut butter c@@ ups got me no@@ where .
You &apos;re kid@@ ding .
Gu@@ ess you over@@ estimated that A@@ very sp@@ ark@@ le , hu@@ h ?
I think it &apos;s right that you continue her work .
But I really just want to cure her disease .
l want a house
built of old
You could paint it any color
I was star@@ ing at Mount Everest , and I was ready to climb .
I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;m not really comfortable talking about this .
So , my legs were on his shoul@@ ders .
It was a lovely evening .
And my feet were , like , way up in the air ,
And it was worth it .
Oh , my God , it was so worth it , until
B@@ oom !
Then her legs .. sn@@ apped .
It was@@ . terrible .
It was terrible !
But this is way worse .
Ok@@ ay , her pain &apos;s still not controlled .
She &apos;s ma@@ xed out on me@@ ds .
We &apos;ll have to reduce her under general .
I needed to confirm that she with@@ held information
that she legally committed fraud , and she did .
And now
Don &apos;t stop . Don &apos;t hesitate .
You can &apos;t be sc@@ ared of what &apos;s next .
Can you just let me in ?
Well , all right , but I don &apos;t see this as a promising endeav@@ or .
Ok@@ ay , here &apos;s the deal .
We are going to throw le@@ on@@ ard a k@@ ick@@ -@@ ass
I hardly think so .
Leon@@ ard made it very clear he doesn &apos;t want a party .
Did someone say ... &quot; party &quot; ?
He just doesn &apos;t know he wants one &apos; cause he &apos;s never had one .
I supp@@ ose that &apos;s possible , but for the record ,
Howard ,
Fin@@ e. if I do have a thre@@ es@@ ome , you can &apos;t be part of it .
If you make a mark in a min@@ t com@@ ic book , it &apos;s no longer min@@ t .
Shel@@ don , do you understand the concept of black@@ mail ?
Well , of course , i .. oh .
Ye@@ ah , I have an idea .
Let &apos;s throw le@@ on@@ ard a k@@ ick@@ -@@ ass birthday party .
That &apos;s not the secret kno@@ ck .
This is the secret kno@@ ck .
what difference does it make ?
The whole point of a secret kno@@ ck is to establish a
Is that ra@@ i and h@@ ow@@ ard ?
P@@ ossi@@ bly , but unver@@ i@@ fied .
Will you just let us in .
So what &apos;d you get the birthday boy ?
Well , ra@@ i got him an a@@ wesome ,
And I got him this amazing auto@@ graph@@ ed copy
Nice .
I got him a swe@@ ater .
Ok@@ ay , well , he might like that .
I &apos;ve seen him get chil@@ ly .
Shel@@ don , I didn &apos;t see your present .
That &apos;s because I didn &apos;t bring one .
Why not ? don &apos;t ask .
The entire institution of gi@@ ft-@@ giving makes no sense .
Friends give each other presents .
I accept your premis@@ e ; I reject your conclusion .
Try telling him it &apos;s a non-@@ optional social convention .
What ?
Just do it .
Fin@@ e. it &apos;s out of the washer !
I &apos;ll call you when it &apos;s in the dryer .
What do you think ?
Um , that one .
Because of the two additional e@@ ther@@ net ports ?
Su@@ re@@ .@@ He doesn &apos;t need them .
He &apos;s already got a si@@ x-@@ port e@@ ther@@ net switch .
Oh , ok@@ ay , then this one .
Why ? I don &apos;t know .
The man on the box looks so happy .
p@@ enny , if I &apos;m going to buy le@@ on@@ ard a gift ,
Water ! need water ! I &apos;ll be right back .
p@@ enny , listen , I &apos;ve got a problem .
Ye@@ ah , well , so do i .
Look , you got@@ ta st@@ all le@@ on@@ ard a little longer .
I don &apos;t think I can .
You have to@@ . we all have to be there at the same time to y@@ ell surprise .
Ok@@ ay , you have to understand something .
We &apos;re in a hospital right now .
Why ? is le@@ on@@ ard ok@@ ay ?
Leon@@ ard &apos;s fine . I &apos;m fine .
Thanks for asking , by the way .
Ok@@ ay , I don &apos;t need your attitude .
Listen , just hold him there a little longer .
Look , I &apos;ve done my best ,
O@@ k , , how about this ?
You keep him there a little longer , and when you get to the party ,
Don &apos;t toy with me , woman .
I got a hot former fat girl with no self-@@ est@@ e@@ em ,
Th@@ y will be done .
Well .
well , maybe there &apos;ll be more planes double-@@ checking or ships ?
What the hell are they telling you in boot camp ?
We are at war , Al@@ dri@@ ch .
We &apos;re in the vicinity of enemy nav@@ al forces .
We get one quick look at best .
Po@@ ckets , everything , p@@ ile it on the shirt .
G@@ ot two magazines .
I got my pocket knife .
Keep that in your pocket . The last thing we need is a hole in this raft .
Pair of p@@ liers , bit of wire ,
Here &apos;s a whi@@ st@@ le .
Al@@ dri@@ ch .
take another dri@@ ft set . That &apos;s not how I &apos;m reading those wave tops .
Yes , Chief .
15 degrees . S@@ ame read as the out@@ bound , Chief .
If that &apos;s correct , then she &apos;s east . I had her west .
Al@@ dri@@ ch ?
No , thanks .
See , that &apos;s why you got to do it last
It &apos;s beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
Be better if we could eat it .
I was doing all right , see . I didn &apos;t expect no , &quot; A. &quot;
No , it was another one .
I thought I ought to get a &quot; B &quot; or any@@ ways a &quot; C &quot;
marks in school as long I learned the stuff .
And I had this course down good .
I saw that report card , and saw that big sh@@ iny &quot; F. &quot;
So what &apos;d you do ?
I just walked out of school and never went back .
And you had that course down good , you reck@@ on .
You bet I did .
A@@ in &apos;t there a rule ?
A guy can have a hand@@ ful and still be ok@@ ay ?
Su@@ cks the water right out of your bra@@ ins , they say .
Com@@ ing up on 120 hours .
Five days , not a si@@ p .
Al@@ dri@@ ch ? More like sou@@ theast two to three ?
Ye@@ ah , affir@@ m@@ ative .
Ok@@ ay , then .
Here we are , by dead reck@@ oning .
Then where are we headed ?
With luck , right here .
Those islands I told you about , there &apos;s a chain of &apos; em to our southwest .
Clos@@ est friendly land in the Pacific .
Now if this favor@@ able wind will just push us there .
What if it just keeps shi@@ fting , Chief ?
The chart don &apos;t take us no@@ where .
Un@@ less .
No , you won &apos;t , Tony .
You want a dam@@ n watch so bad ?
Why don &apos;t you sit here star@@ ing at nothing all day ?
I do my share . More .
What &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
Who do you think is navig@@ ating this ship ? Are you ?
Then where are these islands you told us about ?
K@@ id@@ neys would be easy .
Ye@@ ah , one for each man .
I think we need some other kind of talk .
I &apos;m trying . But everything &apos;s so far away .
Just remembered something .
My wife ..
she had a pretty yellow dress .
She burned a hole in it with her c@@ igar@@ ette .
So she se@@ wed a little white do@@ ve over the hole .
I can picture the dress and the do@@ ve .
But I can &apos;t really see her face .
Tony .
I do believe I am in love with your sister .
You &apos;ll make a great couple .
I want you boys to know ... .
So , take a look at the tim@@ eline here on Fut@@ u@@ rec@@ ast ...
... clouds are going to start to build ,
As we get deeper into the afternoon , though ,
2 : 00 to 4 : 00 p.m. , you can see a few ...
I don &apos;t know much .
What I do know is this :
A very good woman .
And she was always there for her family .
Do not forget ,
All of us .
Death , however ,
Therefore , let us all pray for her soul .
Pra@@ y that she cross@@ es over to where she needs to go .
And she wants to do a bra@@ ve , no-@@ mak@@ eup role .
Without a co-@@ star .
J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence wants to play me ?
J@@ ig@@ ga j@@ ig@@ ga dam@@ n !
So you want to sleep over again ton@@ ight ?
Think your mo@@ m will let you ?
Maybe . She let me get a job at five .
And it was a boy and his n@@ ana .
I &apos;ve sat next to people before at dinner .
They kind of make you at the shel@@ ter .
Wine that &apos;s not from a box ?
Any@@ way , how was &quot; The Price Is Right &quot; ?
Did you get to meet the host , I want to say
It &apos;s Dre@@ w Car@@ ey , and he gets hou@@ se@@ wi@@ ves wet
Bob ! We &apos;re over here .
Oh , h@@ ey there , hot shot .
Is that my date Bob , or a different Bob ?
I need that to be a different Bob .
I think that &apos;s the very first Bob .
It was Adam , Eve , and Bob .
Carol@@ ine , this is Bob .
Bob , meet Carol@@ ine Ch@@ anning .
Nice to meet you .
Not a lot on top .
I hope he means I &apos;m st@@ up@@ id .
If me and Rand@@ y are Ma@@ y-@@ December ,
Get@@ ting any ideas ?
Ye@@ ah , that I want to die before 60 .
Any@@ body want to do a little b@@ low ?
I &apos;m gon@@ na pass .
We have to be careful , Bob .
Step out of line .
I &apos;m just glad to be out of the house .
Wa@@ it here . You &apos;re both in the mix .
Practice being excited to meet Dre@@ w Car@@ ey .
He knows when you &apos;re f@@ aking it .
My Bob never knows when I &apos;m f@@ aking it .
Keep it up . I like your pepper .
Max ! I &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
What are you doing here ?
This isn &apos;t a scene in the movie .
I know , because I &apos;m in it .
Max , there would be no movie without you .
I would &apos;ve been here so@@ oner ,
He lost $ 50,000 ,
But Bob and I talked a lot about friendship on the helicop@@ ter@@ .@@ sh@@ v@@ s@@ ash@@ .com
And you and I are not gon@@ na be
Or S@@ ophie and G@@ w@@ yn@@ eth Pal@@ tro@@ w !
I was going to name my first-@@ born &quot; Apple , &quot;

They actually want me here .
But I want you there .
I &apos;m the st@@ up@@ id you should be with .
All right , screw it .
S@@ ophie , I &apos;m gon@@ na go with her .
Why stop making bad decisions now ?
It &apos;s 6 : 00 ! How long have you been kne@@ eling there ?
I don &apos;t know ,
B@@ ree ...
Will you do me the honor ..
May I say something first ?
After that embar@@ rass@@ ing night in the restaurant ,
Ex@@ ac@@ tly .
It &apos;s just so soon to be talking about marriage .
Maybe I can use this as a tiny n@@ ap@@ kin ring .
Wa@@ it !
So am I making too much out of this ?
I mean , it happened 20 years ago ,
Ye@@ ah , he is , but ...
even good guys make mistakes if the circumstances are right .
Inter@@ esting point . W@@ ish you h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t made it
Sus@@ an , I am in the middle of no@@ where .
The only female I &apos;ve seen has ant@@ lers .
So should I tell Lyn@@ ette ?
Well , not just yet .
Maybe just keep an eye on the situation .
Thanks for the advice .
Just so you know , when you come home ,
Her name is Car@@ ol .
Oh .. just ..
having a sad day .
You &apos;ve been having a lot of sad days . Is it because Grace left ?
Why would you say that ?
That was when you started being sad .. the day she went away .
I suggested she leave the lane for a while .
The taxi picked her up this morning .
Oh , my god . So why ... why are you telling me this ?
Because I have a little pro@@ position for you .
And given how the neighb@@ ors feel about you these days ,
Some@@ one sold you their house ?
Oh , yes .
We sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have sold .
We should have just gone under
Which would have been very noble and very st@@ up@@ id .
Mit@@ zi sold . She &apos;s not gon@@ na be around
Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t have a choice .
What the hell ?
Mit@@ zi , what are you doing here ?
I live here . Oh , I gu@@ ess you would have noticed ,
But we thought you left .
This guy says he has a job for me in the city .
P@@ uts me up in a nice hotel , and then he never showed .
Hu@@ h , and I got stuck with the minibar charges .
So , wait . You didn &apos;t sell your house to Paul Young ?
What ?
Please . I &apos;m not gon@@ na screw over my neighb@@ ors .
Lee ?
O@@ k .. ok@@ ay .
What is happening to this neighborhood ?
Some van just pulled up ,
That is a school bus , Ren@@ ee . Those are children .
Well , I don &apos;t like the way they &apos;re looking at me .
H@@ ey . I didn &apos;t ask her to move here .
Well ..
maybe it &apos;s time you ask her to leave .
So the whole right side of the clos@@ et is yours ,
Thank you .
No . No , I think us is a mistake .
I wish we had been nic@@ er to Paul .
I wish we had stood by him when he was on trial .
I think about what he must have gone through in prison ,
But I won &apos;t allow him to destroy this street .
It &apos;s not right .
Don &apos;t worry .
We will stop this son of a b@@ itch .
That &apos;s a promise .
H@@ ey . M.@@ J. &apos; s spending the night at a friend &apos;s house ,
So , u@@ h , why are you here ?
He also mentioned all that work that needs to be done
U@@ h , wait . U@@ h , you don &apos;t need to do that .
But if you w@@ anna thank me ,
Mayor Franklin . What an honor . Paul young .
The media will be arriving shortly ,
U@@ h , with the election just a few days away ,
While you &apos;re waiting , would you like a tour of the facility ?
You &apos;re gon@@ na have to leave .
Ok@@ ay . Maybe I mis@@ read some signals .
There have been no signals . I was dating your son .
Ok@@ ay . If that &apos;s the way you feel ,
Ok@@ ay . Ye@@ ah , y@@ e@@ ah , here we are .
Well , here &apos;s trouble .
B@@ unch of ge@@ eks with &quot; vote Franklin &quot; signs just showed up .

She teaches kinder@@ garten .
Ye@@ ah , she &apos;s afraid she &apos;s gon@@ na sc@@ are the kids .
And she can &apos;t teach without feeling her best , right ?
You guys !
Thank you ... so much .
You still want to study ?
She has lost a lot of blood , but she &apos;s stable for now .
We &apos;re gon@@ na take her into surgery and remove the frag@@ ments .
Ok@@ ay . Ok@@ ay , thanks .
Why can &apos;t you tell me right now ?
Because I &apos;m busy res@@ ch@@ ed@@ ul@@ ing sur@@ geri@@ es .

What &apos;s this about a purchasing free@@ ze on the N@@ IC@@ U budget ?
Good . I have two of you here . At least maybe we could ...

We &apos;re buying them medicine .
Right now , we &apos;re low on N@@ IC@@ U blan@@ k@@ ets .
That &apos;s baby blan@@ k@@ ets .
Don &apos;t tell me . Tell the board !
H@@ unt , where did my pro bon@@ o go ?
Well , I took your advice about transfers ...
So I found someone at Seattle Pr@@ es who could do it .
That is my patient .
Not anymore . Your patient is , u@@ h ..
Do you have any idea how difficult it is
There was no way to do the repair without visibility .
M@@ m , no , there was no easy way .
And because you &apos;re car@@ eless and thou@@ ght@@ less ,
You think you can just do whatever you feel like in the moment ,
She was dying !
No , just go . Let me clean up your m@@ ess .
Come on .
And he &apos;s intim@@ id@@ ating B@@ ail@@ ey into not ordering one .
But that &apos;s what he needs .
He made me his family , and then I abandoned him .
It &apos;s just a m@@ ess over there .
S@@ wal@@ low study ?
Ok@@ ay , Ros@@ s , I can &apos;t read this . Take this .
Ros@@ s .
I know .
And I &apos;m not gon@@ na let another one of us die .
You &apos;re an intern .
Don &apos;t talk to me like I don &apos;t know what &apos;s happening .
You &apos;re pre@@ ten@@ ding like it isn &apos;t happening ,
Dr. Grey is here .
She came all this way with a baby ,
And I think you don &apos;t want her to be the one to do that .
I &apos;m offering to take care of this right now .
Just you and me .
A@@ very . I have one more patient for you .
No , no , no . No more .
And I &apos;m calling Car@@ a Mc@@ Adams first thing
A@@ very . A@@ very , look .

You said you transferred her .

You lied ?
Ye@@ ah , I
The money has to come from somewhere .
So , y@@ e@@ ah , I lied , and now you have the money .
I ...
A@@ very . I needed to make a point with you .
I know we &apos;re all doctors , and we &apos;re all busy ,
So you need to do something now .
You are right .
Ye@@ ah . You all need to meet .
I can &apos;t force you to
You &apos;re our b@@ oss , and you can lie .
They &apos;ve all been short runs
You got@@ ta get over this &quot; Special &quot; thing .
Just throw her over your shoulder ,
Every girl &apos;s dream .
She &apos;s the thing that &apos;s special , dum@@ bass .
God , you have the right person right there .
You both want the same thing .
Stop being sc@@ ared .
This family is not sc@@ ared . This boy is not sc@@ ared .
I am not doing this because I want to .
I &apos;m doing this because they asked me to and because I can .
What are you waiting for ?
The arr@@ hyth@@ mi@@ as are coming closer .
If I keep push@@ ing , I &apos;ll send him into v@@ -@@ fi@@ b .
She told us to tell you that she loves you .
Thank you .

The woman &apos;s wearing mis@@ mat@@ ched shoes . Cut her some sl@@ ack .
I have to go check on Richard .
Send me a note next time .
You look like hell .
You know you &apos;re in a building full of beds .
I just need to go lie down .
Ros@@ s , what did you do ?
unless it &apos;s hope or a reason to live .
Oh , you make me lau@@ gh , sad c@@ lown .

Aqu@@ am@@ an ?
Oh , this isn &apos;t a ga@@ g gift , Stu@@ art .
Ye@@ ah , just as well .
ilt &apos;s a pretty rare piece .
I &apos;d rather just sell it to a-@@ real coll@@ ector .
I &apos;m a real coll@@ ector .
How rare is it ?
Oh , I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t even have mentioned it .
It &apos;s probably this st@@ up@@ id diet I &apos;m on .
Why are you on a diet ?
I &apos;ve put on a couple pounds .
H@@ ad to buy these p@@ ants in the men &apos;s section .
Well , we &apos;ve all seen your mo@@ m .
Hi , honey .

You &apos;re kid@@ ding , right ?
I mean , you know
God , I thought we were partners in this marriage .
We are . Stop it .

Re@@ ally ? Tell that to the bathroom scale .
&quot; cause one of you is lying .
Fine , forget I asked .
How was dinner at your mo@@ m &apos;s ?
A@@ w@@ ful .
I had to ru@@ b her o@@ int@@ ment all over her again .
Why can &apos;t she do it ?
H@@ ey , you guys are 3-5 , right ?
Do you know a Cor@@ por@@ al Cou@@ gh@@ lin ?
No , ma &apos;@@ am .
Sorry , but I &apos;ve only been here for a couple months .
Ma &apos;@@ am , if you set one foot in front of the other ,
Man , we are definitely losing the war
I swe@@ ar to God , they b@@ low up another well ,
It &apos;s like fu@@ cking musical chairs .
H@@ ey , do I have to buy a dress for your wedding ?
No . Wh@@ atever you wear in Kab@@ ul is fine .
Ye@@ ah ?
Yes .
The only thing I ask is that you make sure my friend is there .
A@@ w , your friend is me .
I get it .
Mount up !
Jesus , Stern !
I &apos;ll come with you in the car if there &apos;s room .
Oh , great , we &apos;re all going to K@@ and@@ ah@@ ar !

I &apos;m fli@@ pping you the bird in here right now .

If I &apos;m understanding this brief@@ ing ,
Ok@@ ay . Well , I &apos;m covering the girls &apos; school
Ye@@ ah , I can give you something .
This war is like fu@@ cking a gor@@ illa .
You keep going till the gor@@ illa wants to stop .
You know , Afghanistan produces 90 % of the world &apos;s nar@@ co@@ tic op@@ i@@ ates .
So they say .
M@@ mm .
When I worked in the hospital ,
They &apos;d say , &quot; Oh , my son , he broke his arm . &quot;
And we would wonder how the arm got broken to begin with .
What are we talking about , Fa@@ him ?
H@@ mm .
The human body produces its own hero@@ in .
In fact , when the figh@@ t-@@ or-@@ flight inst@@ inc@@ t
That is hero@@ in , co@@ ca@@ ine and amp@@ het@@ am@@ ine , all at once .
Ok@@ ay , great . Are we having the Afgh@@ an version of this conversation ,
Re@@ ally ? Thank you . That &apos;s ..
I ow@@ e you one .
Well , how about a half of one ?
And then we can make it an even three .
Ye@@ ah . Or I could buy you breakfast .
Or a half of one and we can make it an even three .
I think breakfast is of equal monetary value .
My middle name is E@@ o@@ gh@@ an .
Ok@@ ay , I des@@ erve that .
Go@@ d@@ dam@@ n ! Once you got no legs ,
I mean , there &apos;s only so much any of us have any control of ,

So , um ... see you soon .
Oh , I can &apos;t wait . Ye@@ ah , y@@ e@@ ah .
Al@@ right , see you ton@@ ight .
Ok@@ ay . Ok@@ ay .
See you ton@@ ight .
And are you ready to know ?
I can reach for my own water .
The hospital just wants me to rest a few more weeks .
There &apos;s nothing wrong with me helping you with that .
My@@ r@@ na : Is everybody dec@@ ent ?
Exc@@ ept for the ball ga@@ g and jo@@ ck stra@@ p , we &apos;re good .

Which , I &apos;ve learned , does not include
I &apos;m afraid not , Saul , no .
I &apos;ll come back to check on you later .
Thank you .
I will never take it for granted again .
You know , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s an accident ,
He saw you , who you are , all of you .
I think there &apos;s a part of him that wanted you to come here
that you &apos;d have the freedom
How does it feel when it &apos;s quiet and cold ?
I shall not want .
He mak@@ eth me to lie down in green past@@ ures .
What
He and Mag@@ gie are argu@@ ing .
They can &apos;t stand each other .
They &apos;ve been trying to be civil for our sake ,
But you haven &apos;t been around enough to notice , have you ?
Well , that would be hard
It &apos;s not your fault .
U@@ h , I don &apos;t think any of us should have been here ton@@ ight .
Ye@@ ah .
U@@ h , V@@ ic , wait . I , um ...
I clearly still have some differences with Jackson ,
I-@@ I won &apos;t do it again .
You know what , I set you up on a date without telling you ,

B@@ ye . B@@ ye .
When the body reveals its secrets ,
The good news is , when the truth is out ..
Lev@@ i ? When did you get home ?
I didn &apos;t hear you come in .
He &apos;s gone .
Un@@ cle Saul is gone .
And the time has come ..
No , but I am Super Gay .
You can &apos;t begin to imagine how l feel .
The only person who could is the woman
If signing can spare her this pain ..
then I will do it .
I love it !
Ok@@ ay , I-@@ I don &apos;t love it . It &apos;s just so ...

I &apos;m thinking we should hang .

Look , one woman at a bar is just sad .
But two , and it &apos;s girls &apos; night out .
So what do you say ?

That &apos;s a lovely offer , but I think I &apos;m gon@@ na pass .
Oh , come on .
We got@@ ta get back in the game ,
That hair does come down , doesn &apos;t it ?
Re@@ ally . Ren@@ ee , that is just not how I like to meet men .
Inside , over there .

The only reason I didn &apos;t smoke back then
So ... what do you say ?
Care to join me out back behind the garage
And I am so lucky .
I couldn &apos;t feel happ@@ ier than I do right now .
I mean just so happy it &apos;s working .
Ye@@ ah .
What do you think ? Does this say
No . I think it says &quot; Credit card dec@@ lined . &quot;
Ye@@ ah , but things are starting to turn around l@@ ately .
I &apos;ve been selling a lot of my jewelry .
Get out !
Out there and keep selling .
Oh , h@@ ello , sil@@ k !
Stand@@ ing there in the m@@ all , it just hit me .
I can &apos;t spend the rest of my life
Not knowing where she is ,
I have to find her .
Well , there &apos;s a private det@@ ective I work with .
But San@@ che@@ z is a pretty common name .
If &apos;s not surprising the hospital couldn &apos;t find &apos; em .
But I know something the hospital doesn &apos;t .
When I was in labor ,
She lived in El Pas@@ o , and she was so excited to have
That &apos;s gon@@ na help .
So you think you can find her ?
We &apos;ll do our best .
Carlos is on board with this , right ?
Absol@@ utely .
H@@ ey . I just came by to pick up my en@@ vel@@ ope for the week .
Ok@@ ay . Inside .
And don &apos;t listen to this conversation .
It &apos;s about your Christmas gift .
I &apos;m buying all my girls ste@@ aks . You got a pre@@ ference ?
This is a cock@@ tail car@@ dig@@ an .
Look closely . The buttons are sh@@ iny .
Where &apos;s your clos@@ et ?
I have never seen so many swe@@ ater sets .
Are you sure this is a clos@@ et and not a portal to the 1950s ?
There is nothing wrong with my clothing .
Oh , I won &apos;t need a ride . I &apos;m going home with K@@ eit@@ h .
Oh , I don &apos;t think so . He just left .
Oh , he &apos;s pul@@ ling the car around .
Now you think I should play

Ok@@ ay , before you do anything ha@@ sty ,
Oh . I &apos;ll be careful when I un@@ wra@@ p him .
Ren@@ ee , wait . Please don &apos;t go home with K@@ eit@@ h .
Why ?
Oh , he &apos;s the one you like , isn &apos;t he ?
You don &apos;t want to come off like a s@@ lu@@ t .
A@@ w , gee , then chip won &apos;t ask me to the pro@@ m .
Ren@@ ee , wait ! What about me ?
Oh , it &apos;s getting late .
Stay in the di@@ m light and don &apos;t play hard to get .
K@@ eit@@ h , hi . It &apos;s B@@ ree .

Ok@@ ay , fine . They think he &apos;s a mur@@ derer .
But he was ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated .
Fel@@ ic@@ ia T@@ ill@@ man framed him .
Ye@@ ah , for that crime .
What do you mean ?
Before Fel@@ ic@@ ia showed up around here .
her sister Mar@@ tha was mur@@ dered . And , all due respect ,
Does everybody think that ?
Fel@@ ic@@ ia may be a few fingers short of a high five ,
Well , that &apos;s enough du@@ sting for today , boys .
I gu@@ ess all that &apos;s left is a little vac@@ u@@ um@@ ing .
O@@ oh ! Y@@ ay ! Get the vacuum .

Wo@@ w . And I thought your acting was bad on the web site .
Fine . I am sorry , ok@@ ay ?

I fre@@ aked out when I didn &apos;t get that bonus check .
See , my family &apos;s in Virginia ,
Ye@@ ah , well , I know what that &apos;s like .
And even with that extra money .
I always feel like I &apos;m living week to week .
Fl@@ at screen TV , clos@@ et full of new clothes .
I know . Prob@@ ably sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have bought all that .
But you know how it is .
Every once in a while , you want a little spl@@ urge .

Can you tell me what happened ?
There was this strange man .
I made him a pe@@ an@@ ut butter sand@@ wich .
I thought he was Bil@@ ly .
And once the kids went to sleep ,
A long ... bath .
And afterwards , I &apos;d just sit there
do her routine , see .
Ru@@ b her lo@@ tion on , com@@ b her hair .
Thanks . I painted it myself .
This is my partner , J@@ ay P@@ rit@@ ch@@ ett .
I represent J@@ et@@ ate@@ ch . Are you familiar with us ?
Not in the least .
Oh , you &apos;ll have to for@@ give J@@ ay .
Any@@ way , our building is two doors down ,
We want this lot ,
That &apos;s a nice offer , J@@ are ,
It &apos;s not about the huge profits .
We &apos;re building my son@@ -in-@@ law &apos;s dream ,
Oh , I know all about dreams .
Some@@ day , I hope to get into encryp@@ ted pack@@ et switching .
Good luck to you , gentlemen .
J@@ ay , this man &apos;s vision just got bl@@ ur@@ ry with t@@ ears .
Would you get ah@@ old of yourself .
I just said that cra@@ p to drive the price up .
He &apos;ll be back .
I don &apos;t want him to come back .
Whether you meant it or not , this is my dream .
We &apos;re in this to make money .
And we will .
By the power v@@ ested in me by the commercial z@@ oning board ,
That &apos;s a good omen .
I &apos;m gon@@ na po@@ go it .
Any@@ body else bring a sho@@ vel ?
Oh , thank god you &apos;re here . It &apos;s a night@@ m@@ are .
The staff is in an u@@ pro@@ ar about these budget cuts .
T@@ elling them there &apos;s no more over@@ time was bad ,
I don &apos;t know what else to do .
Sal@@ es-@@ wise we didn &apos;t exactly have
What do people give each other , anyway ?
Sh@@ ut up ! You are not a puzzle sol@@ ver , you never have been .
You &apos;re a drama queen !
Now there is a man in there about to die .
The game is on , solve it !
He is the Napoleon of black@@ mail .
No chance for you to be a hero this time , Mr Hol@@ mes .
The alternative , however , would require your approval .
To the very best of times , John .
Did you miss me ?
How is this possible ?
How is the ex@@ ile going ?
I &apos;ve only been gone four minutes .
Well , I certainly hope you@@ ve lear@@ nt your lesson .
Who needs me this time ?
Miss me ?
Mrs Hu@@ dson , there is a woman in my sitting room !
Is it inten@@ tional ?
She &apos;s a client .
Sa@@ id you were out , insi@@ sted on waiting .
Would you , er , care to sit down ?
Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t you ask her what she wanted ?
You ask her !
Why didn &apos;t you ask her ?
For God &apos;s sake , give her some lines ,
Good afternoon . I am Sher@@ lock Hol@@ mes ,
You may speak freely in front of him ,
Hol@@ mes !
However , before you do ,
You have recently married a man
You have come to this agency as a last resort ,
Good Lord , Hol@@ mes !
All of this is , of course , perfectly evident from your perf@@ ume .
Her perf@@ ume ?
Yes , her perf@@ ume , which brings insight to me and disaster to you .
How so ?
We are ready to begin .
Beg@@ in what ?
Sometimes to solve a case , one must first solve another .
Oh , you have a case , then , a new one ?
An old one , very old .
I shall have to go deep .
Deep ? In@@ to what ?
My@@ self .
You , you &apos;re dead , you can &apos;t be here , you died !
Am I not beautiful , Thomas ?
As beautiful as the day you married me ?
Who ..
What the hell is all this about ? !
What does it look like , my hand@@ some friend ?
You may leave any time you like .
Dr Ho@@ oper , I asked Mr Hol@@ mes to come here . Co@@ operate .
That &apos;s an order .
There are two &quot; Features of interest , &quot;
I never say that .
You do , actually , quite a lot .
First of all , this is definitely E@@ mel@@ ia Ric@@ ol@@ etti .
She has been c@@ ategor@@ ically identified .
Beyond a doubt , it is her .
Then who was that in Lim@@ ehouse last night ?
That was also E@@ mel@@ ia Ric@@ ol@@ etti .
It can &apos;t have been . She was dead , she was here .
She was posi@@ tively identified
He had no reason to lie , could hardly have been mist@@ aken .
H@@ mm , maybe it was a secret twin .
A what ? !
A secret twin .
H@@ mm ? You know ?
A twin that nobody knows about .
This whole thing could have been planned .
Since the moment of conception .
How breath@@ tak@@ ingly pres@@ cient of her .
It is never tw@@ ins , Wat@@ son !
Then what &apos;s your theory ?
More to the point , what &apos;s your problem ?
I , I don &apos;t understand ...
Oh , isn &apos;t he observ@@ ant , now that D@@ ad@@ dy &apos;s gone
Re@@ ally ?
Yes , really .
Ama@@ zin@@ q .... what one has to do to get ahead in a man &apos;s world .
What &apos;s he saying that for ?
Get back to work !
Well , Hol@@ mes ? Sur@@ ely you must have some theory ?
Not yet .
These are deep waters , Wat@@ son , deep waters .
And I shall have to go deeper still .
It was not for several months that we were to pick up
And then under very unexpected circumstances .
Five of them now , all the same , every one of them .
H@@ ush , please , this is a matter of supre@@ me importance .
What is ?
How do you know that ?
I can tell .
I &apos;m not a k@@ id anymore .
I know when you &apos;re hi@@ ding stuff .
Well .
You &apos;re growing up so fast .
Oh , honey , a part of me still sees you
But every day you &apos;re getting stronger and sm@@ ar@@ ter .
I had a pair that mat@@ ched .
People would always look at us .
Because you were a grown woman in pink stri@@ ped over@@ alls .
They probably thought we were a ch@@ ris@@ tian singing group .
They &apos;d say we looked sweet together .
I wouldn &apos;t trade that memory for anything .
I know this is hard .
This is really happening to me .
Love b@@ ites , doesn &apos;t it ?
What did , u@@ h , fran@@ k do ?
He was really sweet .
Hand@@ ed me a box of kle@@ en@@ ex , said all the right things .
But trust me , i &apos;m never seeing him again .
Well , think of it this way .
It cost you one guy to face the truth .
Your marriage is over .
Now you can move on just like tom .
Y@@ ip@@ pe@@ e for me .
M@@ m-@@ H@@ mm .
The only way to live life is wil@@ dly .
What ?
You took b@@ ree out drinking ?
Ye@@ ah . Why ? Is that bad ?
How the hell could ren@@ ee take her out drinking ? !
Do@@ esn &apos;t she know b@@ ree &apos;s an alco@@ ho@@ lic ?
I have known ren@@ ee a long time ,
Well .. at least this helps explain The way b@@ ree &apos;s been acting l@@ ately .
I don &apos;t know . There &apos;s not enough boo@@ ze in the world
How could we not know this ?
An intervention ? You &apos;ve got@@ ta be kid@@ ding me .
We &apos;re your friends . We w@@ anna help .
Get out ! All of you !
A@@ of JO@@ U .
I@@ di@@ ot .
Talk to US , swe@@ e@@ tie . Why are you be@@ having like this ?
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
It &apos;s not like we can &apos;t see what &apos;s going on .
And what about all these men ? We know about that , too .
Wo@@ w , can &apos;t hide anything from you girls , hu@@ h ?
And did you also know i tried to kill myself ?
What ?
Oh , my god .
How &apos;d that little nu@@ g@@ get of information
If this is a jo@@ ke , it &apos;s not funny .
It &apos;s not a jo@@ ke .
I checked into a mot@@ el room
With the jo@@ cks at Sou@@ thwest ?
Or the &quot; in crowd &quot; at the Virgin Terminal ?
You know who &apos;s going to be a terminal vir@@ gin ?
You can make all the death threats you want ,
The fact that you two work at the airport .

Rob@@ b@@ ins .
These aren &apos;t people who hear the word no .
If they want surgery for their son ,
You &apos;ve been with this boy since day one .
I believe you can do this successfully .
Don &apos;t walk away now
The surgery is a bad idea , chief
In your hands ... is it impossible ?
Ok@@ ay ?
Ok@@ ay , I &apos;ll do it . I &apos;ll try .
Oh , you don &apos;t even want to know .
I had perfect grades , perfect record ,
My parents couldn &apos;t do a thing about it .
Want to hear about my childhood ?
No ? ok@@ ay .
I &apos;ll just , u@@ h , think about it qui@@ et@@ ly in my own head .
All right , n@@ ails in , everything &apos;s tight .
Let &apos;s take a look .
Fant@@ astic .
En@@ d-@@ ti@@ dal c-@@ 0-@@ 2 just dropped from 34 to 22 .
Oh , come on@@ . give me a break here , Hill@@ ary .
She has a new mur@@ m@@ ur .
The patient was cr@@ ash@@ ing .
She was not cr@@ ash@@ ing .
It was a procedure I &apos;ve done before .
I handled it , and she &apos;s fine .
Ye@@ ah , but what if she wasn &apos;t ?
No , he &apos;s not gon@@ na fire me
Only he was giving me words of encour@@ agement ,
For the record , you rock that in there .
H@@ unt &apos;s just je@@ al@@ ous he didn &apos;t do it himself .
Sh@@ ut up .

Tell me I &apos;m great .

What the hell happened to the Anderson boy ?
He &apos;s inf@@ ective shock .
His body was too un@@ stable to handle the surgery ,
You know , I can help .
No ! no , you can &apos;t .
because as long as you &apos;re standing
So how about it , Phi@@ l ?
You gon@@ na stop this train ? &apos; cause these bra@@ kes are out .
Oh . And I suggest you lose this number .
Mit@@ ch@@ ell ? !
Ye@@ ah , I was pretty ti@@ cked off
And then he stopped taking my calls ,
&quot; U su@@ ck . &quot;
Is you didn &apos;t believe in me , and you believe in everything !
You know , I knew that swe@@ ater wasn &apos;t st@@ olen .
And here I pick blue yar@@ n to match your eyes ,
Although you look amazing in black . Dam@@ n you .
Come on .
.. &quot; Le@@ aving 17 dead and thousands without power . &quot;
It &apos;s bad that the baby li@@ stens to such terrible things .
He &apos;s heard worse .
Hello you .
Well you can stand then .
I kind of ow@@ e you an ap@@ ology .
For not telling me your name
So is this real ?
Ye@@ ah , it was used in human sacrific@@ es .
I gu@@ ess one too many .
Can I buy you a drink ?
Ye@@ ah sure .
This is where I come all the time .
I like to sit and people watch .
Oh right here .
This is nice .
So what can this piece of ass get you ?
Oh sh@@ it , you heard that ?
Ye@@ ah , you . Come on . Get ou@@ tt@@ a here .
Tell your mother I &apos;ll call her later .
I don &apos;t know . It &apos;s been a@@ while .
Why don &apos;t you make a date with Marina ?
No ? Why no ? Look out there , man .
I don &apos;t care about that .
You won &apos;t help me because you &apos;re
I pick up your gro@@ c@@ eries , I help you with your laundry , your .
I do your hair . I come here every day .
I clean up your sh@@ it !
The dogs have got it right .
Nothing you could ve done
The blood supply to her brain was cut off
So even though Dr. Sh@@ ep@@ herd was able to fix
She &apos;s brain dead . I get it .
She &apos;s only 16 .
That &apos;s good news .
She &apos;ll be an excellent candidate for organ donation .
Excellent candidate . Excellent organs . Young .
Du@@ de ..
You were rob@@ bed . You got scre@@ wed by politics .
The chief , he needed a scap@@ eg@@ o@@ at . It &apos;s so un@@ fair .
I &apos;m sorry .
I can &apos;t do this .
How should I know ? I thought she was here .
She &apos;s avo@@ iding me . She won &apos;t answer my pages .
So what do you want me to do about it ?
Well , you guys are together now , right ?
So why don &apos;t you talk to her and find out
You &apos;re just p@@ is@@ sed she &apos;s not here
She won &apos;t talk to me .
It &apos;s just George .
Your friends , though ,
Wh@@ -@@ What is that anyway ?
It &apos;s how we learn , by doing .
And I lost my shot at the solo surgery
Any@@ way , there &apos;ll always be sur@@ geri@@ es .
There won &apos;t always be fi@@ anc@@ ee who &apos;s come back from their dead
I mean , the only time they ever bo@@ ther with us
That &apos;s not true .
Dr. Slo@@ an took the time to teach me today ,
he likes you
Oh , don &apos;t tell me you haven &apos;t noticed his eyes on your ass .
You are del@@ u@@ sion@@ al .
Is he cutting into her thro@@ at ?
B@@ loo@@ dy hell .
So I supp@@ ose you &apos;ll use a strip test
That can damage the en@@ do@@ th@@ el@@ ium
I can leave .
Dr. Slo@@ an , I w
I was just trying to learn
I mean , these residents are running around
I &apos;m very sorry for your loss but tests confirm
She has no thoughts , no emotions , no senses .
I &apos;m Dr. Di@@ x@@ on .
I will be har@@ vest@@ ing your sister &apos;s organs
Please , she &apos;s our baby . We need more time .
I &apos;m very sorry for your loss ,
They could save many lives .
W@@ ake up , hol@@ ly
I &apos;m very sorry for your loss but your sister can &apos;t wake up .
Her basic functions are gone . Her brain is dead .
I knew what I was doing , so if you want to pun@@ ish someone
You know who your father is
So if I were you ,
Yes , si@@ r . Thank you , si@@ r .
There are people dying .
Right now , there are people dying .
It &apos;s in@@ appropriate .
You made it personal .
N@@ one of you said anything .
Those were all our intern@@ s .
But I won this .
They picked me .
If I don &apos;t des@@ erve this solo surgery .
Then none of us do .
I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m more je@@ al@@ ous of Alex
I think there &apos;s something wrong with her . M@@ er .
There &apos;s something wrong with all of us . George
Not here .
Here
Ye@@ ah . I need you to sc@@ ru@@ b in with me .
I &apos;m fre@@ aking out . I &apos;m fre@@ aking out
I told her I love her before a solo surgery .
I can &apos;t believe that . Who does that ?
And now she &apos;s not gon@@ na show up and I &apos;m fre@@ aking out
If you screw this up and kill this guy
This was my chance to earn it back
But first , a silent prayer for our fallen captain mar@@ cus .
Go@@ d@@ speed , old friend .
This is bor@@ ing . Is he dead ?
No , he &apos;s not dead . He &apos;s just sleeping .
Bab@@ ies need to sleep a lot
H@@ ey , Mrs. D. H@@ ey , Lu@@ cy .
Every time .
Well , that &apos;s a nice shirt .
Thanks . I designed it myself .
It &apos;s my best seller .
I &apos;m so je@@ al@@ ous you know what you want to do with your life .
I wish I was inspired like you .
Or , you know , aim higher .
Open yourself up to some new experiences
Oh , my g
Fine . Just ..

Good , you wo@@ ke him up .
I decided to go gentle with Phi@@ l ,
And with the new baby ,
But come on . He &apos;s been alive a month .
How hard is it to support your own head ?
What the hell ?
Hello , boys .
What a sweet ride , Pep@@ per .
What are you guys doing here ?
I &apos;ve been gol@@ fing for a few weeks .
Pep@@ per &apos;s been teaching me .
I grew up gol@@ fing with my father ,
Or as he was known around the clu@@ b@@ house ,
Well , we should play together as a four@@ some .
Did you see that ? !
Ye@@ ah , that wasn &apos;t half bad .
H@@ ey , listen , I &apos;m sorry I y@@ elled .
No , no , no . That &apos;s what I needed .
My old tum@@ bling master in college used to y@@ ell at me all the time .
It just made me better .
Re@@ ally ?
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah .
He &apos;d say terrible things about my man@@ hood ,
So bring it , J@@ ay !
You st@@ ink , Phi@@ l .
You &apos;re the worst thing to happen to golf
Did you hear that ?
And he wasn &apos;t just talking to Phi@@ l .
He was talking to 10-@@ year-old you
Su@@ ck it , N@@ ancy !
I was just trying to help .
Just listen with an open mind .
She doesn &apos;t believe in psych@@ ics .
It &apos;s not just psych@@ ics .
I &apos;m going to save you some time .
She doesn &apos;t have a boy@@ friend .
Maybe not now , but soon .
You see ?
That means
You are going to meet someone special .
I see a hand@@ some man on a horse ,
Well , I am going to a ren@@ aissance fair this weekend .
Yes , I know .
There &apos;s no ren@@ aissance fair .
Even if there was , I wouldn &apos;t go .
I gu@@ ess some people just aren &apos;t comfortable taking center stage .
Ok@@ ay . Well , maybe we can pump Marcus
He &apos;s too sick .
But don &apos;t worry , C@@ am , you &apos;ll think of something .
It &apos;s always dark@@ est right before the ..
Reu@@ ben , could you keep that thing still ? !
Ok@@ ay , well , I gu@@ ess we only have one option .
Un@@ bear@@ able .
I &apos;ll play it on the way back . I have it on my iPod phone .
And the cat &apos;s in the cra@@ dle
I don &apos;t know when ,
I never made the time .
Luke !
I need to call my son .
What time is it in Dam@@ as@@ cus ?
Why don &apos;t I just draw them a map ?
Re@@ ady to play , Phi@@ l ?
I can &apos;t , Carl ! My boy &apos;s sets are in a play !
I get the feeling that something wonderful
Yes , it &apos;s Mann@@ y .
He got the lead role in the school play .
Yes , that &apos;s it .
Ok@@ ay , I think you might have met her hal@@ f@@ way on that one .
Do you feel that ?
A presence has just entered the room .
Or the A.@@ C. k@@ ick@@ ed in .
Gl@@ oria , I have to say something .
Come on , m@@ ama . Let &apos;s get you un@@ packed .
Oh , yes , let &apos;s do , &apos; cause I brought you a present@@ . let &apos;s go . Come on .

Not just any recipes .
Some of these have been in my family since before the war of northern aggres@@ sion .
I mean what I mean .
Um , well ...
I gu@@ ess mi@@ ke didn &apos;t tell you that i &apos;m , u@@ h , really not a cook .
Oh , no , he told me .
That &apos;s why I gave you these recipes , and I &apos;m gon &apos; teach you how to make &apos; em , too .
Is@@ n &apos;t that nice , honey ?
So should I s@@ ne@@ ak out the back ?
Oh , no . That &apos;s my land@@ lady . She &apos;s cool .
She knows you &apos;re dealing ?
Well , she &apos;s not that cool .
oh , h@@ ey , guys !
I wish I could say the same for your real estate agent .
Well , what do you mean ?
What is this ?
You left it in the printer .
It &apos;s a house listing .
Ye@@ ah , for a house in bal@@ tim@@ ore .
It &apos;s all an act , swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ t . You don &apos;t see it now , but you will .
He &apos;s only back because he wants something .
I don &apos;t know what exactly .
I just know we &apos;re not safe here .
Oh , sure . That &apos;s it . D has some evil plan .
It couldn &apos;t be that he wants to be in my life , that he loves me .
He isn &apos;t capable of love , d@@ yl@@ an .
I found that out the hard way ,
Mo@@ ve if you want .
I &apos;m staying here with my father .
But what happened ? Things were going fine .
I was thinking I &apos;d take him for a few hours .
It &apos;s not really a good time .
Well , b@@ ree , whenever I call , it &apos;s not a good time ,
Well , that sounds bor@@ ing . I know .
you give her a dental exam with your tongue ?
B@@ ree , you don &apos;t understand .
I don &apos;t think so .
I &apos;d hate for him to be around en you had another attack of del@@ ayed mor@@ ality ,
I am not having this argument .
He is my son , too .
Not exactly .
elli@@ e , your door is locked ! El@@ lie !
oh , shut up already .
M@@ om , gu@@ ess what ? D@@ ad &apos;s coming to my senior rec@@ ital next week .
I could swing by and pick you up , if you want .
We could make it a real family ou@@ ting .
D@@ yl@@ an , your father and i need to talk .. in private .
I &apos;m not done saying goo@@ d-@@ b@@ ye .
Yes , you are .
Please get rid of that g@@ um .
Me@@ aning what ? You still love me ?
I do .
And I know I &apos;m somewhat to bl@@ ame for what &apos;s happened between us .
At &apos;s why I &apos;ve for@@ given you for kid@@ n@@ apping our daughter .
The least you can do is meet me hal@@ f@@ way .
Wa@@ yne
Maybe not , but I &apos;m gon@@ na give it to you anyway &apos; cause ...
I still think we could be happy together .
C@@ ould we ?
&quot; S@@ elling drugs brings in more money than waiting tables . &quot;
Ok@@ ay , look , maybe I was wrong . Maybe it was fl@@ our . Maybe she &apos;s a pa@@ stry chef .
Ye@@ ah ! And she came up with that tat@@ too cover story to hide her il@@ lic@@ it b@@ aking .
All right , look , I know we have to do something , but this woman &apos;s our friend .
Yes , and I &apos;m a convic@@ ted fel@@ on still on prob@@ ation .
Are you involved with either one of them ?
Um , Dou@@ g &apos;s g@@ ay .
And Mal@@ col@@ m , I did have a thing but it &apos;s over .
He got me in with Open Space though ,
Yes . I heard .
Oh , thank you , y@@ e@@ ah , I &apos;m done .
It would &apos;ve been a@@ wesome if you saw No Ex@@ it .
D@@ ad@@ dy said you were really good .
I was al@@ right .
It wasn &apos;t my best nicht but at least he could get ,
Figure out why he &apos;s doing ,
What do you mean ?
Um , it &apos;s just really nice of him to help out .
No , I &apos;m fine . Just go get a drink or something , ok@@ ay ?
It &apos;s gon@@ na be delicious .
Oh I hope so .
It will be . Can &apos;t wait .
Nice to meet you . Hi , how are you ?
It &apos;s a very big decision , we &apos;re excited .
of friends who &apos;ve been trying for years .
And they just had their first child .
So we &apos;ll see .
It &apos;s really nice to meet you .
Well , Ye@@ ah .
I think I des@@ erve a class of wine after all that , don &apos;t you ?
Want one ?
Yes , thank you . Does everyone have a glass ?
Yes we do .
Let &apos;s have a to@@ ast , to Christmas .
Mer@@ ry Christmas ! Mer@@ ry Christmas ! Mer@@ ry Christmas !
Now , I don &apos;t see anything ab@@ normal in your MR@@ I ,
Thank God .
And your blood work came back completely clear .
But what wor@@ ries me are the memory tests that I sent you for .
You have spor@@ adi@@ c memory im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment ,
And there is evidence of decline in your level of mental function .
So I think we should do a PE@@ T Scan .
I know what a PE@@ T Scan is .
What , in particular , would you be looking for ?
I want to see if the results are consistent with Alz@@ heimer &apos;s Dis@@ ease .
It would be rare for someone as young as yourself
Now last time I asked you to bring in a close relative .
I really didn &apos;t think that would be necessary .
Ok@@ ay . But next time , for sure . Ok@@ ay ?
Oh God , back to square one .
Are we both here on the 17th ?
I don &apos;t remember .
Un@@ -@@ hu@@ h , Phi@@ l and Di@@ ane were saying , they might come to town for the weekend .
How long are you going to , um , keep at that thing ?
T@@ ill it &apos;s clean .
John swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ t , wake up .
What time is it ?
I need to talk to you .
I &apos;ve um , I &apos;ve got something wrong with me .
What are you talking about ?
I &apos;ve been seeing a neuro@@ log@@ ist .
You &apos;ve been seeing a neuro@@ log@@ ist , why ?
I assume that if I have the gene ,
I &apos;m afraid so .
And if they are carriers , what ,
I &apos;m afraid is 100 % o .
The kids will all be here for our anniversary .
I don &apos;t think we should tell them .
Not until we have the test results .
But we will by then , if I go in next week .
I w@@ anna know as soon as possible .
What the hell is the Go@@ d@@ dam@@ n elevator ?
I mean here we are in a major hospital , and they only have one elevator running ?
John it &apos;s ok@@ ay
We could &apos;ve taken the stairs by now
Well , um , everybody .
What &apos;s going on ?
Oh boy .
Are you guys gon@@ na break up or ?
No , no , it &apos;s nothing like that .
M@@ om , are you sick ?
Tom turned out negative and Ly@@ dia didn &apos;t want to know
Baby how are you feeling ?
I &apos;m ok@@ ay .
One good thing , at least I found out before the next I@@ U@@ I session
They can be sure the bab@@ ies will be ok@@ ay .
Anna where are you ? I &apos;m on my way to a lecture
I &apos;ll have a regular with blu@@ e@@ berries and co@@ con@@ ut please .
Alice , where the hell were you ?
Um , I went for a run .
You &apos;ve been gone for two hours , I was wor@@ ried about you .
Well , then I went to P@@ ink@@ berry .
Ye@@ ah .
Well I hope you enjoyed that
Sus@@ an Kir@@ by and her husband .
I &apos;m sorry I forgot . I have Alz@@ heimer &apos;s .
I tex@@ ted you , I em@@ ailed you . There are ways to -
I had absolutely no idea where you were ,
I told you , I can &apos;t when I &apos;m running
Yes !
I hate that this is happening to me .
I hate it too .
I know , I know John .
I am ,
I might not be able to remember names or answer simple questions ,
I think you &apos;re doing great recently .
Rel@@ ative to what ?
I wish I had cancer .
Don &apos;t say that .
No , I do . I mean it . I mean ,
People have cancer and they wear pink ri@@ bb@@ ons for you
In 2013 , we completed exterior re@@ pairs ,
Oh that &apos;s good .
We also took away a lot of the old security doors .
Res@@ idents are issued a b@@ racelet instead which keeps them from using elev@@ ators
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve experienced this yet with your parents
I see
even dist@@ res@@ sed by the confusion they experienced from all the stim@@ ulation .
So we re@@ defined activities to include
Staff looks for opportunities to many meaning@@ ful connections with residents .
Starting with knowing about the person
One woman who had worked as a nur@@ se sat part of most days
That &apos;s hear@@ t@@ breaking
We don &apos;t have any restrictions on visiting times .
Famili@@ es and friends are welcome any hour , day or night .
It doesn &apos;t look anyone is here today .
Well , Sunday is the day they usually come by .
What &apos;s that ?
That &apos;s a chair alarm ,
Is she al@@ right ?
It &apos;s just a prec@@ au@@ tionary measure .
It &apos;s all women .
We do have mainly female residents here , but there are men .
There is William over there .
They &apos;re just not powerful enough to put me to sleep .
Do you want to try Lun@@ est@@ a ?
What about Roh@@ yp@@ no@@ l ?
That &apos;s very strong
Hi Alice , I am you and um , I have something very important to say to you .
And don &apos;t tell anyone what you &apos;re doing
Oh I love it here .
Me too .
Can you believe that that was 30 years ?
Don &apos;t do that to me . Oh my God .
Oh that was a complicated time , hu@@ h ?
You were dealing with a lot , what was it ? About a year after ?
Ye@@ ah , something like that .
I know I said this before
Me too . We had a great time though .
Ye@@ ah .
Don &apos;t you wish we had more of them ?
If you mean b@@ low jobs on the beach ,
But , y@@ e@@ ah , you know , all of it .
Well you were rel@@ ent@@ less . You wanted everything . And all at once .
So I am , that &apos;s how I like it .
Anna &apos;s the same way right ?
I like you the way you are ,
Thank God you do .
This is so great you know ,
And we &apos;re gon@@ na do what ? Drive around the country in an R@@ V ?
I don &apos;t know . You can spend more time here . Go to But@@ an .
Well , I think our summer on the island is all the excit@@ ement I can handle .
Ok@@ ay , well you know what ?
H@@ ey when are you going to the conference ?
Monday .
And when is U@@ y@@ dia coming
Are we going running ?
Yes , yes we are . I just have to go pe@@ e , I &apos;ll be right back
You work all the time .
What I liked about it was how ... how big ,
Ye@@ ah , the scope of it
It &apos;s un@@ belie@@ vable to me that you guys had lived through that .
You must &apos;ve known , you must &apos;ve known som@@ ebo@@ dy that died from AIDS , right ?
Ye@@ ah , everybody did .
We lost a lot of people .
But you think ,
You did the scenes in your acting class .
Ye@@ ah . How did you know that ?
I don &apos;t know , you must &apos;ve told me .
We must live , we must live .
There will come a time we all know ,
why , for what purpose they are all suffering ,
Now we must live ,
Tom@@ orrow I will go off on my own , and I will teach ,
It &apos;s autumn now , soon it will be winter ,
H@@ ey , you were amazing .
Yes , so good .
Often they &apos;ve managed to su@@ stain
Cle@@ arly Alice &apos;s memory is falling , but she &apos;s still incredibly res@@ our@@ ce@@ ful .
Thank you .
II know you are dis@@ cour@@ aged .
But sometimes I see patients &quot; Plat@@ o &quot; even at this point ,
Alice .
Will you be there ?
Yes , I &apos;m looking forward to it .
I &apos;m going to be away on business in Minnesota , so I wor@@ ried .
Are you sure this is a good idea ? Consi@@ dering the state she &apos;s in ,
I think it would be great for her .
Ye@@ ah , and I &apos;m sure it &apos;s about it , but .
But what ?
Have you thought about making it more personal ?
I don &apos;t understand what you mean by &quot; personal . &quot;
You know , you &apos;re not speaking to a room of scientists ,
You weren &apos;t listening because that &apos;s all there . That &apos;s in the speech .
O@@ k , don &apos;t ask me then .
Dun@@ no , then I won &apos;t ask , then .
H@@ ey , mo@@ m , just give it one more shot , ok ?
I can &apos;t because I have done it already .
I use this yellow ... ... yellow th@@ ing@@ y to mark it
G@@ ot it , totally , just practice more .
Do you know it takes me three days to write this ?
You can turn to it one more .
No , it took me three days .
Sorry .
Three days .
I think I &apos;ll try to forget that just happened .
All my life , I have accum@@ ulated memories ,
The night I met my husband ,
As you can imagine , or as you know ,
Who can take us seriously when we are so far from who we once were ?
And like any disease ,
I know I &apos;m alive .
I have people I loved de@@ arly ,
I rail against myself for not being able to remember things ,
And please , do not think I am suffering ,
Stru@@ g@@ gling to be part of things , to stay connected to who I once was .
So living the moment , I tell myself .
It &apos;s really all I can do ,
and not beat myself up too much for master@@ ing the art of losing
It will go , I know it will . It may be gone by tomorrow ,
Thank you for this opportunity ,
It &apos;s the May@@ o Clin@@ ic , start up next spring ,
So you want us to move to
Everything I know is here ,
Are they coming ?
It &apos;s just a two-@@ hour flight , we &apos;d see them as often as we do now .
I look forward to see you .
H@@ ey m@@ ama . It &apos;s Anna , mo@@ m .
I thought you were my sister .
It &apos;s ok
Thank you so much for this .
How are you feeling ?
J@@ E@@ ow are you feeling ?
G@@ id@@ dy Up .
Mr. Student Council President ,
One second .
Why would you call me that ?
Luke somehow beat me in the election for president ,
Not to be hyper@@ bo@@ lic , but humans are a decade away
You &apos;re trying to tell me
You are dres@@ sed like a character
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about , ok@@ ay ?
Rainer &apos;s taking me to Cab@@ o for the weekend .
So , I had a problem .
I wasn &apos;t sure if my hairdryer
Oh , and telling my dad .
I had two problems .
When Mann@@ y was 5 , he went to a pet@@ ting zo@@ o
By the time they pulled the pig@@ s off him ,
Joe , relax .
Ani@@ mals don &apos;t attack people for no reason .
Let go of me ! Oh , let go of me !
Run , Jer@@ ry ! They do terrible things !
Good news .
The box of hair products we pre-@@ shipped has arrived
I don &apos;t care about our hair anymore .
H@@ ey ! That &apos;s crazy talk .
I still haven &apos;t gotten up the g@@ uts to tell my parents .
My mo@@ m will be cool , but my dad is gon@@ na fre@@ ak out .
Well , I &apos;ll tell him .
Your dad and I are bu@@ ds .
And I am excellent at deliver@@ ing bad news with a smile .
And that means the Coast Guard
I &apos;m sure we &apos;ll be fine .
Sm@@ ell those side dishes .
They &apos;re gon@@ na be even better tomorrow
You know what &apos;s not a pic@@ nic ?
P@@ utting on your bedroom sli@@ pper
Thanks , D@@ ad . I &apos;ll take my chances .
I gave C@@ am &apos;s F@@ iz@@ bo costume away .
Oh , my God , he &apos;s gon@@ na kill everyone in the house .
The truck was here , and there were so many boxes ,
Listen to me .
He &apos;s not going to believe that this was an accident .
You can never , ever tell him .
He &apos;s gon@@ na know it &apos;s missing .
I mean , he pul@@ ls it out for everything .
What ?
You &apos;re cold ? I &apos;ll go get you a blan@@ k@@ et !
Well , if he was going to get the p@@ ig a blan@@ k@@ et ,
P@@ ig in a blan@@ k@@ et ?
Ok@@ ay , I te@@ ed that one up-@@ for you .
All right , it &apos;s time to fr@@ y this tur@@ key .
Som@@ ebo@@ dy please lower my sp@@ latter g@@ og@@ g@@ les , boys ?
You heard him .
You do it .
You &apos;re not the president of g@@ og@@ gle lo@@ wering .
I would be if they took a vote .
What could C@@ am have done ?
Maybe he &apos;s the one who &apos;s having an aff@@ air .
I saw a list of clu@@ es in a magazine .
Has he joined a gym or bought sexy new under@@ wear recently ?
I think it &apos;s sweet that you think
All right now , boys ,
We probably ought to do something .
Oh , I saw some champagne back there .
It &apos;s the guy on the ground !
Oh ! Take the de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ator , I &apos;ll call 9@@ 11 .
Gu@@ ys , help me out . I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m doing .
I watch a lot of &quot; Grey &apos;s An@@ atom@@ y , &quot;
No no no , we &apos;re not gon@@ na save him !
Jer@@ ry , no , Jer@@ ry .
J@@ ay@@ . get him off me !
Look at his basket . W@@ as@@ n &apos;t much of a life .
Ah , hell , I &apos;m gon@@ na regre@@ t this .
I &apos;m feeling better , P@@ rit@@ ch@@ ett . I think it was just gas .
Better safe than sorry .
Oh , I des@@ erve some of the bl@@ ame .
That &apos;s class .
The hell happened here ?
I think I felt enough for one day .
It &apos;s possible I &apos;ve been electro@@ c@@ uted one too many times .
You know , I learned something today .
I saw a man nearly die right in front of me .
And this is a constant remin@@ der
It &apos;s a lot to think about .
So I &apos;m not gon@@ na .
Phi@@ l , get me a beer .
Jer@@ ry , get me a sc@@ ot@@ ch .
I learned something to@@ day@@ . too .
It &apos;s a lot right now , Jer@@ ry .
What is all this j@@ unk ?
Fru@@ it Roll@@ -ups , chips , chocolate milk ? U@@ gh .
Th@@ -@@ There &apos;s nothing in the fridge .
I &apos;m pac@@ king you a lunch .
I &apos;ve always heard there comes a time in life
I thought it would be when I was in my 40@@ s .
But I &apos;m pretty mature for my age ,
What are you even still doing home ?
Don &apos;t you usually open your magic shop by now ?
Ye@@ ah . I &apos;m just going in a little late .
Do@@ esn &apos;t sound good for business .
And I saw you s@@ ne@@ ak those car@@ ro@@ ts out of your lunch .
I &apos;m trying to avoid one of the other shop owners .
Kind of an intim@@ id@@ ating character .
It started with a dispute over a parking space
You didn &apos;t even have to turn around .
You knew it was me .
Oh , well , Mann@@ y &apos;s at school ,
What are you t@@ ear@@ ing through ?
Nothing . Just , like , a fashion magazine .
In English , your second language .
With all that information in your head ,
H@@ ey , I &apos;ll bet you can help
I doubt it .
Give me a thri@@ ll . Take a wh@@ ack at it .
What exactly do you want me to do ?
I &apos;m sure you can figure out this clu@@ e .
Come on , one across . Help me get started .
What the hell ? !
I &apos;ll clean my room , I promise !
Dam@@ n it .
You made it to the Summit of Ex@@ more .
It@@ -@@ exists ?
I need to get these forms in by 5 : 00
Why don &apos;t we turn this party into a garden party ?
Why is your piano covered with a sheet ?
Oh , um , well , because they recommend it .
They say even five minutes of direct sun@@ light on a new piano
Ok@@ ay , well , so why doesn &apos;t everyone just ..
Ye@@ ah .

But then I see you with this , hu@@ h ?
Life must be good , eh ?

It all happened so long ago .
Little Bil@@ ly Mur@@ phy went to camp here decades ago .
And he was always picked on for being
I had this dream that when I graduated college ,
And we &apos;d have a baby . A girl .
And if she ever needed me , I would do anything for her .
Any@@ thing .
I would &apos;ve made a really great mo@@ m .
The best
It &apos;s so b@@ og@@ us !
I should have known something was up with this place .
I mean , think about it .
The cash flow , the free meals , the park@@ ing-@@ lot recei@@ p@@ ts .
Just a matter of time before
Just make him an offer for the company .
Tri@@ ed . W@@ on &apos;t sell .
Would his wi@@ dow sell ?
Maybe she could be persu@@ aded .
What is this bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it ?
That &apos;s the word on the street .
L@@ ooks like a st@@ up@@ id fu@@ cking game , you ask me .
Ye@@ ah , well , I &apos;ll tell ya ...
I don &apos;t picture Bul@@ ger
But then again , he &apos;s such a sick little fu@@ ck .
The two of them , t
I got to shut this fu@@ cking thing down , John .
Now we got people on tape
That is a big fu@@ cking problem .
That tape is just gang@@ sters talking sh@@ it
Ye@@ ah , maybe .
But I got to tell you something . Mc@@ Gu@@ ire is gon@@ na start asking questions .
That is why I &apos;m gon@@ na file it very deep .
All right ? Problem gone . G@@ one .
That &apos;s against protocol .
Fu@@ ck protocol .

You know what Jim@@ my has given us . A gold mine .

Auth@@ orities in Tul@@ sa , Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , are still si@@ fting through clu@@ es

Well , great , Jack .
Let &apos;s drop him off at the Embassy , and we can go home .
Are you kid@@ ding me ? After what happened at the safe house ?

If we see this guy in control , we &apos;re gon@@ na see the whole thing fall apart .
I &apos;m talking terrorism ,
Some@@ one has to stop him .
Well , that &apos;s what we do .
We go out to Chi@@ ap@@ ep and we do our thing .
Our thing ?

That &apos;s a tough break for a good ath@@ l@@ ete .
Jack , you know me .
Ye@@ ah , I know you . I know you .
I know him better .
Never was a file , was there , Y@@ ur@@ i ?
Of course there was no file .
It was simply ba@@ it .
What I needed was in this v@@ ault .
Cha@@ gar@@ in was the only one with enough
I used him .
It &apos;s about money .
When &apos;s it not about money ?
You want to arrest me ?
You &apos;re out of your jurisdiction , Det@@ ective Mc@@ C@@ lane , aren &apos;t you ?
I wouldn &apos;t worry too much about being arrested .
That &apos;s a hard no .
Girls , we need to store some stuff in your place .
O@@ leg and I are bab@@ y-@@ proof@@ ing our apartment .
My mo@@ m bab@@ y-@@ proof@@ ed our house for me .

Frank Del@@ ap@@ ort .
Rand@@ y , we &apos;re not on the le@@ ase to this apartment .
Ok@@ ay , I &apos;m ready .
I just need ten minutes to s@@ addle up Ch@@ est@@ nut .
It &apos;ll give me time to practice my acc@@ ent .
We &apos;re totally scre@@ wed now .
This is why we should have stayed in the hotel .
What is that supposed to mean ?
It &apos;s like you don &apos;t realize
It &apos;s like I &apos;m in a relationship
Again .
You know , your life can be a whole lot better
Why don &apos;t you just ham@@ mer the nail in ?
Because we are used to it .
We just ign@@ ore it , like the rain in my bedroom .
Well , Rand@@ y &apos;s dead .
No matter how many boy@@ friends I bury ,
I can &apos;t believe we &apos;re getting k@@ ick@@ ed out like this .
In my fant@@ asy . I bought the building
T@@ ook care of the land@@ lord .
You killed him ?
I &apos;ll call O@@ leg ; we &apos;ll get his friend &apos;s truck
Ok@@ ay , first , I believe that you have
But nobody &apos;s dead .
I just explained to him the situation ,
All right , which one of us has to mar@@ ry him ?
Body Ro@@ cket with Pap@@ o ,

And , u@@ h , don &apos;t forget my new hat .

Any@@ thing else ?
Agent Ro@@ cker , DE@@ A .
The second he w@@ akes up . I need to know .
You got it .
Let &apos;s go piece this together -
We estimate that nearly 1,000 pounds of co@@ ca@@ ine
We &apos;re on the front line .
And on the front line , we can &apos;t afford to fu@@ ck up .
Bre@@ aking up these drug cart@@ els
I &apos;m all ears .
A lot of shooting
I &apos;m still checking the tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory on that .
I mean , this guy , he probably dropped his piece
And that &apos;s . .@@ - Smart .
Ye@@ ah . Well , he did take one .
Mike , I &apos;m gon@@ na have to call you back .
I &apos;ll get .. I &apos;ll get right back to you .
Son of a b@@ itch . Bre@@ ak in my house ?
Hi , Sh@@ eri@@ ff . We need to talk .
S@@ it down !
Ye@@ ah , well , it &apos;s been a long day .
You know , I heard about that .
But I got a problem I think you can help me with .
Ok@@ ay . What &apos;s that ?
Now , you know me . You know who I am .
Every@@ body knows who you are .
Some@@ one st@@ ole a lot of money from me .
That I can live with .
But where you can help me is to figure out who killed my men .
First of all , I &apos;m gon@@ na tell you ..
When we got there , they were already dead
You &apos;re alive , aren &apos;t you ?
U@@ h-@@ hu@@ h . Look , I just don &apos;t know .
I just don &apos;t know how I can help you , Mat@@ eo .
One of them was my son .
He shot Sam@@ my , and ... and I tried to help him ,
Look , we thought they were dead .
Tell me about him
And then he shot me
I swe@@ ar to God . I have no idea who these people are
Un@@ less you were planning on going somewhere .
The DE@@ A has taken over
Work with them .
I &apos;ll really make it worth your while .
Well , u@@ h ..
that sounds just fine , Mr. Per@@ ez .
This guy st@@ ole $ 3 million from me .
and I &apos;ll give you a hef@@ ty finder &apos;s fee .
And then you can just go on your mer@@ ry way .
Now that sounds like a good deal .
You gon@@ na keep pointing that gun at me , partner ?
Ok@@ ay .
Keep som@@ ebo@@ dy on him .
Jet &apos;s find out where it takes US
That &apos;s loc@@ o ! Hell , no . Come on .
Col@@ e
Can you run a history ?
S@@ ure . What are the numbers ?
Fo@@ x@@ tro@@ t , Golf , Seven , N@@ ine , Six , One , Hotel
People
Mat@@ eo Daniel Per@@ ez was spot@@ ted
Now , what &apos;s a drug lord like Mat@@ eo
And to top it all off
Now , people ..
we &apos;ve had a guy on the inside of Per@@ ez &apos;s gang
I don &apos;t remember a go@@ d@@ dam@@ n thing
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s just temporary .
No ! It &apos;s not temporary .
I &apos;m in trouble here .
Any@@ thing can get fixed .
You &apos;ll be fine . Everything will be fine .
I shot a co@@ p . I killed him .
I know I shot other people , too . I just .. I just can &apos;t remember !
I can &apos;t remember a fu@@ cking thing !
I am gon@@ na take care of you .
Sh@@ it .
So , the m@@ ess was man@@ -@@ made .
What did you do with it ?
What do you mean , what &apos;d I do with it ?
thre@@ w it in the tr@@ ash
I get the picture .
You got cameras in the bathrooms ?
Now , si@@ r ..
you know that is so illegal .
Show me where you thre@@ w the tr@@ ash .
I &apos;m gon@@ na need to see foot@@ age from that camera .
I don &apos;t think the DE@@ A &apos;s gon@@ na go that far .
You know who Sam &apos;s old man is ?
Mat@@ eo Per@@ ez
Jes@@ Us . What &apos;d you get yourself into ?
Now , he paid me a private visit .
He wants me to find the guy and hand him over .
Well , what are you gon@@ na do ?
I &apos;m gon@@ na find this son of a b@@ itch and hand him over .
Well , what if you don &apos;t ?
You and I have seen enough dead bodies of people
Now , you know go@@ d@@ dam@@ n well I didn &apos;t kill Sam .
I just need a little time to get out from under@@ ne@@ ath this .
All right .
I &apos;ll tell you what I &apos;m gon@@ na do .
I &apos;m gon@@ na forget the DE@@ A .
I will shoot you .
It was all about the money , hu@@ h , Chris ?
It &apos;s always about the money , honey .
Now get me the fu@@ cking money !
Oh , baby .
You know , maybe we should just get married .
That way I can get you your green card .
Things work out , maybe I &apos;ll even get you a boo@@ b job .
A@@ w , sh@@ it .
Ye@@ ah , Mike ?
Now , you didn &apos;t get this from me .
You don &apos;t know him like I do .
I@@ e &apos;s a monster .
Fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; dam@@ ned rap@@ ist .
He rap@@ ed me .. again and again .
Do you know how that feels ? !
You promised to help me get out of here .
You give me that money right now !
Dro@@ p your fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; g@@ uns .
Dro@@ p the fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; gun !
Put it down , mo@@ ther@@ fu@@ cker !
Sh@@ it .
Did you miss me ?
I &apos;m sure glad to see you .
You seriously fu@@ cked up my day , son .
You took my money , and you left me with Mat@@ eo Per@@ ez .
You d@@ umb sh@@ it . We could have been partners on this .
Go@@ d@@ dam@@ n ! I didn &apos;t think I &apos;d see you again .
Well , next time you better kill me all the way .
Well , next time , I &apos;ll remember that .
Don &apos;t strain yourself .
I could give two sh@@ its about the trouble you got yourself into .
Or why you killed the k@@ id !
K@@ id ?
All I care about is the go@@ d@@ dam@@ n money !
Now where the fu@@ ck is it ? !
That don &apos;t look like $ 3 million , as@@ sh@@ ole !
Now where &apos;s the rest ? !
I might have put that money somewhere safe .
Now , where exactly did you put it ? !
Well , see , that &apos;s the problem .
With all this head@@ -@@ trau@@ ma sh@@ it , I can &apos;t remember .
I &apos;m not gon@@ na ask you again .
Yes , ma &apos;@@ am .
I think we found our guy .
Several traffic c@@ ams show a van b@@ lowing through red lights .
It &apos;s now in the parking garage at The Stre@@ am@@ line Bus Station .
I ran the plates , and the van belongs to Fer@@ ez .
Why ? You now have the offer of command in writing .
Yes , well , a li@@ ar &apos;s word is wor@@ th@@ less , even ON paper .
You know I &apos;d love you just as much if you were a mer@@ chant captain ?
And you wouldn &apos;t be gone for two years .
I won &apos;t be gone two years .
She lost two men and still with her h@@ ull half empty .
Well , they were from Bed@@ ford and they didn &apos;t have me abo@@ ard .
Son of a b@@ itch !
I will captain my own ship ..
a wh@@ aling ship .
Up to them all we &apos;d ever have is a patch of dirt
What &apos;s wrong with his words ?
He wanted things for his family , for himself .
I@@ le was a dre@@ amer , O@@ wen
Dre@@ amed of the sea and never got to sea with men like them .
At least he got to see his children born .
It &apos;s all I know .
I &apos;ll come back as quick as the sun is night , I swe@@ ar .
Please come back ... . promise me .
I already s@@ wor@@ e to you , now you want me to promise , too .
I promise .
Son , a word with you .
To be a captain , you cannot be a friend , you are their superior .
Never forget that , never let TH@@ EM forget that .
Thank you , son .
Your great@@ -@@ grand@@ father and a few others created this industry .
Without us , without you , the world pl@@ ung@@ es into darkness .
I hope to bring honor to the P@@ oll@@ ard family name , Sir .
That won@@ dro@@ us monster of a mighty length ;
But , ever@@ lasting God , thou d@@ ost or@@ da@@ in that we , poor fe@@ eb@@ le mort@@ als
O Father , grant that your gl@@ orious light shine on these men ,
So that the white wh@@ ales of Nan@@ tu@@ cket wh@@ ale oil
So , what month is this ?
Oh , late in the year , we were one of the last ships to go out .
Which is why my friend Bar@@ z@@ il@@ la@@ i and I got a ber@@ th .
Look , I was four@@ teen ... four@@ teen .
Stand clear !
Nice piece of work , Mr. Ch@@ ase !
If we make Cape Ver@@ des in the next 2 weeks we &apos;ll
Cor@@ n , Mr. Ch@@ ase ?
No , thank you , Sir , never did have much of a taste for it .
That &apos;s od@@ d .
So , your father grew corn on Cape Co@@ d .
That &apos;s right , he did .
As you can imagine , I suddenly grew tired of eating it every day .
Cor@@ n , ok@@ ra , be@@ ans , I believe ? Before he went to j@@ ail .
Are you familiar with this story , Mr. Jo@@ y ?
orph@@ an@@ ed due to his father &apos;s incar@@ cer@@ ation ?
Well , we all have our paths to sea .
That &apos;s a mo@@ tive to not ask too many questions .
Can &apos;t have been easy though , yet ..
You had Nan@@ tu@@ cket &apos;s great seaf@@ aring family to adopt you .
Now , if the captain will exc@@ use me , there are wh@@ ale boats and watches to assi@@ gn .
No , Sir , not for me .
Not a drop ?
No , Sir , like I said , sometimes the fewer questions one asks , the better .
That &apos;s a gor@@ geous girl , Mr. Jo@@ y .
No tou@@ ching !
I always thought you were married anyway .
I am , and there she is .
Well , that &apos;s her nose anyway .
Con@@ grat@@ ulations , ladies .
A@@ ye , Sir .
There &apos;ll be six men to a boat , first rules in the row , six b@@ ells sharp .
We &apos;re not even east of H@@ ali@@ fax , Sir .
What &apos;s your name ?
Coff@@ in , Henry Coff@@ in .
He &apos;s the Captain &apos;s c@@ ousin , Sir .
Well , well , Mr. Coff@@ in , do you think a wh@@ ale knows it &apos;s east of H@@ ali@@ fax ?
I don &apos;t know who all of you are , or how you got here ,
That &apos;s fine , I don &apos;t give a dam@@ n , but we inter@@ red you for just one thing ...
and one thing only , and that is wh@@ ale oil .
I intend to fill our 2000 bar@@ rels and be home as quickly as possible .
And even when the weather is fine and there AR@@ E no wh@@ ales , Mr. Coff@@ in ,
We are two days behind .
You need to make up the time before we catch the east wind .
Set st@@ uns &apos;s .
Bel@@ ay that , set st@@ uns &apos;s .
Get her off , Mr. Coff@@ in , the Captain wants speed !
A@@ ye , Sir .
She might be old but she can still b@@ low , boys !
Sir , a squ@@ all on the star@@ board route , we need to shor@@ ten the sa@@ il immediately .
Sir , we are headed into a storm of more than 8 k@@ not@@ s
Let it come , the men are soft from months on land , they
If we don &apos;t shor@@ ten sa@@ il and bear off it &apos;ll catch us on the beam .
Ch@@ ase , we will stand on .
Mr. La@@ wr@@ ence , hold our course .
Holding course , Sir .
We &apos;ll lose half a day running like that .
Best secure for heavy weather .
Best prepare for weather , Mr. B@@ ond , we &apos;re headed into a squ@@ all .
We must fall off and run with it .
Stand down , Mr. Ch@@ ase .
Mr. La@@ wr@@ ence , hold your course .
Holding course , Sir .
Sh@@ orten the s@@ ails Mr. Ch@@ ase .
We need to cut those s@@ ails down !
Turn the ship , head for land !
No , the damage is done !
It &apos;s too late , it &apos;s too god dam@@ ned late !
Captain George P@@ oll@@ ard , the Es@@ sex .
Cap@@ i@@ tian Cl@@ em@@ ente Pel@@ a@@ ez , the Santa Maria .
Would you buy a colleague a drink ?
S@@ ame as always , George .
Yes , Captain
How far out ?
Far enough for only a f@@ ool to go .
How far would that be ?
A thousand le@@ agues along the Equ@@ ator ...
in off@@ shore grounds .
W@@ ere there wh@@ ales there ?
More than you &apos;ve ever dre@@ amt .
Sir , what are you doing ?
Where is he ?
It could be Du@@ c@@ ie Island .
Without a map , comp@@ ass or quad@@ rant there &apos;s no way to be certain .
We will keep fir@@ es going night and day ,
This is what I wanted you to see .
They &apos;ve been here a long time , for no doubt ..
waiting for a ship .
But no ship came .
No ship is going to come .
If we stay , we die .
How long do you think it would take to trust the birds
It &apos;s a privil@@ ege to know the moment of one &apos;s death in advance .
And to be able to prepare for it ..
a cur@@ se to be so far from home ...
or a chance to say good@@ by@@ es , without a chance to make peace ...
or a chance to sett@@ le scores .
But al@@ as , at least those are settled between us
Captain of what ?
It was as if O@@ wen Ch@@ ase himself had spoken .
He told them the truth .
Cap &apos;@@ n P@@ oll@@ ard &apos;s conscience was clear ..
but the inquiry was a s@@ ham .
over the white wh@@ ale .. they never found it .
He ran a second ship around off of Hawaii ..
twice cur@@ sed .
then take over our plan@@ ets .
Hor@@ rors that you remember
It &apos;s all blan@@ k . My life .
You &apos;re supposed to take the form
Perhaps this is a mercy
Fre@@ eing you to do what all K@@ ree must .
Put your people &apos;s needs before your own .
We &apos;ve given you a great gift .
The chance to fight for the good of all K@@ ree .
I want to serve .
Then master yourself .
What was given can be taken away .
I won &apos;t let you down .
We &apos;ll know soon enough .
You have a mission .
Ser@@ ve well , and with honor .
This can &apos;t be good .
We sli@@ p in , we locate Soh@@ -@@ Lar@@ r ..
and we get out , leaving them none the wis@@ er .
The Tor@@ fan popul@@ ace .
We are not to inter@@ f@@ ere with them ,
Nothing com@@ promises the security of our mission .
Proc@@ eed with cau@@ tion .
Follow protocol before extrac@@ ting him .
This is a dangerous mission .
We must all be ready to join the Coll@@ ective
For the good of all K@@ ree !
Ver@@ s , track Soh@@ -@@ Lar@@ r &apos;s be@@ ac@@ on .

No . The DNA would match .
Want my AO@@ L password ?

That is the cra@@ zi@@ est sh@@ it I ever heard .
Green trans@@ forming ali@@ ens ? There &apos;s no such thing .
You are absolutely right , young lady .
There is no such thing .
That system is f@@ alli@@ ble , as we &apos;ve learned .
Ok@@ ay , then let &apos;s do this .
Who do I see when I comm@@ une with the Supreme Intelligence ?
The person you most ad@@ mire and respect , I &apos;d gu@@ ess .
But you would never tell me who .
And what is your earliest memory of Hal@@ a ?
The trans@@ fusion .
Blue blood running through my v@@ eins .
Wh@@ ose blood ?
That &apos;s my blood that &apos;s cour@@ sing through her v@@ eins .
What have you done with her ?

She knows ?
Come at once .
For the good of all K@@ ree , Commander ,

Well , is it in front of all that nothing , or behind it ?
What did you do to your uniform ?
They got in her head . Just like we thought .
The Supreme Intelligence will set her straight .
You can see they &apos;re not soldiers .
Let &apos; em go . You can have me .
And the core ?
You lied to me .
I made you the best version of yourself .
What &apos;s given can be taken away .
Back here ! Mo@@ ve , move !
Get over here . Get down !
Let &apos;s go ! Go , move !
There she is .

Shel@@ don , we &apos;ve been through this .

Not the ro@@ omm@@ ate agreement .
Indeed , the ro@@ omm@@ ate agreement .
I call your attention to the Friend@@ ship Ri@@ der
&quot; Number 37 : in the event one friend is ever invited
You actually put that in an agreement ?
Ye@@ ah . We also put in what happens
He can &apos;t kill me , even if I turn .
Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend ?
Ye@@ ah . He thinks I betra@@ yed him .
I mean , come on . What would you guys do if you were me ?
I &apos;d take Shel@@ don to Switzerland .
Seri@@ ously ?

Oh , I won &apos;t be a moment . I just need to gra@@ b a book

My p@@ ier@@ cing , blue eye .
Shel@@ don !
Fine .

G@@ ot it .
And if he brings it up , change the subject
I got it .
But not the Corn@@ hus@@ kers . Do not discuss the Corn@@ hus@@ kers .

Never mind , you &apos;re good .

Can I get you something to drink ? Maybe a beer ?
S@@ ure , if you &apos;re having one .
Ok@@ ay .
And why wouldn &apos;t you , since you &apos;re not pregnant ?
Leon@@ ard wants to have a baby with my ex-@@ boy@@ friend Z@@ ack .
How would you say it ?
U@@ h , same words , just less angry .
Well , I don &apos;t know about Los Angeles ,
It &apos;s strange here , too , and we have a bak@@ ery for dogs .
And you &apos;re ok@@ ay with this ?
I support my husband .
Thank you .
But , you know , if you think differently ,
Are you guys ready for the most intense experience of your life ?
Yes .
Defin@@ itely .
Not to bra@@ g , but I &apos;m an a@@ stron@@ aut ,
Can be pretty sc@@ ary .
Please , I &apos;m , like , 90 pounds .
I &apos;m wei@@ ght@@ less every time I hold more than three ballo@@ ons .
Ok@@ ay , I just need you guys to sign these wa@@ i@@ vers ,
There are a lot of pages here .
Is this a wa@@ i@@ ver or a screen@@ play you &apos;ve been working on ?
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s just bo@@ il@@ er@@ plate .
Absol@@ utely . It &apos;s to protect us in case of injury .
It says , &quot; or death . &quot;
D@@ one .
Where are the changing rooms ?
Dres@@ sing rooms are in the back .
No pe@@ ek@@ ing .
Here you go .
Ok@@ ay . Should we go get changed ?
What am I doing ?
If you don &apos;t want to do this ,
To prove to Howard that he doesn &apos;t know me as well
L@@ ooks like he does .
Un@@ less I do it and then he doesn &apos;t .
Why not just be honest ?
You &apos;re right .
I should be honest .
You ow@@ e me $ 3,000 for those plane tickets to l@@ n@@ dia !
That was a long run .
Ye@@ ah . Well , I was in the zone .
You know , and then in a din@@ er
Are you avo@@ iding me ?
Well , I took a n@@ ap next to Hot Do@@ g on a Sti@@ ck .
What do you think ?
I think you &apos;re mad at me and Leon@@ ard ,
Why would I be mad at myself ?
A couple of questions
Have you seen any of these men ?
Sor@@ r@@ y.@@ I don &apos;t recognize any of them
P@@ ull over up there .
We &apos;re going to have to insp@@ ect your car .
But I thought you said
Now pull over .
Do you want some water ?
Or do you want to tell me where Michael Sco@@ field is ?
I don &apos;t know where he is .
You know , from the first day you started here .
I gu@@ ess I just know a con when I see one , hu@@ h ?
Maybe you &apos;ll get to be employee of the month .
I &apos;m waiting .
There &apos;s been a change in venue .
Oh , well , well , well .
I finally get to talk to the bra@@ ins of the out@@ fit .
We &apos;re at the Plaza De Fran@@ cia .
So you &apos;re thinking public place , safety in numbers ,
I &apos;m thinking public place , wanted men , police ,
You don &apos;t want to help , then don &apos;t .
Get ou@@ tt@@ a here sho@@ o fly
Then it &apos;s home , sweet home .
This is my house
Get out
He &apos;s gon@@ na get us out of here .
In between jobs .
O@@ h. sorry to hear that .
Ye@@ ah , we &apos;ve all been there .
I &apos;m sure something will come up before long .
I &apos;m hop@@ ing it &apos;s right around the corner .
Here .
You won &apos;t be ne@@ eding this anymore .
What &apos;s this for ?
You &apos;re gon@@ na give me some real information on Michael Sco@@ field .
Or it &apos;s gon@@ na be your fun@@ eral .
I don &apos;t know where he is .
I don &apos;t know how to reach him , I swe@@ ar .
I take off@@ ense , pat@@ ron .
I &apos;ve had many foot@@ -@@ wash@@ ers .
Many men have come in with sheep &apos;s clothing ,
I am not trying to hurt you . I am trying to save you .
Save me ?
I &apos;m gon@@ na die here .
Your life is in je@@ op@@ ar@@ dy just being with me .
Not necessarily .
As I was being es@@ cor@@ ted back inside today , one of the guards
If a guard spoke to you , he was lying .
It &apos;s impossible to get out .
Maybe you &apos;ve been too busy dying to notice ,
I found this in his pocket .
Would you care
I &apos;ve got no idea what it is .
It &apos;s from the gift ship .
It &apos;s plastic .
Now , if you &apos;ll exc@@ use us .
What ?
Stay where you are .
Why ? where is your identification ?
H@@ ey , come on , guys , focus .
Oh , mighty Nicolas C@@ age tree ,
Oh , Lu@@ cy &apos;s free after all .
See ya .
H@@ ey , h@@ ey , h@@ ey , you can &apos;t leave .

B@@ ye .

Not that it &apos;s up to you to make me happy .
Sorry . I-@@ I &apos;m just saying , if you ever wanted
Sweet again , but I think that might be a little wei@@ rd
Ye@@ ah , I get that .
I just wouldn &apos;t for@@ give myself if I didn &apos;t ask .
But never worry if you &apos;re gon@@ na be ok@@ ay , Lyn@@ ette .
You will . You are the exact kind of woman
You &apos;re welcome .
Oh , h@@ ey , I &apos;m off on Friday ,
U@@ h , bad news . U@@ h , I checked the weather up there .
It looks like rain for this weekend .
So ? I wasn &apos;t seeing us spending a lot of time out@@ doors .

&quot; Horiz@@ ont@@ al &quot; to catch up on .
It &apos;s kind of been a while , has@@ n &apos;t it ?
Well , I gu@@ ess , with , u@@ h , work and everything .
A cabin , the rain ..
A bed .
It &apos;s gon@@ na be a good weekend .
Yes , Lyn@@ ette had tried hard
H@@ ey , Greg@@ g .
But sometimes , the low road was easier to find .
Carlos Soli@@ s was used to sitting in a position of power ,
at the head of a power lunch ...
or at the hel@@ m of a powerful company .
But now that Carlos Soli@@ s had started a new career ,
So .. what do you think of my new office ?
A@@ w , that &apos;s so sweet .
You &apos;re lying to spare your d@@ ad@@ dy &apos;s feelings .
Seri@@ ously , . honey , there &apos;s a guy down at the department store

Well , thank good@@ ness I have the most tal@@ ented partner .
Now come on . We &apos;re wa@@ sting time .
Let &apos;s get ham@@ mer@@ ing .
Seri@@ ously ? You &apos;re telling me
I &apos;ve just seen too many cases
Not my clients , of course .
Well , I just think our society &apos;s gotten too soft .
We need a powerful deter@@ rent to stop these k@@ ill@@ ers .
You do realize you &apos;re not on trial
But not about a murder .
Tell me what &apos;s going on , or I &apos;m walking out of this house .
You &apos;re gon@@ na need to let me think about it .
I don &apos;t believe this .
My , u@@ h , my first husband kept secrets from me ,
I &apos;m not going down this road again .
Gab@@ y , why is there an old lady
Do you have any idea who that is ?
I think my gen@@ eric reference to her as &quot; Old lady &quot;
She &apos;s Dor@@ is Ham@@ mond ,

Gu@@ y made a killing in private equity .
Why is she here ?

Ye@@ ah , it &apos;s great .
Oh , I almost had a heart attack when I saw the price .
I gu@@ ess I just have to get comfortable
That &apos;s right , and tomorrow when the new fall line comes in ,
So , Carlos ..
What is it you do ?
I ... work for a non@@ profit that helps re@@ covering ad@@ dic@@ ts .
Oh , I &apos;m sorry .
Was Carlos talking about his charity ?
Good thing we weren &apos;t operating heavy machinery ,
You &apos;ll have to exc@@ use my wife .
Not the biggest fan of what I do .
Oh , that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
Phil@@ anthrop@@ y is very important .
My Bill gave gener@@ ously to many worthy causes .
Ok@@ ay , if we &apos;re gon@@ na keep talking about charity ,
Boy , Bill left quite a leg@@ acy .
All right . You know what ? Will you just sit down and be quiet ?
Did you check your blood sugar ?

I &apos;m sorry .
Right . I should &apos;ve known what you &apos;d say .
No , no , no . You don &apos;t get to do that .
You don &apos;t get to ask me to fund a plan this half-@@ ass@@ ed
Come on .
I mean , y@@ e@@ ah , there are people that can do this sort of thing ,
Mrs. Pul@@ cher .
Is it two hours already ?
It seems like I saw your sl@@ ack j@@ aw a minute ago .
Or you could do something good with the money .
Don@@ ate it to a good cause , help someone out .
Or put it to getting you a medical degree .
Mrs. Pul@@ cher ,
You ask@@ in &apos; me for money ?
I need at least 100 grand to get things started .
Oh , my God .
Take it somewhere else , S@@ ally Stru@@ thers ,
Overall , Ad@@ ele scored a 23 , which is a marked decline
So she &apos;s definitely a lot worse than we thought .
Well , the up@@ side is , she gets in the trial .
But she &apos;s dec@@ lining so fast .
I know .
Why can &apos;t we just give her the medicine on the side
No . The F.@@ D.@@ A. is gon@@ na be on us harder than ever .
Don &apos;t think I haven &apos;t thought about it .
She &apos;s in heart failure .
She &apos;s got@@ ta go back on the vent .
She needs surgery now ?
Well , as soon as possible .
So should I get her pre@@ pped ?
Ye@@ ah , looks like I &apos;m stuck with you , too , hu@@ h ?

One more lap .
What , did you lose a bet ?
She &apos;s my new physical therap@@ ist
Wh@@ ose charts are those ?

So you st@@ ole her charts ?
Yes , I st@@ ole her charts ,
Grey , sit . I need the resistance .
She &apos;s worse than we thought .
But at least she &apos;s gon@@ na get in the trial .
Ok@@ ay , see ? ! See ? ! I should be on this .
How do I even have a shot at chief resident
Alex , you didn &apos;t . You &apos;re gon@@ na be fired .
I &apos;m gon@@ na be chief resident .
Ye@@ ah , not if you don &apos;t work here anymore .
He so@@ lic@@ ited a patient for money .
No , my African k@@ id thing .
It &apos;s against so many rules .
Who car@@ es ? The old ha@@ g could die ,
But instead , she &apos;ll probably leave it to her cats ,
U@@ h , h@@ ey , everybody . Off . Now .
C@@ alli@@ e .
I did four l@@ aps today .
Sofia needs surgery .

Today . Now . She has weak@@ ness in her left v@@ entri@@ cle .

Right now they &apos;re eating $ 8 airport ham@@ bur@@ gers
Great .
Maybe you can help me find a clear route to the CIA dro@@ p-@@ off .
L@@ ooks like they &apos;re doing some serious renov@@ ations down here .
Listen to me carefully , Leon .
Your mission has been abor@@ ted .
The U@@ . S. is going to pull out of the country .
What ? I just got here .
After taking me off fur@@ l@@ ough and sending me to this
What the hell ?
Washington and the government there have decided to go their separate ways .
Everyone has to leave , not just em@@ bass@@ y staff
I don &apos;t give a dam@@ n about the politics .
If we don &apos;t stop them now ,
Do you really w@@ anna see that ?
This is a war and things are different .
No one can do anything without backup from the American government .
Not even you .
Well then , I gu@@ ess my only option is to
Leon !
She can tell them I got lost and missed my flight .
Better hur@@ ry up and get this done .
I need some breakfast .
S@@ car@@ ec@@ row .
I &apos;m the T@@ in Man . Can you talk ?
I don &apos;t want to cause any more trouble .
It &apos;s time to say good@@ b@@ ye .
Wa@@ it .
You know , I didn &apos;t really care about independence .
All I wanted was to have fun with you and my friends .
And ..
I was looking forward to showing you America .
Trust me ,
The person who released the Pla@@ ga .
Just as I thought , you haven &apos;t a clu@@ e .
I am the president of this country .
So that &apos;s what Ad@@ a meant .
He is an enemy of the state . Kill him !
Cre@@ atures broke through
Open fire !
C@@ ease fire . C@@ ease fire .
Help me !
Help !
What will you gain by killing me ?
Have you thought this through ?
Who will lead the country once you gain independence ?
You ?
I have no intention of taking advice
In case you &apos;re interested ,
have been happening in the world .
We don &apos;t have time to fight amongst ourselves
Sh@@ ut up !
Oh , great . It just keeps getting better .
We have to go .
Sv@@ et@@ lan@@ a !
A bio@@ haz@@ ard release has been detected .
Ok@@ ay , this is only a dr@@ y-@@ run , and it &apos;s the first of many .
W@@ on &apos;t be perfect , but once we start ,
Agre@@ ed ?
Ok@@ ay .
Let &apos;s go .
Y@@ ep .
It makes a wei@@ rd kind of sense .
If you plan on sa@@ wing a person in half ,
When you take the stage and all eyes are on you ,
Three days ago , I received a call
A consult was requested for a 3@@ 5-@@ year-old male patient
You only want them to see the magic .
Sec@@ on@@ ded .
Tra@@ ditionally , a tum@@ or like this
There &apos;s got to be something better than that .
Tor@@ res thought so , too .
She had a better idea .
No@@ body was listening to each other .
Dan@@ ielle hit her tri@@ ck too soon ,
Are you kid@@ ding ? We were in the final round !
We were about to quali@@ fy for Nation@@ als !
S@@ light ten@@ derness to the ab@@ dom@@ en ,
Oh , my God . Dan@@ i , are you ok@@ ay ? !
Everything hur@@ ts .
I &apos;ll gra@@ b it if you let me watch .
The bon@@ e-@@ gra@@ ft retri@@ eval .
Sorry , we &apos;re a military hospital .
I-@@ I see mostly trau@@ ma-@@ related pat@@ ch@@ -up jobs .
You have a reputation for a much more refined approach .
My reputation ? I have a reputation ?
I Goog@@ led you .
I mean , I Goog@@ led all of you .
Everyone &apos;s really excited about the surgery .
We don &apos;t get a lot of chances
Um , you know what ? Ye@@ ah . S@@ ure .
You can watch .
Thank you .
C@@ ould she fli@@ rt any harder ?
What ? No@@ body &apos;s fli@@ r@@ ting with any@@ body .
Oh , come on . &quot; I Goog@@ led you &quot; ?
She was totally fli@@ r@@ ting . So were you .
I was not ! What did I even say ?
You didn &apos;t have to say anything .
All of this .. is a fli@@ rt .
I &apos;m gon@@ na need you to be still .
I mean , she bar@@ ely even looks hurt
Max@@ ine scre@@ wed us .
Dan@@ ielle &apos;s the one who thre@@ w us off .
She didn &apos;t put her weight in her he@@ el
What ? Are you trying to break it more ?
I am so over them .
We have worked too hard and sacrific@@ ed too much
They are out .
Down .
That girl is the reason I h@@ ated high school .
What a power trip .
She can &apos;t just k@@ ick som@@ ebo@@ dy off the team .
Are you kid@@ ding me ? She &apos;s the power center here .
She &apos;s che@@ er captain and squ@@ ad leader .
What &apos;s the difference ?
You see the way they all look at her .
She &apos;s the top of the social food chain .
She calls all the shots , decides who &apos;s in , who &apos;s out .
She says jump , they ask , &quot; Off which bridge ? &quot;
D-@@ Do you need something ?
Ye@@ ah , I-@@ I need you .
Where the hell is Mit@@ ch@@ ell ?
I think you should call it . H-@@ He &apos;s been down a long time .
Sh@@ ut up . Just shut up , please .
I think I got a f@@ ain@@ t pul@@ se .
I think that &apos;s your pul@@ se you &apos;re feeling .
I got to open him up now . If I don &apos;t , he &apos;s dead .
Again , I &apos;m not gon@@ na allow you
I &apos;ve got no way to do@@ ck the leg .
We don &apos;t have a fall@@ back plan here .
Ok@@ ay , I need you to hear me .
This is not a matter of confidence , ok@@ ay ?
It &apos;s not me . It is the bone .
I am saying that , with the pel@@ vis that I have left ,
Well , you better do something .
She &apos;s right . Look , if we stop now ,
He &apos;s not gon@@ na survive the night .
Yes . The young la@@ d there .
I will . Thank you .
You should have a clo@@ ak for a day like this .
Er@@ am@@ c@@ is will take care of me .
V@@ e are to be married soon .
Goo@@ d-@@ b@@ ye .
Come on , a dec@@ ent wage .
Make your family proud .
Food , shel@@ ter . Who will join us ?
Go and wake up the other farms !
Get them down here ! We need more hands !

W@@ ake them up !
Go and get the Smith brothers first .
We lose the bar@@ n , we lose everything
Look sharp , men , the far@@ mer &apos;s here .
Mr. O@@ ak , is that you ?
Perhaps you want a sh@@ ep@@ herd , ma &apos;@@ am ?
I ow@@ e you an immense debt , Mr. O@@ ak .
You are dism@@ is@@ sed .
Get out while you can , if I were you .
Now you &apos;ve all met our new sh@@ ep@@ herd , Mr. O@@ ak .
You understand your duties , Mr. O@@ ak ?
If I don &apos;t , I &apos;ll ask , ma &apos;@@ am .
He &apos;s rich , he &apos;s hand@@ some . He sends the local girls mad .
The Taylor sisters worked on him for two years .
Jane Per@@ kins spent 20 on new clothes
It &apos;s said , when he was young , his swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ t j@@ il@@ ted him .
People always say that .
In re@@ j@@ ecting you , perhaps ?
I &apos;ve long given up thinking of that .
Or wish@@ ing it , either .
But I will say this .
Le@@ ading on a man you don &apos;t care for is bene@@ ath you .
I cannot allow a man to cri@@ tici@@ ze my private conduct .
You will please leave the farm at the end of the week .
I &apos;d prefer to go at once .
Then go . I never want to see your face again .
Very well , Miss Ever@@ dene .
Who@@ a , there we are . There .
What &apos;s wrong with them ?
They broke f@@ ence and ate the young clo@@ ver .
Mak@@ es their stom@@ ach@@ s s@@ well .
What can we do now
You mean they &apos;re all going to die ?
I hope I didn &apos;t start@@ le you .
We &apos;ve got h@@ it@@ ched together somehow .
Here , allow me .
No . No . F@@ Please , let me do it myself .
If you lift your foot for a moment .
F@@ Please don &apos;t st@@ are
I don &apos;t think I &apos;ve ever seen a face as beautiful as yours .
You sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be here . Please let me have the lamp .
A mighty impressive harvest this looks like .
Miss ,
Serge@@ ant Francis Tro@@ y .
Nob@@ le blood , full of promise . Very sharp and tri@@ m .
Well@@ -@@ educated .
There was good things expected of him .
e thre@@ w it al in to be a soldi@@ er
I &apos;m going to tell him to leave .
I must absolutely ins@@ ist that you leave at this very moment .
I can &apos;t .
Will you follow me , please ?
What angers you , exactly ?
I &apos;m quite happy to walk by myself .
You should have nothing to do with him .
He &apos;s not good enough for you .
He &apos;s a perfectly dec@@ ent man .
That &apos;s not what I believe
Frank , perhaps we ought to .. No .
Dar@@ ling , it &apos;s our wedding celebration .

And why sh@@ ouldn &apos;t there be stronger links
A share of my profits .
Miss Ever@@ dene needs me here .
And her farm will have priority .
I &apos;d still need Miss Ever@@ dene &apos;s permission .
But , of course .
Of course , I wouldn &apos;t d@@ are do anything

You will , si@@ r .
H@@ ey , Geor@@ gie .
Come on . Come on .
Gabriel , you &apos;re getting on in the world .
Of course you must accept the offer .
Only with your approval .
If I lose the farm , there may be no future
You know where my loyalty lies .
You &apos;re a man of great talent , it &apos;s only natural using it right .
Yes . Very much .
Which is it ? Like or respect ?
It is difficult for a woman to define her feelings
If you worry about a lack of passion on your part ,
don &apos;t mind .
When must you give your answer ?
By Christmas .
It &apos;s a terrible responsibility .
I hold that man &apos;s future in my hands .
His san@@ ity , too , perhaps .
C@@ ould you care for him ?
You may supp@@ ose love is w@@ anting
Why are you asking me ?
I need someone who &apos;s objective .
Well , I accepted you , H@@ an .
Yes , thank you . You make my heart sing .
Wo@@ o !
Hur@@ ts me still .
That was like watching someone club a baby seal .
Why wouldn &apos;t you just say yes to his friend request ?
Because I never check fac@@ ebook , why would I ?
So some girl i worked at a movie theater with in 2005
Maybe someone just post on your wall .
You have an air condition@@ er that works ?
Oh , it works .

There &apos;s more sal@@ ami where that came from .
And my feet hurt .
I mean , I can &apos;t believe it .
Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t you see me cr@@ ying ?
L@@ ots of people cry at Good@@ will .
You go to France , you eat sn@@ ails . You come here , you cry .
That &apos;s od@@ d , you didn &apos;t even react .
You need to react when people cry .
I did , I rolled my eyes .
Look , eventually , you &apos;ll learn to do that on the inside .
Ok@@ ay , well , just F@@ Y@@ I ,
Are your girl@@ friends black drag qu@@ e@@ ens ?
Oh , a@@ wesome Stro@@ kes te@@ e .
I went to this concert , but I couldn &apos;t afford the shirt .
Oh , we &apos;re done with me .
I went to see them on this tour the summer after my j@@ um@@ ior year .
It was a really warm night , and I s@@ nu@@ ck out of the house ,
Wh@@ atever .
And what ?
What , did something great happen the night you got the T ?
Look at me , does it look like something great ever happens ?
H@@ ey , cute te@@ e . H@@ ad my eye on it .
That &apos;s not me , that &apos;s the law of the &apos; will .
Ye@@ ah , you better walk away .
That was intense .
Just another Wednesday at the &apos; will .
You said to look in things , right ?

Oh , my God .
I can &apos;t believe it , it &apos;s the girl from the &apos; will .
I got your back , gir@@ -@@ r@@ -@@ r .
What is up with that ?
I don &apos;t know , man , I &apos;m just used to it .
That &apos;s what you &apos;d sound like , if you talked .
I agree with you , by the way .
Everything you say is right , Max .
Thank you , Ch@@ est@@ nut .
You should kill her .
Ch@@ est@@ nut ! I can &apos;t do that .
It &apos;ll be easy . We could kill her and eat her .
Ch@@ est@@ nut !
All right , bud@@ dy , here &apos;s your spot .
Come on , do your business .
How could there be ? !
With these constant interrup@@ tions .
I love him , but if he &apos;s broken , let &apos;s not get a new one .
What are you doing ? It &apos;s time to go .
I &apos;m not going to work today .
And would you like to know why ?
Ah , you &apos;re up@@ set because you spent the whole night working
Like a big old baby .
Call me if you need anything .
H@@ mm , it would .
Ok@@ ay , back to &quot; Em@@ ily or C@@ inn@@ am@@ on &quot; &quot;
That n@@ ag@@ ging tone is helping my an@@ xi@@ ety , y@@ e@@ ah .
But if you could maybe just go ten percent less sh@@ ri@@ ll ,
I &apos;m sorry , but you know we agreed
There you go , perfect .
Shel@@ don , stop it , I &apos;m not kid@@ ding .
Take the cap off , and put the not@@ ebook away .
But after months of strug@@ gling , I &apos;m finally making progress .
You don &apos;t need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive .
Or do I , h@@ mm ?
Sir Isaac New@@ ton wrote his Princip@@ ia

How about this ?
We &apos;ll do the jobs you already pay us for
You have a suit , right ?
Why would I pre@@ tend to be a lawyer ?
You can &apos;t even pre@@ tend to be wa@@ it@@ res@@ ses .
No one &apos;s gon@@ na believe H@@ an &apos;s our lawyer , anyway .
He can &apos;t pass the bar , he can bar@@ ely see over one .
And this area is for customers .
I want these out of here !
Max ?
I supp@@ ose I could dig up a suit if that could , somehow ,
Max , of course these girls go to Dal@@ by Hall ,
