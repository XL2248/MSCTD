Plus it &apos;s the fear of pain
Of course I &apos;m afraid of stuff .
Look ..
For practical matters ? Well , that wasn &apos;t true .
Give me a break . That &apos;s not a thing .
Everyone would rather have a boy .

The mood will border on insur@@ rection and you will be destroyed ,
The public , the Palace and the Party ins@@ ist on compliance .

Easy on the drama , D@@ ad , please .
Your mother was a good Catholic and everything ,

I bet they like E@@ vian in Fall@@ u@@ jah .
They do prefer the flat .
Junior , I don &apos;t think you have one o@@ unce of wig@@ gle room
I don &apos;t ask , they don &apos;t tell
And what would make you think that &quot; Un@@ known &quot; is a Miss ?
Hello ?
That depends who this is .
I don &apos;t do business over the phone .
How will I know who you are ?
I have a lot of people who work for me .
Of course not . Though what I can &apos;t quite figure
That is what the hotel is saying
You &apos;re a quick study .
Once the deal is made , the deal never changes .
The deal is for one passenger .
Any packages ?
Weight ?
Is that a problem ? I was told that you can transport anything
It &apos;s me . He left . You can proceed
No , it &apos;s just that it &apos;s a Ch@@ ateau Ch@@ eval Blanc from the 2005 vintage .
But it &apos;s 200 euros
Hello , Junior .
Cou@@ ple of things I need to take care of .
Ye@@ ah , I &apos;m sorry .

May I be of some assistance ?
Do you mind holding that ?

You could do that , but you &apos;d be killing your father along with us .
You don &apos;t , he dies .
Did I ever lie to you ?

Get und@@ res@@ sed
Are you asking me or telling me ?
In The Three Mus@@ k@@ ete@@ ers , there were really four .

We &apos;re gon@@ na find out . All right . Let &apos;s try .
Ok@@ ay , hold on .
Let &apos;s get the hell out of here .
Do you have any idea how to get us out of here ?
No , no , it &apos;s the main cargo hat@@ ch .
Clim@@ b in the back

Not from po@@ ison .
Look , the bul@@ let is still in there .
All right , we &apos;ve wa@@ sted enough time getting here already .

Ok@@ ay , no doctors . Let &apos;s help her ourselves .
Can you get something to raise her leg up , please .
Ok@@ ay .
All right . Take the rod off one of those clothes ra@@ cks
See how many co@@ b@@ web@@ s you can get on there .
Put some pressure on that , would you , Junior ?
No one &apos;s dying today .
How did this happen ?
It &apos;s some kind of medical grade an@@ es@@ thetic .
One part I can &apos;t quite figure out though is
We got some cons p@@ opping off .
If you can &apos;t handle it , don &apos;t cash your pay@@ check this week .
I got a call a prison@@ er was suffering from heat ex@@ haus@@ tion
I don &apos;t bl@@ ame &apos; em . It &apos;s an oven in there
When things calm down ,
And I appreciate that .
and I &apos;m just looking out for your best interests .
Or you w@@ anna get out of here ?
Well , these in@@ mates became bel@@ li@@ ger@@ ent and they refused to rack in .
We can handle 20 out-@@ of-@@ control in@@ mates easier than 300 .
A CO .
Su@@ ck it , p@@ ig !
That &apos;s right , T@@ eddy .
Hot as hell .
The call was a f@@ ake .
No no It &apos;s legally in@@ sufficient .
Good man .

A little higher and to the left
I &apos;m saving ten@@ derness is normal . No more me@@ ds .
In@@ mates in cell block have com@@ promised
It &apos;s p@@ opping off up in G Pop !
If we can get through this wall , we can get into the pipe .
No blood needs to sp@@ ill , S@@ ink .
We both know that ain &apos;t gon@@ na happen .
That &apos;s one big p@@ ile of concrete .
We &apos;ve got someone to show us where it is .
infection &apos;s not so bad .
Neg@@ ative . A-@@ W@@ ing is ev@@ acu@@ ating and locked down .
What &apos;s up , Do@@ c ?
You don &apos;t w@@ anna do this .
You ever see one of them saf@@ ari shows
T@@ ough little gor@@ illa , ain &apos;t he ?
What the hell am I supposed to do with this ?
R@@ iz@@ zo , is everything OK ?
Let the bul@@ ls worry about the noise .
How can we fit through small holes ?
Hoo@@ ke &apos;s Law of elas@@ tic@@ ity ?
If we drill holes in strategic locations ,
We &apos;ll be able to break through the part of the wall that covers the pi@@ p
It makes a kind of X .
If I can get DI@@ R@@ T in there with some of the new@@ er fire@@ power ...
Everything &apos;s been worked out so the image hits the right spot .
What if your mat@@ h is wrong ?
There &apos;ll be an explo@@ sion and we &apos;ll be burned alive .
They &apos;re breaking out .
I think we &apos;re gon@@ na go .
We were making fun of failed care@@ ers .
H@@ ey , I work at the same university you do .

Well , what he said was that he was investig@@ ating from her house .
You know , &quot; When are you coming ? &quot; I asked many times .
Um , y@@ e@@ ah , well ...
And everything about it was strange to me ,
Before you went to Japan , I saw you writing that story .
Well , so I bor@@ ro@@ wed M@@ um &apos;s key and went into your study ,
A man comes to B@@ aker Su@@ ree
&quot; The cane shows the marks of a dog &apos;s teeth .
He we@@ ars a wedding ring ?
This sentence , to be exact .
Not expensive clothes .
That &apos;s how you knew it was about the wife .
When you &apos;re a det@@ ective and a man comes to visit you ..
So why did you stop where you did ?
I told Wat@@ son , if I ever write a story myself ,
But I &apos;m trying to do so now .
&quot; So you &apos;ve come about your wife . &quot;
I &apos;ll see you after lunch .
So you found the right address .
My father &apos;s most pri@@ zed possession .
I had it brought to the house
Soon Ann asked me if she could
Mr. Hol@@ mes , my Ann has changed .
One day I was outside the room
Don &apos;t you know ?
Where are you off to ?
You &apos;ll eat your breakfast first !
She says there &apos;s a couple in Por@@ ts@@ mouth
Why would we want to live in Por@@ ts@@ mouth ?
Why not ?
Well , yes , but it would &apos;ve pleased her .
Well , I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s true .
Fla@@ y the part as he &apos;d fashi@@ oned it ,
So , Dr. Wat@@ son &apos;s imagination changed you ?
I prefer facts .
It was designed as a mini@@ ature .
The stones represent the lives of those he has lost .
I mean , do you mo@@ ur@@ n them ?
Death , gri@@ ev@@ ing , mo@@ ur@@ ning
I d@@ well on logic .
His club , the Di@@ o@@ genes ,
They were as John always described them ,
The story was familiar ,
It &apos;s strange to see a sem@@ b@@ lance of one &apos;s self 40 feet high
Wh@@ atever do you mean ?
and played
With what means have T ?
All I knew for certain was that the case was my last
Get it right before I die .
I &apos;m 93 .
Well , I didn &apos;t actually know him .
M@@ um ! M@@ um !
Was it the smoke kno@@ cked him out ?
Most likely he stood up too quickly
Well , now we can &apos;t leave .
He &apos;ll get better !
Is that clear
It &apos;s from Mr. U@@ me@@ z@@ aki .
No . W@@ an@@ ted to .
M@@ um says you throw out most of the letters you get .
The people who write want you to solve things .
Oh , no . You give me too much credit .
Perhaps Mr. U@@ me@@ z@@ aki &apos;s asking you to go back to Japan .
Why not ?
Well . If you need susp@@ ects , you know where to find me .
I bet if we asked , Mr. Hol@@ mes would .. do his thing
Let &apos;s not bo@@ ther Mr. Hol@@ mes with any f@@ oo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness .
No , that won &apos;t be necessary .
You &apos;ve been away most of the day .
In For@@ ts@@ mouth , you met the couple who run the hotel .
They made you an offer , you accepted
You compla@@ in enough about it ! Always going on about how hard things are .
She can bar@@ ely read !
Mechan@@ ic in a garage , like his dad before him .
I &apos;m gon@@ na put in for the RA@@ F &apos; &quot;
All his mates who worked the motor pool came home without a scrat@@ ch .
Don &apos;t say everything you think .
Cou@@ ldn &apos;t have . The one in the corner .
Oh , that &apos;s not my desk , it &apos;s John &apos;s .
I know you say Dr. Wat@@ son didn &apos;t always get things right ,
And the German lady . And that g@@ love .
No , that &apos;s not possible .
Well , then why was it in there ?
If you can &apos;t remember , then why couldn &apos;t the case have been a success
I chose ex@@ ile for my punishment , but what was it for ?
They &apos;re all common@@ place .
The dead are not so very far away .
Now , whenever did you say that ?
My husband could never succeed at dec@@ eption
Even before I gli@@ mp@@ sed you today ,
All these predic@@ ted your anti@@ pa@@ thy .
For@@ ging his signature ,
But for two errors .
Was that the second error
The man at the station .
St@@ on@@ em@@ ason .
The money was to pay for the head@@ stones
I was certain he wasn &apos;t .
Z@@ ou mu@@ st@@ n &apos;t do that !
He may never wake .
You didn &apos;t even have the dec@@ ency
No ! I care about Roger .
The be@@ es . didn &apos;t do it .
Roger was trying to find out what was killing the be@@ es .
He had to stop them wi@@ ping out the be@@ es .
I@@ e tried to dro@@ wn them with water from his can .
Be@@ es leave their st@@ ings . W@@ as@@ ps don &apos;t .
And when they attacked , he dropped the wat@@ ering can
A quarter of an hour &apos;s conversation .
She needed so desper@@ ately to be understood by someone
They like pun@@ chy
I &apos;m an artist .
what ?
My sweet and tal@@ ented wife !
Sweet and tal@@ ented indeed .
You &apos;ve gone and turned her stomach up@@ side down .
And before I knew it
But as the ground came up to meet me ,
And when I a@@ wo@@ ke
Sorry , Dr. Good@@ time ,
I don &apos;t mean to r@@ ush you
We can only take what &apos;s useful .
But this one &apos;s a good one .
Sk@@ ills in the theatre ..
I &apos;m telling you , it won &apos;t do a thing right !
They &apos;re mighty delicate .
You &apos;re of simple mind .
But the simple pleasure is
Oh , yes .
When things ti@@ lt off in a way they sh@@ ouldn &apos;t
And I say this line , I just look at him like , &quot; I &apos;m so sorry . &quot;
I remember Simon being very nervous to do his im@@ person@@ ation .
I supp@@ ose that could be considered offensive .
Wo@@ w ! You look like a p@@ ile of sw@@ ans .
A@@ my do you take Shel@@ don for your law@@ ful we@@ d@@ ded husband ?
And , Shel@@ don , same thing .
I was very excited by ...
What ? No , nothing .
Is that the auction catalog
What is this thing doing here ?
I do ..
How nice is this ?
We just came from lunch at Rain@@ bow Room ,
Y@@ ah , I want to be covered in gold .
Let &apos;s see . If I was a loving cup ,
How much do you think is in there ?
So I could have $ 60@@ ,000 in an hour ?
Did I say I ? How wei@@ rd .
Wo@@ w , you &apos;re getting everything .
Ar@@ en &apos;t we , Miss Pick@@ le ?
Oh , I &apos;m Max , and this is my friend K@@ ati@@ e Hol@@ mes .
But I just have to say : well done !
Oh , you have your own shop ?
Is that you and Miss Pick@@ le ?
Next item for auction :
Yes , you do !
Y@@ olo !
How much do you think this is going to go for ?
No real value ? Please .
I j@@ ump@@ ed 14 hur@@ d@@ les in the rain with walking pneum@@ onia .

Then , I &apos;m out .

she was just

The only people who don &apos;t look back with regre@@ t
T@@ aking that cl@@ erk@@ ship in Que@@ ens ?
Family ?
So , what , brothers don &apos;t count ?
But it doesn &apos;t mean I &apos;ve stopped loving you in my own way
Back , side , close , forward , quick , quick .

Ok@@ ay .
So please just tell me where he is .
Listen , where did he g@@ 0 ? Come on , this is important .
Cer@@ tain@@ ly ain &apos;t important to me .
Does it look like I need money ?
I know a pill pop@@ per when I see one . Come on .
So it &apos;s important to you .
All depends on how you hit the water .
Is it necessary for you to tor@@ ment me until the very end ?
no fu@@ cking man@@ ners ?
Now I have to jump .
No ! No ! Yes ! No , you have that !
You started y@@ elling at me !
with your doctor , Dr. F@@ iel@@ ding , ok@@ ay ?

I am an emotional h@@ ed@@ geho@@ g , but .
Ok@@ ay ? I used to love my patients !
Oh , God . No , no , please !
It al comes down to this .
both of our lives are completely ...
You gave me 90 minutes . It &apos;s not up yet .
please just take you to the hospital now ?
So I go across the street to buy a video camera from this nice guy .
And I give the video camera to a hom@@ eless guy
he decides to be a dance instruc@@ tor rather than a lawyer .
No , my son .
But what can you do ?
And when I came to , I j@@ ump@@ ed off the Brooklyn Bridge .
She j@@ umps in the East River .
I would try and figure out how to be happy .
Maybe I will .
No one expected Henry to survive one day .
That &apos;s what neighb@@ ors do , right ?
We &apos;ll tell Gab@@ y you stopped by .
There &apos;s nothing we can do .
Dear lord , we ask that you be with this young child
A@@ men .
Please extend my good wishes to Gab@@ y
Oh , Gab@@ y , thank God .

She looks lost .
Any@@ way , obviously .... .
You can@@ . send me a check .

I have nothing to hide .
Good morning .
Ah , I was up kin@@ da late .

No surprise after the way things went
Oh , I don &apos;t want to get in the middle .
Why ? You catch him , u@@ h , gr@@ ating cheese on his ab@@ s ?
M@@ ust &apos;ve been pretty bad for you
I gu@@ ess I was hop@@ ing ...
That one day I might out@@ grow all this .
I just can &apos;t have him around . He &apos;s too dist@@ rac@@ ting .
And how would that happen ?
All I know is that not living your life isn &apos;t the answer .
Well , then get good , because take my word for it ,
Cool .
U@@ h , he and Ren@@ ee went out to dinner .
Ye@@ ah . They went to that fr@@ ench restaurant dad likes .

I &apos;m also getting good at lying to my husband .
How &apos;d you find me ?
No . Your ans@@ wering service said I might find you here .
But he bought a Mas@@ er@@ ati .
very temper@@ amental ,
I &apos;m no Mas@@ er@@ ati , K@@ eit@@ h .
Well , I &apos;m sorry about that ,
And the truth is , my life &apos;s kind of a m@@ ess , too .
My house , not my life .
I really do sound like a Mas@@ er@@ ati .
Oh , my god .
The good news is ,
Do you think you can offer me that ?
Good .
But just so we &apos;re clear ,
The way things have been going l@@ ately .
You &apos;re welcome .
I think I like having you around .
It &apos;s late , isn &apos;t it ? Ye@@ ah , our truck already passed .
So@@ unds good to me .
Good to meet you too .

That is going to be Simon &apos;s office
He &apos;s like , terri@@ fied . I have to get rid of it . You want it ?
No . No
It &apos;s going to come up looking real nice . It &apos;s already great .
I should go and check on that .
Oh , I don &apos;t want to ...
Like in , you know , information protection .
don &apos;t know how to use it .
Kind of wi@@ dening out .
I want you to start re@@ building the business .
I just don &apos;t want you to be stressed , honey ,
Ok@@ ay .
Why do you get a name like Wei@@ r@@ do ?
Maybe .
Bre@@ aking in to give us something ? It &apos;s not very bright .
I hope his next gift is a s@@ ush@@ i knife for those fish .
Ha@@ -@@ ha
The fish are beautiful . Re@@ ally beautiful . Thank you .
You know , most people think that Sam@@ my Davis J@@ r. or N@@ ina Sim@@ one
Ye@@ ah .
My dad named him , actually .
I love you for it , but you know .
But he would offer an alternative , you know ?
So basically , eventually , you two need to have a conversation .
Y@@ ep .
Come on . I really don &apos;t think that is the reason why .
Why all the drop in &apos;s and the stop by &apos;s
I think you &apos;re slightly ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating .
I think he wants to nail you .
Please know that I would never do anything to up@@ set you both ,
You won &apos;t hear from me again ,
Turn it over . There &apos;s more
But he seems ok@@ ay , right ? Other than that ?
So whatever this was , let &apos;s put it behind us .
You know , what do you say ?
Simon ?
I &apos;m glad you said that , &apos; cause
I thought we left all this back in Chicago .
You got yourself a doctor too already ?
Simon , I .
He made peace with us . I think that we have to make peace with him .
&quot; C@@ ause I &apos;m not feeling good right now .
Why would he
You &apos;re probably par@@ an@@ oid from the p@@ ills .
I didn &apos;t take any .
No , I didn &apos;t take any . No , I wasn &apos;t .
This has nothing to do with p@@ ills
Will you please just listen to me ?
Rob@@ yn , it &apos;s over .
And J@@ ang@@ les .
You asked me if there &apos;s something I want to tell you .
Is there something that you w@@ anna tell me ?

That &apos;s why we &apos;ve got to just put it behind us .
It he@@ als everything .
Let &apos;s make a family .
It &apos;s really important to not look back .
Listen , so don &apos;t look now ,
Oh , my God .

I don &apos;t mean to interrup@@ t .

Gre@@ g Pier@@ son .

Once they know ? But they &apos;re not gon@@ na know .
Everything &apos;s gon@@ na be all right . It &apos;s all good .
And the camera and the al@@ arms ?
There &apos;s one camera . One alarm . There &apos;s none inside .
Because I asked the fu@@ cking secretary .

So &apos;s you can go buy a new one .
When I &apos;ve given up so much for you .
Your father for a start .
You know , I don &apos;t live my life in black and white .
You know , I am so sick of running away from who I am .
Or pleasure . In fact , why am I ap@@ ologi@@ zing for it ?
And I &apos;ve taken every drug known to man .
And all those le@@ gends who were welcoming us in .
When did you give up ?
Wh@@ enever I needed you most ,
I have worked my balls off
For years .
It &apos;s me who doesn &apos;t have a life .

That is correct .
Alphab@@ e@@ tical order , please . Come on , hur@@ ry , hur@@ ry .

We were thinking we could make something of the fact
You can probably tell from the acc@@ ent . &quot;

For Nick@@ y , I figure it was just basic mat@@ h .

The trust was gone .
And everybody went their separate ways .
And even if I couldn &apos;t , bud@@ dy , I &apos;ll tell you ,
Right .

You talk when I tell you to talk and when I don &apos;t , you do not talk .

Sh@@ ut your gig@@ gle hole
What the fu@@ ck is that ?
Well , boys , have a nice day .
Happy wife , happy life , right ? So you say .
When I was a young bu@@ ck I thought I &apos;d make history ,
They &apos;re literally nothing alike .
They grew up on different sides of the country .
That &apos;s revol@@ ting .
You never used to be that easy .
An ap@@ ology ? You sent me to prison , man .
No . You ow@@ e me five and a half
I mean , I practically ap@@ ologi@@ zed here .
Ah , man . I wish you wouldn &apos;t use that turn of phrase .
No , Pad@@ dy . I &apos;m not gon@@ na help Nick@@ y f@@ ence that painting .
So they arrest our man , put the Gospel in storage
Which means the Gospel According to James
We collect one and a h@@ al / million dollars
Let &apos;s go , boy .
Pad@@ dy &apos;s here , Nick@@ y &apos;s here
Sir , this is all about the Se@@ ur@@ at .
I need a full surveillance kit , I need man@@ power and I need a gun .
OK . No gun .
Let &apos;s take it down , you &apos;re a little test@@ y .
And let &apos;s just say , hypo@@ the@@ tically ,
A sort of &quot; Sorry for fu@@ cking you over &quot; money . Hu@@ h ?
Rob@@ in .
Maybe &apos; cause you just kno@@ cked over a nin@@ e-@@ year-old little Chinese girl .
You never pre@@ y upon the virtu@@ ous or the poor .
And you never , ever betra@@ y your family !
There &apos;s always an angle with you , man .
You think this is about money , C@@ run@@ ch ?
Think again .
Just because he says he &apos;s sorry doesn &apos;t make him a changed man .
Wo@@ w ! She &apos;s good .
No . C@@ run@@ ch needs this .
Oh . Well , what I understand is that ,
Take care .
What did ya have in mind ?
That &apos;s where the motorcycle k@@ icks in

I thought we had a 10
I &apos;ll give you an impressive number : 52
And I saw an object that ble@@ w my mind .
It was just a cup , but it was perfect .
Tur@@ ner , Mon@@ et , Ver@@ meer , those guys kept my eyes open .
I only started getting into trouble when I wanted to possess it .
Money
who you can trust .
Not because I want to get you or your brother in trouble .
Let me ask you a question .
I will
Looking good , Sam .
I &apos;m not going to fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; prison ! I &apos;m not cut out for that sh@@ it !
These wet no@@ od@@ les will prevent very few prison rap@@ es .
You got@@ ta trust me . Look , ever since I &apos;ve been back ,
OK , my turn .
All right , Gu@@ y just land@@ ed and we got a little problem .
What the fu@@ ck are you talking about ?
Because of C@@ run@@ ch &apos;s record , Inter@@ pol will be brought in .
What the hell am I looking at ?
And on the day , what about Inter@@ pol ?
Seri@@ ously , what are we doing ? Why do I listen to you ?
The border . They &apos;re at the border .

Come here . You got two lines :
Oh . Will you ?
I cannot even be in the same room as you !
I got an idea .
O@@ I . I fail to see how that makes us rich
And we can get Gu@@ y to duplic@@ ate a book for each one of them .
The news hits the paper and boo@@ m .
Each one thinks they have the original .
Well , y@@ e@@ ah , I didn &apos;t mind Pre@@ dat@@ or Two .
You can &apos;t go wrong . No .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah ! Thank you .
I &apos;m never doing this sh@@ it again !

Fu@@ ck the both of you !
He over@@ paid .
You know I &apos;m fl@@ ush . I &apos;m doing this for you .
And in five minutes we &apos;re going home .
It cost Gu@@ y ten grand to f@@ ake one .
Ten grand a book , that &apos;s a hundred grand . I can front it .
Yes , I Co .
This could have been big .
Dam@@ n it .
A million per book . Ten million bu@@ cks , guys .
No , no , no . Let &apos;s stick with ten . Let &apos;s not get gre@@ edy here .
Today . Now .
I just need money .
Oh , no , no , no , no , no .
You just made one for ten thousand .
And if you want these to pass the carbon dating and the professional sc@@ rut@@ iny ,
With our bu@@ yers , most certainly .
All right , look .
Oh , no , no , no , no , man . I &apos;m not doing that .
If we pull this off , you can buy ten of &apos; em .
Listen , I got@@ ta think about it . I w@@ anna run it by L@@ ola .
Don &apos;t talk to me about lost time , Nick@@ y .
Ah , you waste no time .
OK . Great , we &apos;re all here .
During that time period Pad@@ dy will have made the sales ,
In a month &apos;s time , we &apos;ll contact Amsterdam ,
All right .
They &apos;ll pass carbon dating , expert analysis , everything .
They &apos;ll just need to look convinc@@ ing
Why .. why bo@@ ther working that lot at all ?
This way , you and I can split it two ways
Ye@@ ah , well , let me tell you something about family .
Ye@@ ah , but then he delivers his books
I won &apos;t be around .
Fu@@ ck !
Ol@@ ga Some@@ thing
Have you ... Have you seen Pad@@ dy ?
Did you fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; see Pad@@ dy ?
What about the Gospel ? Did Cust@@ oms ask you to look at the Gospel ?
Did they ask you to look at it ?
And that is the story of the the@@ ft of the Mon@@ a Lisa .

A shoe belongs on your foot

I would let her do , but we are here ton@@ ight
One of these books is also good , but you must read loud and clear .

Unfortunately , you should know that better than most
He did not know how else to him to come off , he is ten years .

This year , there &apos;s a panel , um , on our favorite show ,
Who car@@ es ? We look great .
Just remember we left our tru@@ sty ste@@ ed in section 22@@ B .
Oh , ok@@ ay . I can write it down .
I need her to clear my day .
N@@ ope , she &apos;s out sick again .
I &apos;ve had to rescue her a b@@ unch of times
You were all the way out of the Grand Canyon
M@@ om , my din@@ osau@@ r party looks amazing !
Som@@ ebo@@ dy must &apos;ve done another din@@ osau@@ r party right next to us .
Doctor Don@@ na Dun@@ can .

H@@ ey , man . S@@ ick scale arm@@ or !
I wanted something that would go from feast to battle .
Yes !
You coming ?
That &apos;s a very , very good question ...

I &apos;m gu@@ essing my birth parents .
Sorry , was I going on too long ?
What &apos;s your question , friend ?
In that case , Mr. Log@@ an ...
They let you bring your sp@@ heres ? !
Mann@@ y ?

Wa@@ it , what ?
My favorite research institute is on the way .
Let &apos;s get him !
I was angry . I needed to take a walk
D@@ ad , I am right about this .
I know your style has always been just tough it out
A mer@@ ger &apos;s the only long-term play .

Do you think Queen Aur@@ ora &apos;s aw@@ ake yet ?
I see what you did there .
I &apos;ve sent more sp@@ rit@@ es to search the Tom@@ b Blo@@ om field .
We will keep searching until we find them .
Cr@@ ushing humans with branches is not going to help .
We all saw what Mal@@ ef@@ ic@@ ent did to him .
A cur@@ se upon our king is a cur@@ se upon this kingdom .
This is all my fault .
I &apos;m so happy to see you .
What if she never comes back ?
I have to find her .
Tell me she &apos;s dead .
She fell into the river and went over the falls .
There was something else .
It pulled her from the dep@@ ths of the sea .
Her .
A wounded animal las@@ h@@ es out and now she &apos;s not alone .
They tried to kill her with this .
It &apos;s a message from the humans .
Time for us to die .
And we are almost ext@@ inc@@ t because of it .
They &apos;ve pulled the iron from the earth ...
But this ...
Our people are safe here for now .
The humans will find us . They will not stop .
Right now !
To@@ o many k@@ ing@@ d@@ oms .
They &apos;ve destroyed it .
They &apos;re nothing but loc@@ ust@@ s that s@@ warm the earth .
You spent years car@@ ing for a human ...
Those things are a f@@ ad . In 10 years they &apos;ll be gone .
That &apos;s true .
It sm@@ ells a bit like ...
I don &apos;t know .
Do you guys know when we &apos;re gon@@ na get back ?
Oh come on . She broke the first rule .
The whole point of being here is to forget about all that sh@@ it ,
Deal with that sh@@ it when you get home .
Ok@@ ay , what as@@ sh@@ ole couldn &apos;t get on the chair right ?
Oh , that &apos;s good . Y@@ ell more .
I am so sorry about that . He can be such an as@@ sh@@ ole sometimes .

Why are you talking so fast ?
No@@ body &apos;s gon@@ na be able to understand a word you &apos;re saying .

You got@@ ta know , you can &apos;t hide looking the way you do .
There &apos;s a f@@ ake wall behind the bathroom mirror .
It &apos;s pretty ug@@ ly in there .
The body was right here .
He was dead I swe@@ ar .
There was a blue bag here with my shoes in it
And my Tas@@ er .
In fact there was a whole ca@@ che of g@@ uns ! What the hell ?
Oh , yes I have and you know with who ? Your father .
Ye@@ ah .

You &apos;re who ?
Care to tell me what you &apos;re doing here ?
Oh , and she didn &apos;t finish signing it .
P@@ ull her hair ! Now &apos;s your chance .
That check should have cle@@ ared .
Even for a little boy , by im@@ itation ,
And nobody believed , but he was like that .
We went to this place in Wales to make a competition .
Yes .
And sharing it with all my friends and with my father .

So , how did you get your first part in an opera ?
And my debut was the 29@@ th of April , 1961 ,
It &apos;s love . It &apos;s passion . It &apos;s very beautiful . It &apos;s cas@@ ual .
And desper@@ ate , because there is@@ . that is there .
I sang there in 1963 with great success .
If you want to become Luci@@ ano Pav@@ ar@@ ot@@ ti ,
You can have a beautiful , nice life of the ten@@ or ,
Everything .. Everything was easy .
It was super clear , like a phot@@ ograph .
A ten@@ or singing a high C makes your ears vibr@@ ate .
We all dre@@ amed to be the most important in the oper@@ atic world .
So I was the first boy after six years
Every@@ body was looking for me .
I think Luci@@ ano loved women . And he also trusted them .
Su@@ ddenly , in between my relationship
That was certainly an important point
Everything became more ge@@ ared towards mass appeal .
Ye@@ ah .
There &apos;s so much re@@ pertoire .
One of us suggested , &quot; Why don &apos;t you do this one and I do that ? &quot;
So , to pick , you know , between the s@@ add@@ est and so and so .
You know what kind of determination , you know what kind of fears
It was ok@@ ay , like , &quot; Any@@ thing you do , I can do better . &quot;
&quot; Boy , what a phrase you did . Now let me do this one . &quot;
It &apos;s kind of hard to over@@ state what an impact that had .
The Three Ten@@ ors transformed three guys
At the age of 60 , he sh@@ ouldn &apos;t do such things .
Di@@ vor@@ ce at that time was un@@ th@@ ink@@ able .

But my wife suffered more .
He caught it-@@ in the neck for@@ -@@ Pav@@ ar@@ ot@@ ti the pop star .
And now@@ -@@ falling in love ... ... h@@ e-@@ cau@@ gh@@ t-@@ it in the neck again .
O@@ oh . Gu@@ y must &apos;ve been a h@@ unter .

Like , just under six feet , blonde hair , kin@@ da top-@@ heavy .
Ye@@ ah , and you think that Shel@@ ly looks like her ?
Ye@@ ah .
Short with dark hair ,
U@@ h , Shel@@ ly .

And you &apos;ll always be Nick@@ y &apos;s mo@@ m .
I can just try to love the people that you love
Ok@@ ay , guys , it &apos;s getting too rough back there .
Not me . I came back to life .
Ok@@ ay , the d@@ oll@@ s are going in your back@@ p@@ acks
You &apos;ll see nothing but sm@@ iles .
Hi . I &apos;m looking for the Mc@@ Lan@@ den Foundation .
Who &apos;s this ?
I &apos;m the director of the Squ@@ aw Lake Bible Camp .
Well , we are putting together the 50@@ th anniversary
She &apos;s quite a woman , your mother .
You met my mother ?
We had a little walk down memory lane .
B@@ et you couldn &apos;t do anything right in her eyes .
But then , all the bad ideas were Fa@@ ith &apos;s , weren &apos;t they ?
For fu@@ ck &apos;s sake .
She &apos;s gotten to you , has@@ n &apos;t she ?
It &apos;s got everything to do with her .
You go alone ?
obviously , he can &apos;t really s@@ ne@@ ak around anymore , so ...
I was th@@ ink@@ in &apos; , if anyone asks about that fire at ri@@ ck &apos;s ,
I didn &apos;t start the fire .
if anyone thinks you did , it &apos;d be hand@@ y if y could prove them wrong , wouldn &apos;t it ?
I know . I just .. I can &apos;t stop now .
Well , um , as much as I appreciate this naked display of emo@@ tion ,
really ?
No . Never .
Oh , sure , you can .
I simply picture an empty box , and I take whatever I &apos;m feeling and put that in the box ,
in private , like a lady .
I &apos;m gon@@ na try that .
prove me wrong , swe@@ e@@ tie . Pro@@ ve me wrong .
Ok@@ ay , car@@ los , here &apos;s the har@@ ness .
How do I get ro@@ xy to f@@ etch it for him ?
Ro@@ xy doesn &apos;t do that .
I get that , but surely she &apos;s trained to do other stuff ,
Don &apos;t ve me your blind sar@@ cas@@ m .
Do you have one of those ?
Re@@ ally ? Well , for a dog who &apos;s supposed to help u@@ S , she sounds kind of limited .
it &apos;s not your favorite ?
Exc@@ use me . I have to put something in a box and stick it in the clos@@ et .
G@@ ot it .
U@@ h , which is why I haven &apos;t told her .
Well , when b@@ ree and or@@ son were staying with US ,
No , this was the next night .
But like I said , he was as@@ le@@ ep , so it &apos;s probably nothing .
He said .. &quot; I &apos;m sorry I ran over mi@@ ke . &quot;
He didn &apos;t even know you when that happened .
Ye@@ ah , that &apos;s what I figured .
We don &apos;t need any more drama in this house .
How &apos;s the move going ?
No , thanks . We &apos;re almost done .
Let me just run something by you .
ash@@ ys@@ ash@@ a g@@ or a call today from a couple who loved our work on the founder &apos;s ball .
Yes , and they want to hire US to do their anniversary party .
We could be . Think about it .
Well , w it &apos;s a cher@@ ished recipe from catering by ka@@ therine .
This is sh@@ am@@ eless emotional black@@ mail .
And .. it worked beautifully . I &apos;m in .
But she &apos;s been so good .
I &apos;m giving her a treat .
fine . One treat .
So I gu@@ ess that means you won &apos;t be getting your hair done anymore .
Just picture the middle one all by itself .
but since you love her so much , I &apos;m gon@@ na keep looking .
I &apos;m not sure .
Oh , that &apos;@@ S ...
It &apos;s just that I have so many questions , and ...
And we &apos;d keep this from your mo@@ m ?
u@@ h , I think we might be out of cand@@ les .
R@@ ick .
Ok@@ ay .
You see ? I can talk slow , too .
Oh , I think you were busy at the time ... kid@@ n@@ apping his guide dog .
Don &apos;t judge me .
We &apos;re fine .
This is our relationship .
Not that much . Just his eyes .
We have to move .
I know this is difficult ,
Trust me , he &apos;s already been there .
He should pay for what he did .
How come d@@ ad@@ dy &apos;s sleeping on the couch again ?
Come on .
M@@ omm@@ y and d@@ ad@@ dy are son@@ t of ... fighting ,
Oh , something he did that made m@@ omm@@ y really mad .
Yes , of course .
We heard d@@ ad@@ dy say that man wanted to take you away from US .
It &apos;s to always bring it .
And when did you leave Hong Kong ?
It had gotten a little difficult with the police on one side
He got into so many street f@@ ights that by 18 ,
To go when you &apos;re still a star is very strange ,
He didn &apos;t ever look at people
Tak@@ y K@@ im@@ ura was really his best friend .
He was five years older than we were ,
We both attended the University of Washington .
And then when we were both done with our classes ,
In the rest of the country there were no inter@@ racial mar@@ ri@@ ages .
My mother was not thri@@ lled when we decided to get married ,
That didn &apos;t mean the ban lifted in people &apos;s hearts .
The bigger guy equally
He would just put it down no matter how big you were .
Whether Bruce Lee was a great fighter or wasn &apos;t a great fighter
I made that as a jo@@ ke , of course .
Every time I said it at that time ,
As a k@@ id , we wat@@ ched Green Hor@@ net for him .
He had a fly car , I &apos;ll give him pro@@ ps for the car ,
A lot of st@@ unt guys didn &apos;t know
With him , it &apos;s boo@@ m , boo@@ m , boo@@ m , boo@@ m ,
Th@@ ats something I can really
The beauty was that he immediately said ,
Re@@ ally ? You didn &apos;t like yourself ? I didn &apos;t see it .
Mar@@ tial art has a very ,
He really did read
He had a huge library of
As an actor , as a mar@@ tial artist , as a human being ,
And you can take most of the pass@@ ages from that book
Was how can I most efficiently
The other stuff was Hollywood .
Do you understand ?
And that &apos;s not to say that it can &apos;t be passed on .
Our main event , for the light heav@@ y@@ weight title ,
How does it differ from , say , our kind of bo@@ xing ?
Second to none .
Oh ! Beautiful el@@ bow !
You name it , man , we use it .
I mean the .. everything , I mean , not just the hand .
There &apos;s no debate .
I do think ther &apos;s a cor@@ relation there ,
In 1963 you &apos;ll see Gene
And he was out , like ,
I &apos;d throw him and fli@@ p him and
And he was a magnificent ath@@ l@@ ete .
He &apos;s before anyone else .
That bo@@ thers me .
And if you don &apos;t believe me , I &apos;ll cho@@ ke you
People get p@@ is@@ sed off and bom@@ bed out and everything else .
He was so directed and
&quot; The right p@@ unch comes .
Y@@ our@@ self ?
And did that part , just expressed myself like I say
Was he too ?
You &apos;ve had everybody as your student .
I don &apos;t know if you remember them .
I said . This IS what it is OK
Now , you put water into a cup
You put it in a te@@ ap@@ ot , it becomes the te@@ ap@@ ot .
Be water , my friend .
Bruce Lee plays a work@@ ing-@@ class hero .
But at the same time as that , he &apos;s never one of the guys .
Bruce Lee completely changed
It &apos;s a bal@@ let . In terms of
They cho@@ p &apos; em up so much .
I was living in Miami when they came out .
I would spend hours whi@@ pping
It became like a household product .
After I wat@@ ched this movie , I used to use that .
Right out of the gate I sw@@ ung
And after that I stopped making the noise
I got into it because I stopped carrying a gun .
I &apos;m not ash@@ amed to admit it .
This one particularly is sen@@ tim@@ ental for me .
He wants to put a little more
And he was ad@@ am@@ ant he was not going to the set .
He could lose his temp@@ er .
Lin@@ da was that f@@ abul@@ ous wife .
I was talking behind the
Let me think .
And they &apos;re all better off , the world is better off ,
Enter the Dragon was Hollywood &apos;s first di@@ pping its toe
The opening scene , Bruce Lee
I haven &apos;t seen any actor in an action film
Dest@@ ro@@ y the image and you will break the enemy .
This is the moment that he was waiting for .
Bruce was in a studio doing du@@ b@@ bing for Enter the Dragon
And he was un@@ conscious and I was talking to him ,
T@@ ed W@@ ong used to always tell me ,
He had just had a collapse .
He told me that he &apos;d had an OK from U@@ CL@@ A that his body was fit .
Bruce Lee faces a real di@@ lem@@ ma .
So what does he chose , the East or the West ?
I was called and told by Ray@@ mond Ch@@ ow ,
Everything took too long a time .
And I remember turning to
The business made us destroy it .
Ye@@ ah . We found some in a truck
Truck &apos;s mani@@ fest led us here .
Company sends us all kinds of material to sh@@ red .
H@@ ey , som@@ ebo@@ dy has to lose the Super Bow@@ l , right ?
Maybe someone fell in .
Not to mention O@@ SH@@ A .
You &apos;re gon@@ na have to shut it down right now , b@@ oss .
We want to talk to everybody who worked that night shift .
H@@ ey , got one right here .
Exc@@ ept for the big stuff ,
That &apos;s it ; that &apos;s the whole grav@@ ey@@ ard shift .
Well , maybe they didn &apos;t have to .
All this came from the one truck with the body parts ?
Did you really sign up for this ?
Still got W@@ endy on your mind , hu@@ h ?
Belie@@ ve me , I get it .
Good night out on the town .
When ?
I got &quot; Yu@@ ck . &quot;
Som@@ ebo@@ dy &apos;s in a good mood .
You have a ... certain g@@ low .
Det@@ ective V@@ art@@ ann &apos;s a good man .
I , u@@ h , sent representative samples to DNA .
Ob@@ viously , the body &apos;s too man@@ g@@ led
I took a tissue sample .
I &apos;ll give you a tour .
Are you thinking entry wo@@ und ?
Bul@@ let fra@@ g .
Gre@@ g found bul@@ let frag@@ ments
You know this guy ?
Hav@@ en &apos;t you &apos;ve seen his online ads ?
I just signed up last month .
Every aspect of our life has been reduced
My name is Lar@@ ry La@@ Mot@@ te , and I want to ask you a question .
You &apos;re Lar@@ ry La@@ Mot@@ te ?
Now , did I hear you gentlemen correctly ?
You look younger on TV .
Marketing 101 .
And who is the man in front of the camera ?
Ye@@ ah , he can &apos;t string two sent@@ ences together ,
Well , as I was , u@@ h , telling Mr. Kap@@ lan ,
The credit cards were in your name .
Hell , they even re@@ poss@@ essed my truck
Six of &apos; em .
You running the credit card
On the computer in the bul@@ l@@ pen .
I &apos;m checking my purch@@ ases .
I can &apos;t believe that I trusted those guys .
It &apos;s like that friend that you meet in science camp ,
And then he starts showing you this sk@@ et@@ ch@@ book ,
It &apos;s not the same .
Right , but could still come from the same victim .
A previous incident .
Over time , the body &apos;s defense mechanism
Maybe this sh@@ red of evidence will help .
Car@@ tri@@ dge case from the shooting .
No , the only good thing about a case going cold is
Ok@@ ay , so we &apos;ve got two sho@@ ot@@ ings , six years apart .
There &apos;s got to be a connection somehow .
Then someone k@@ ills Julius Kap@@ lan ,
C@@ ould be .
Sh@@ red@@ der Gu@@ y had a credit card
Right .
Maybe he wanted Lar@@ ry La@@ Mot@@ te to know he was in town .
I mean , Julius Kap@@ lan said it himself .
Well , he might be , if the th@@ ief is threat@@ ening
DM@@ V in Florida
Well , if he &apos;s Lar@@ ry La@@ Mot@@ te ,
We pulled a si@@ x-@@ year-old print off it .
You have a very impressive C@@ V .
Good@@ b@@ ye , Lar@@ ry La@@ Mot@@ te .
Ar@@ lo Kar@@ den doesn &apos;t have the same ring to it , I &apos;ll give you that .
Information is currency .
And you turned it into cold , hard cash .
Kno@@ ws every phone call ,
You knew about the black@@ mail .
You even knew
The thing about the &quot; qu@@ o &quot; is ,
And the &quot; qu@@ id pro qu@@ o &quot; started a long time ago .
&quot; Hon@@ ey , can you gra@@ b me a cup of coffee &quot; ?
&quot; Swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ t ,
We spoke with Lee Dev@@ ries .
You used his identity to rent a get@@ away car
naturally , we &apos;d be looking for Dev@@ ries and not for you .
1@@ L@@ L 11@@ 11
She calls it &quot; The bos@@ om &apos;s welcome m@@ at . &quot;
No . This is just to give you ideas .
I mean , do you want a train ?
Not the kind of trains you like .
The kind on the back of a wedding dress ?
But while we &apos;re on the subject of fashion ,
M@@ m . Well , I &apos;ve got a push@@ -up bra I can loan you
$ 500 million .
What do you need that kind of money for ?
I just need 2,@@ 14@@ 8 high-@@ power las@@ ers
Shel@@ don , they &apos;re not gon@@ na give you half a billion dollars .
No . Sh@@ h .
Well , it &apos;s too much money , you can &apos;t ask for that all at once .
Ok@@ ay . What if you asked for $ 20 million ?
We have a deal ?
No . That &apos;s only a two letter word .
Well , I &apos;m sorry , Shel@@ don , but this sort of thing happens .
50 years ?
You just have to wait for science to catch up
You know what they say :
Oh , don &apos;t be sil@@ ly .
Just be gentle .
You don &apos;t seem like you really want to sell these .
These are all important to me ,
Is it ok@@ ay if I stand here and watch ?
If anyone asks , tell them I was bra@@ ve .
I know , right ? That was crazy .
Do you know how that makes me look ?
Right ? !
and I even used the perf@@ ume he gave me in fifth grade ,
It &apos;s the most beautiful gest@@ ure I have ever seen .
The horn doesn &apos;t help , does it ?
But I can &apos;t decide between m@@ ate or s@@ atin .
We decided against eg@@ g@@ shell .
Why don &apos;t we just paint the floor eg@@ g@@ shell
She brought that fro@@ g back to life !
T-@@ They &apos;re sug@@ gest@@ ing that she ski@@ p fifth grade
We &apos;re not char@@ ting out the next 20 years of her life .
If we don &apos;t do this right ,
I &apos;m just saying
Luke &apos;s first hair@@ cut .
Well , that &apos;s it .
You remember when he hi@@ d that mouse tra@@ p under the pil@@ low
Ye@@ ah , so maybe sp@@ las@@ h some cold water on your face
My name is Luke Dun@@ phy
That &apos;s what he said when I was the ti@@ ck@@ le monster !
Well , I gu@@ ess you can &apos;t have cake today .
Cla@@ ire , I gu@@ ess I &apos;m pic@@ king up the cake myself ,
This is my new friend , Charlie .
He sm@@ ells so good !
What is going on ?
I know . It happens so fast .
Today he gave us a Roll@@ s-@@ Roy@@ ce .
I thought I was gon@@ na be able to meet Mr. Bur@@ t Re@@ yn@@ ol@@ ds !
The one time that I thought
I &apos;m gon@@ na kill him !
Oh , yes . This is it . This is the one .
The lunch scene in a strip joint
Maybe one where we just sat at a table .
Un@@ less you want to ski@@ p all that
I learned how to shoot a gun when I was eight .
l had night@@ mar@@ es about the bas@@ ement .
I &apos;ve spent my entire life trying to get over the par@@ ano@@ ia
Ye@@ ah , that quar@@ ter@@ back thing is all mess@@ ed up .
What is she gon@@ na do with herself ?
She &apos;ll be all right .
Why do we have to come out again ?
What ? You don &apos;@@ t. you don &apos;t enjoy it ?
But h@@ ey .

You des@@ erve better .
All@@ y@@ son , you &apos;re the cool@@ est , you &apos;re the pret@@ ti@@ est ,
Thank you .
Let &apos;s get out of here .
From a clinical perspective ,
They can grow acc@@ ustom@@ ed to always being afraid ,
But there &apos;s also the other side .
We do one more hit , we have the cash to get started .
Jesus , let &apos;s fu@@ cking go .
Let &apos;s just get it over with .
Open the fu@@ cking safe !
This is Agent Mart@@ ine@@ z requ@@ esting immediate backup
But your kids ?
That &apos;s the right move , you putting your kids first .
I didn &apos;t put them first . I did this for me .
Th@@ an@@ king you . Th@@ an@@ king some man holding the door .
Th@@ an@@ king Jim@@ my .
And with all that , I never walked a day on the streets
It &apos;ll be a cold day in hell before that
I was just about to make my decision
A clos@@ et doesn &apos;t get installed in this town
It &apos;s all about the songs .
Wh@@ atever it is , it needs to be truth .
Bro@@ ther , I write love songs , to God .
Sometimes to a girl .
So , y@@ e@@ ah .
Ye@@ ah
But to be honest with you ...
But I have to believe there &apos;s a reason .
it Will all be worth it .
You &apos;re so good at it .
In one story . God grants healing
Because each is a chapter in a bigger story .
Each is the light of one star helping to form a galax@@ y .
I had my mi@@ racle .
It was enough
Even when we can &apos;t see .
All right , just this once you may close the door .
Oh , dam@@ n it .
Pri@@ ya , this is your brother .
Would you be sleeping over again this evening ?
Actually , he can .
If a woman &apos;s father is not around ,
There it is , Pri@@ ya . We &apos;re Indian .
My point is , you can &apos;t go out with Leon@@ ard .
My sister .
It &apos;s very nice to meet you .
Your former boy@@ friend has replaced you
Oh . Well , good for him .

I don &apos;t make mistakes .
Get the fu@@ ck out of my house .
My old man . I don &apos;t even know what just happened .
Let me talk to him , all right ? I &apos;ll get it all figured out .
You know what happens if you don &apos;t have it .
What the fu@@ ck was that ?
That &apos;s not our business , D@@ anny .
What &apos;s the problem , D@@ anny ?
is when am I gon@@ na pull my weight .
Ye@@ ah .
som@@ ebo@@ dy made me the same proposal .
The problem was , everybody got h@@ ook@@ ed on the sh@@ it .
I had to kill people I loved because I couldn &apos;t trust them .
Pop , made promises to these people .
&quot; 70 . We en@@ listed that fall
you know , what was that red@@ head &apos;s name ?
b@@ am , she sm@@ acked her head right on that thing , kno@@ cked herself out .

Let the roots be my senses .
Let the land be my eyes and ears .
Find the one who drew it .
The sword must be mine . The king must die .
Find the new king .
A YouTube thing . A social experiment .
Look .
Put it into Google Translate .
Pay attention , everybody .
Why don &apos;t you introduce yourself ?
We don &apos;t know you , and we don &apos;t want to know you .
Good people ,
Who will kne@@ el at his feet and swe@@ ar alle@@ gi@@ ance ?
But R@@ ok@@ as saw it with his own eyes .
F@@ allen war@@ ri@@ ors from batt@@ les of old .
For now , they can only enter this realm after dark .

Or when every risen war@@ ri@@ or ...
That &apos;s why my m@@ um disappeared .
There are three mo@@ ons until the solar ec@@ lip@@ se

She is gre@@ ed , enti@@ t@@ lement ,
That &apos;s why her strength returns .
And I &apos;m supposed to stop her ?
I &apos;m not even old enough to do a paper round .
It &apos;s too dangerous , we &apos;ll die .
It &apos;s been great to meet you , and good luck with everything .
There is no turning back .
De@@ fe@@ at M@@ organ@@ a in her own realm
Christmas Day , that was exhau@@ sting .
Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God . Oh , my God .

Don &apos;t talk to us . We &apos;re only here for the f@@ ights .

Hi , Bl@@ u !
We &apos;re not the only ones .
I thought we were alone .
Of course not .
How amazing would that be ?

We have to get out into the wild and be birds , Bl@@ u .
Come on , Bl@@ u , what do you say ?
He didn &apos;t say &quot; no . &quot;
We &apos;re going to the Amazon !
The Amazon is one of Earth &apos;s most end@@ anger@@ ed ecos@@ ystems ..

You &apos;re looking at the next King of Car@@ nival !
Walk it off , bud@@ dy !

As you know , my friends , this log@@ ging operation is a little .
If those two nuts find those birds , we &apos;re out of business .
Find them and get rid of them .
But as you can see , we have found sanc@@ tuary .
Everyone ! Come on ! Everyone , out of your ne@@ sts !
Come on , birds . My Je@@ wel is back !
Make way . Make way ! Je@@ wel !

And no human things in the jung@@ le . Under@@ stood ?
I feel naked
You know what I &apos;m saying ?
Besides , our whole family couldn &apos;t possibly fit in your bach@@ el@@ or pad
Wo@@ w . This is incredible .
With my own two wings , of course .
This is a f@@ anny pack .
I &apos;ll meet you by the clay banks .
He doesn &apos;t actually think we &apos;re moving to the jung@@ le , does he ?
Let &apos;s not ru@@ in the moment , ok@@ ay ?
All right , you win . I will leave the f@@ anny pack behind .
Fa@@ ve fun .

Ok@@ ay , Bob , whatever . Show us what you got .
Did you think I &apos;d cr@@ um@@ ble ?
Did you think I &apos;d lay down and die ?
Everyone from the village is coming . It &apos;s gon@@ na be off the charts .
It &apos;s the perfect plan .
Go away .

Ok@@ ay . Love you .
En@@ ough with that GPS , really .
No , no . H@@ ang on . I just found Lin@@ da and Tu@@ lio &apos;s coordinates .
They can help keep this place safe .
my dad knows what he &apos;s doing
Route guidance complete .
Maybe they should just be left alone .
Help Lin@@ da and Tu@@ lio find the flo@@ ck and get home .
And her father ? A total nut job .
He loves them . He &apos;s a pet !
He called me a pet .
It &apos;s like he thinks I &apos;m the enemy or something .

Girls , show m@@ omm@@ y how sad we &apos;d be
D@@ ad@@ dy , you w@@ anna see him do a tri@@ ck ?
Now come back .
Is that a gun in your pocket ,
You &apos;ve got a gun in your pocket ?
Why do you have a gun ?
I don &apos;t ... I don &apos;t know if I could do that .
And the chem@@ o &apos;s just k@@ icking my ass .
Please help me go the way@@ I want to .
Sorry to keep you waiting , Mr. And Mrs. Del@@ fin@@ o .
He does .
The guy was breaking into our neighb@@ or &apos;s house .
Oh , honey .
I don &apos;t know .
Well , you &apos;re the b@@ oss .
Buy a new x@@ ero@@ x machine
What are you doing ?
You &apos;re inv@@ ading every photo that Penn@@ y and I are in .
And we &apos;re back to this .
I &apos;m just trying to for@@ ge a relationship with Penn@@ y .
You &apos;re just some woman her father is ..
&quot; Well , &quot; What ?
That &apos;s not all I am .
You know , you should probably talk to Tom .
What is it ?
I thought you understood everything .
I speci@@ alise .
What &apos;s so important about five bor@@ ing mur@@ ders ?
Yes , si@@ r . Did you not know that , si@@ r ?
Not unlike yourself ... si@@ r .
Oh , I wasn &apos;t being critical .
Five ? We thought three ,
As ever , you see but you do not observe .
A bet ? !
That &apos;s a risk you &apos;ll have to take .
Why not ? It &apos;s so much more exciting than gam@@ bling with others &apos; .
Rest assured , it has features of interest .
You really do .
A dead woman walking the earth .
I do ?
Perhaps since I convinced the reading public that
You may , however , rest assured there are no gh@@ o@@ sts in this world .
Sorry , what did you say ?
I thought you were a doctor !
Inclu@@ ding the contents of the en@@ vel@@ ope you received ?
I assume she was capable of finding a reason .
Ric@@ ol@@ etti ?
I &apos;ve never heard of her .
We &apos;ll show ourselves out . I hope to see you again in the morning .
Then s@@ adly I shall be solving your murder . Good day .
Will you see that Lady Car@@ m@@ ich@@ ael receives this . Thank you .
Cer@@ tain@@ ly , si@@ r .
Lady Car@@ m@@ ich@@ ael will sleep alone ton@@ ight ,
You think the spec@@ tre , er , Bri@@ de ,
Gu@@ ilt is eating away at his soul .
Some@@ thing in his past . The orange pi@@ ps were a remin@@ der .
Not at all .
Sir Eu@@ st@@ ace knows this only too well ,
I pres@@ ume .
They are the sh@@ adows that define our every sunny day .
There &apos;s something more than murder he fears .
No . You think so . I could tell .
Yes , you have .
Oh , why not ?
Hol@@ mes , against absolutely no opposition wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever ,
I am currently attemp@@ ting to have a perfectly
Why do you need to be alone ?
Sorry ?
I said the mur@@ derer DI@@ D leave a note .
I dun@@ no , I just sort of do .
Which is strange , because he likes that bit .
I &apos;m sure he was ex@@ ag@@ ger@@ ating .
Ob@@ viously , I &apos;ve returned the cour@@ tes@@ y .
They smell so ...
I &apos;m sure you acquain@@ ted yourself with them before now .
Tell me , does the illustr@@ ator travel with you ?
I &apos;m aware of all six occasions you have visited these apartments
Because doesn &apos;t this remind you of another case ?
There &apos;s nothing new under the sun . What was it ?
Do you remember ?
I &apos;m sorry ?
Well , I &apos;ll tell you what , that rather b@@ lows the co@@ b@@ web@@ s away .
How do I look ?
You ble@@ w your own bra@@ ins out , how could you survive ?
I have to go back !
I was ... I was nearly there , I nearly had it !
Go back where ? You didn &apos;t get very far .
Lo@@ dged in my hard drive ,
S@@ hot herself in the head , exactly like M@@ ori@@ ar@@ ty .
We &apos;ve only just found out ,
What progress have you made ? What have you been doing ?
I &apos;ve been in my M@@ ind Palace , of course .
R@@ unn@@ in@@ q an experiment . How would I have solved the crime ,
I had all the details perfect .
No , he can do this , I &apos;ve seen it .
Yes , and I need to get back there .
Maybe there are one or two things that I know that you don &apos;t .
Did you make a list ?
That wa@@ ist@@ coat is clearly new@@ er than the jacket .
Of what ?
No , it &apos;s not that , he goes into a sort of tran@@ ce .
We have an agreement , my brother and I , ever since that day .
I alle@@ vi@@ ate bor@@ e@@ dom and
You could die !
Oh , I supp@@ ose we should .
Y@@ ep , that &apos;s where I &apos;m looking .
I think it would be a good idea .
C@@ ould you all just shut up for five minutes !
I was nearly there before
Sher@@ lock , listen to me .
Hol@@ mes , how could you ?
It seemed obvious to me
Help from her friends .
I was talking to Mary .
He likes to keep an eye on his mad si@@ bling .
Of course it has@@ n &apos;t ,
Only now , I &apos;m afraid .
Time I sp@@ ed up . En@@ ough ch@@ atter , let &apos;s concentrate .
What do they want to ac@@ comp@@ lish ?
This time , should anyone attempt to identify her ,
Die to prove a point ?
Every war has suicide missions and make no mistake , this is war .
The invisible army ho@@ ver@@ ing at our el@@ bow ,
But an army non@@ etheless ,
So you see , Wat@@ son , My@@ cro@@ ft was right .
She was dying .
E@@ mel@@ ia Ric@@ ol@@ etti .
So she decided to make her death count .
Ho@@ oper !
For the record , Hol@@ mes , she didn &apos;t have me fo@@ ol@@ ed .
That would take weeks to find , if those records even exists .
G@@ ot it .
I need to know I was right , then I &apos;ll be sure .
Yes .
My investigation was the fant@@ asy ,
I need to try !
The cor@@ p@@ se they sub@@ stit@@ uted for her after the so-called suicide ?
But where ?
But that .. that &apos;s exactly what they must have done .
They found a body ,
It &apos;s why we came here . I need to know .
This is important to me !
John ...
We have a case , we have a real-@@ life problem right now .
Just let me do this .
That &apos;s how you got in this state !
I &apos;m not playing this time , Sher@@ lock . Not any more !
I &apos;m taking Mary home .
More than likely .
We do have slightly more pressing matters to hand , little brother .
Fans , we &apos;re gon@@ na go now to the Ri@@ din &apos; Dir@@ ty bu@@ cking ch@@ ute ..
Go , u@@ ke !
For over a year , an injury has si@@ del@@ ined him .
He has a long way to go .
We &apos;ll see .
Ye@@ ah , go !
H@@ ey , Lar@@ ry .

Nice to meet you , Sop@@ hia .
You were the big winner ton@@ ight , right ?
Oh , no . Do@@ esn &apos;t work like that where I &apos;m from .
You &apos;re buying
I &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
You really should eat something
How do you know about R@@ uth ?
What do you care ?
I am a total failure .
Father thinks that art stopped with M@@ atis@@ se and Pic@@ asso .
You try and raise your children right , I@@ ra ...
Very good . Very good .
It was nice seeing you talk like that .
H@@ ey , R@@ uth . I need to ask you something .
I &apos;ve always wanted one since I was a little girl .
I feel this need , this responsibility ,
You can ask me now
If you mar@@ ry me , you may never have a family .
The war was over .
We &apos;re closed !
You cannot tell me what I &apos;m willing to give up !
I was here , cl@@ ing@@ ing to the hope ..
Yes , and have kids . But that &apos;s a dream , I@@ ra .
Un@@ less you don &apos;t love me anymore .
a chance at life together
He sure has been through a lot .
IL@@ ul@@ ke .
What are you doing right now ?
Everyone was always scre@@ aming in wei@@ rd languages .
My p@@ ants were too short always .
Gro@@ wing up on a cattle ran@@ ch , everybody I knew was the same .
I &apos;m je@@ al@@ ous .
I wanted to be like everyone else when I was little
I think before I met you , the closest thing I came to cattle was
You said you love the house , right ?
Do@@ esn &apos;t look like anyone &apos;s home .
Ye@@ ah , and which one are you ?
What are you doing ?
I &apos;d love to . This is the most important thing to me .
This is Adri@@ enne Francis
Nice to meet you , Luke .
No , never made it to college .
No , I can &apos;t say that I am .
Hon@@ est@@ ly ?
think there &apos;s more bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it here than where I work
Why can &apos;t you try to fit into mine ?
It was a jo@@ ke , ok@@ ay ? She thought it was funny .
What if she was just trying to be poli@@ te ?
W@@ ha@@ c ?
Do you really see yourself living on a ran@@ ch ?
And what am I gon@@ na do ?
Go out with your artist friends ? Go to br@@ unch ?
There &apos;s nothing we can do .
I did , and that &apos;s what he said
There must be something more we can do .
You be good . Ok@@ ay , p@@ al ?
Maybe I &apos;ll raise ch@@ ick@@ ens ..
If that &apos;s what you want .
Any@@ thing at all . A far@@ mer , a lawyer , an astronom@@ er .
And who knows what they would &apos;ve done to Daniel .
R@@ uth , you are my family .
We never saw Daniel again .
Oh , sh@@ it .
The b@@ ull fighter &apos;s taking the b@@ ull away in the other direction .
Let me get him something to make him feel a little bit better .
26@@ 4 on three bul@@ ls !
T@@ e &apos;s a@@ wesome .
Ok@@ ay . Got@@ ta go .
I know !
H@@ ey , babe . I &apos;m walking to the taxi right now .
Hi , Lu@@ iz . Some@@ thing &apos;s happened to Luke .
Um , I need to see my boy@@ friend , Luke Coll@@ ins .
Ok@@ ay . Can I at least know how he is ?
He took a pretty hard fall .
I &apos;ll let you know .
So , are you ligh@@ t-@@ headed , di@@ zz@@ y ?
I &apos;d like you to stay overnight for observation .
I came as soon as I heard
should be here .
Ye@@ ah , me , too .
Oh , really ?
Look , Sop@@ hia .
but you &apos;re going to have to figure out for yourself what that &apos;s going to be .
I think you should go .
Even if that happiness no longer includes me .
Always .
We focused on celeb@@ rating all the wonderful things we had
Ru@@ th@@ ie
The paintings R@@ uth and I had collected
Can I help you ?
Dam@@ iel Mc@@ Donald
That was six years ago .
Thank you .
Physics and astronom@@ y at the University College London .
I moved back to the States a few years ago .
I knew I had to bring you this .
You did everything you could with Luke , Sop@@ hia .
If we don &apos;t have this place , where are you gon@@ na go ?
You &apos;re doing this for yourself .
That &apos;s all it is .
U@@ h , yes . This is she .
I &apos;ve been trying to reach you .
I &apos;m sorry , Ms. Dank@@ o .

Luke , you will have the num@@ ber-@@ one con@@ tender ..
He is doing one of the most difficult things in sports ..
Ye@@ ah , but Ju@@ ke Coll@@ ins , he is on P@@ B@@ P fire !
You got it ! Keep riding !
H@@ ey , Luke , you made the eight on R@@ ango .
One hell of a ride , son , I tell you !

Now , Tr@@ a &apos;s will is very detailed
specifically for the occasion .
My beloved R@@ uth .
And sharing that happiness ...
We celebrated , we achieved
We &apos;ll start the bi@@ dding at $ 1,000 for Portrait of R@@ uth .
Who has $ 1,000 for me ?
Just $ 600 , fol@@ ks .
That car down there has moved so much .
And then it was like shipped , like , here .
Ye@@ ah , exactly .

Why ? Why are you cr@@ ying ?

D@@ aff@@ y Du@@ ck

Get your hands in the air .
God , it &apos;s Mike .
We lost two assets attemp@@ ting to neutr@@ alize Wis@@ em@@ an-@@ design@@ ate How@@ ell .
He was armed with a spo@@ on , si@@ r .
We &apos;re not sure yet , the exact nature of the confron@@ tation ..
I know that , Pho@@ e@@ be .
Pho@@ e@@ be . It doesn &apos;t even make any sense to me .
Ye@@ ah .
Ok@@ ay , so she said ...
So maybe just try and remember and focus and put it together .
What did the lady say ?
You &apos;re his ma@@ id . You &apos;re his land@@ lady .
It was just a thing .
No , I don &apos;t want to get ... No .
He can hel@@ o us hide out and I &apos;m still in hand@@ cu@@ ff .
Re@@ ally ? Well , who is , all right ?
Like , and if someone who &apos;s trying to kill you , goes , &quot; Wa@@ it .. &quot;
No . I &apos;m just starting to fre@@ ak out .
I just think that maybe we need to figure out what the fu@@ ck we &apos;re doing
And nothing else is going to happen , I promise .
Why would you .. I should not be talking .
Oh , my God . There &apos;s an empty field .
Ye@@ ah , but how do you know ?
I know . I know , babe .
It &apos;s a type of tank .
Can we come over ?
Get inside right now , man !
I ain &apos;t tr@@ y@@ in &apos; to die from no mon@@ key disease . Come on , get inside !
We recovered him from the sh@@ eri@@ ff station 30 minutes ago .
He took my teeth .
Ye@@ ah , so why do you come to my house , Mike ?
Cra@@ zy is as crazy does and you dra@@ gged crazy here .
You see what I &apos;m saying ?
We just thought it would be , like , saf@@ er here .

The bridge into town has been blocked with access in or out of the town ....
That &apos;s not real . That can &apos;t .
Pho@@ e@@ be . No , Pho@@ e@@ be , stop .
I think we should just wait here .
You &apos;ll see . He &apos;s just a sensitive and complex man .
Just give me one second .
What do you mean , Qu@@ in@@ zin , I can &apos;t be in your league ?
It &apos;s too late , man .

Can you tell me your name ?
Welcome back , si@@ r .
You think he &apos;s gon@@ na make it ?
He really has to make it .
There &apos;s gon@@ na be too much tension .
Can I ask a question about that ?
And now you &apos;re embar@@ rass@@ ed

He joined the army . Yes , Im in .
Why are you trying to stop him ?
And ?
But why would you want to stop him ?
Don &apos;t you think that &apos;s a problem ?
A@@ wesome ?
What , he &apos;s got a drinking problem now ?
He &apos;s that guy who gets killed cleaning his own gun .
You are going to use logic and reason
And if all of that doesn &apos;t work , K@@ are@@ v , you &apos;re gon@@ na pull out
Do you think he has a shot ?
I &apos;m on my way Have you talked to B@@ ail@@ ey

She needs rest .
Well , she &apos;s not gon@@ na he@@ al
No , she &apos;s my patient . I don &apos;t care if you &apos;re her husband .
No , really ?
Maybe we can go do that first and then go get married after ?
I &apos;ll have n@@ el@@ son do it .
We &apos;ll run to city hall , we &apos;ll come back . And we &apos;ll do it then .
No , you know , let &apos;s go . We got@@ ta go

Pass@@ enger train .
I &apos;m going to have to catch the 6 : 30 departure .
I got to go .
Try and get a little sleep .
Well , dream of me .
The bom@@ b went off just moments after the comm@@ uters bo@@ arded .
The death toll is at 144 and still rising .
And all signs point to terrorist leader Matthias
The workers of The Col@@ ony des@@ erve equality .
And with over@@ population figures in the U@@ . F.@@ B. continuing to rise ,
Federal police have since attri@@ buted that bom@@ bing to this man , Carl Haus@@ er ,
Go@@ ing somewhere ? No ?

At Rek@@ all , we &apos;ll provide you

Please prepare for grav@@ ity re@@ vers@@ al .
L@@ ooks like that bom@@ b set off a hell of a pan@@ ic up here .
All factory personnel must enter through security gate 12 .
That mind
Do yourself a favor , Dou@@ g , stay away from them .
Remember Trav@@ is from shift three ?
Ye@@ ah , I do .
I don &apos;t need to think about it .
It ain &apos;t worth it .
Maybe I need my mind mess@@ ed with .
Don &apos;t bl@@ ame me .
I don &apos;t want to be here any longer than you do , ok@@ ay ?
So take all your complaints to Chancellor Co@@ ha@@ agen .
Come on .
I trained the last guy you fired .
What are you talking about ?
Your memory was er@@ ased , your mind was im@@ planted
There is no Douglas Qu@@ aid , there never was .
This ..
Deep down , did you really believe
How would I know ?
Qu@@ aid must &apos;ve known we &apos;d be tracking it .
Oh , sh@@ it .
He &apos;d had major tac@@ tical training , si@@ r .
How the hell did he get activated ?
been blow@@ n before they could get to him .
It means , it means they succeeded in giving you
You have to believe me .
Get to my apartment !
Lo@@ yal
Now , what to do with you ?
Leave her out of this . I &apos;m in the fu@@ cking chair !
Let &apos;s take extra care to follow the instructions , or you &apos;ll be put to sleep .

work site clos@@ es at 6 , it &apos;s a hard@@ -@@ hat area only .
&quot; T@@ f you see anything wei@@ rd , report it immediately . &quot;
X@@ oul &apos;ll live . You@@ l &apos;ll be fine .
Yes , we &apos;ve told him he &apos;ll live so he doesn &apos;t try to escape , but , um ...
Wa@@ it , what did he just say ?
Wa@@ it ! There &apos;s obviously been a mi@@ x-@@ up here . You &apos;ve got the wrong .
No , no , no !
It &apos;s you ?
You &apos;re not The Special ! You lied to me !
You &apos;re not even a Master@@ Buil@@ der , are you ?
Why don &apos;t you tell me what it is ? That way I could see if you &apos;re right .
Look , I &apos;m sorry , ok@@ ay ? You just .
And to think I was going to follow you to the end of the universe .
Qu@@ iet .
Do you have any idea what that does to your col@@ on ?
and this . And this . And this .
and what those big words in the sky were all about ?
Your home , Bri@@ ck@@ sburg , is one of many real@@ ms in the universe .
a b@@ unch of others we don &apos;t need to mention .
tell me the whole thing again . I wasn &apos;t listening
secret super weapon called .... The Kra@@ gle !
to h@@ unt down all the Master@@ Buil@@ ders , who were always changing everything
The only thing that can stop the Kra@@ gle .
It might have been that co@@ p . He said something about the Kra@@ gle
I can &apos;t make any sense of it .
I knew that was suspicious . There &apos;s no time to lose .
No , but thank you .
cap@@ turing all those Master@@ Buil@@ ders ...
Thank you , si@@ r .
The one thing that can ru@@ in my plans .
That &apos;s super fru@@ str@@ ating

Z@@ ap , z@@ ap , z@@ ap , po@@ w . Z@@ ap , po@@ w .
I made a mistake .
Not unlike this TV that Just showed up mag@@ ically .
and I thought to myself :
Intro@@ duc@@ ing the double-@@ deck@@ er couch .
That is literally the dum@@ best thing I &apos;ve ever heard .
There must be something around here ..
If The Man Ur@@ p@@ stairs chose him to be The Special
He doesn &apos;t even know about The Man Up@@ stairs .
that look like they &apos;re made out of big pink s@@ aus@@ ages ?
Wa@@ it . You &apos;ve seen the . ?
That &apos;s what I was just thinking about .
Well , I mean , I wasn &apos;t as@@ le@@ ep , so it wasn &apos;t really a dream .
I did
to have even a fle@@ eting gli@@ mp@@ se of The Man Up@@ stairs ..
With proper training
The proph@@ ec@@ y chose you , E@@ mm@@ et .
that the proph@@ ec@@ y says I &apos;m supposed to do .
Then .
Yes , I am .
Do you think Z@@ epp@@ el@@ ins are a bad investment ?
Wa@@ it a minute , partner .
These mechanical birds will get our message out .
torture weapons , poverty , le@@ ech@@ es , illi@@ ter@@ acy .

We have to save her from herself .
It means we go back to Santa Barbara
Sha@@ wn !
So what &apos;s he doing driving all the way into the hills
No , no , no , ice bar .
They &apos;re either for tourists or E@@ sk@@ im@@ os .
Let &apos;s go get loaded for Las@@ sie .
No , wait , Mr. K@@ ess@@ ler .
I don &apos;t like this , Sha@@ wn .
Well , you &apos;ll just have to be extra black , then .
These mit@@ tens are aw@@ fully restric@@ tive ,
What we should have done was wa@@ ited to see if
Hello .
We do , but first , I need to go .
Thank you for your hospitality , O@@ va .
Well , that &apos;s a regional term . G@@ us pre@@ fers &quot; playing football . &quot;
Now , you &apos;re pro@@ ving to be dangerous .
Sha@@ wn , G@@ us , what is going on ?
Have you ever seen &quot; Dir@@ ty Rot@@ ten Sco@@ und@@ rels &quot; ?
H@@ ey , could you do a quick pi@@ v@@ ot
Ok@@ ay . Ok@@ ay .
I got news for everybody .
I &apos;m not ready for you .
And what does that mean ?
What it means is that I get why you &apos;re here ,
I absolutely will not .
Mary , let me ask you ... Mary ?
He &apos;s resist@@ ing , Sha@@ wn !
It seems a bit one-@@ si@@ ded .
No g@@ ills .
You &apos;ve just been pre@@ ten@@ ding this whole time ?
I mean , I still have some num@@ b@@ ness on my right side ,
Why are you doing this ? Is this an insurance thing ?
No and no and stop tou@@ ching my sc@@ ar , man .
G@@ us . W@@ ake up , come on .
What ?
I think baby Mary was a hall@@ uc@@ ination .
Ye@@ ah .
I mean , the to@@ oth and the van story ,
I stopped taking mine , but it didn &apos;t help .
Did you know there are bodies in your fields ?
What ?
They know everything .
H@@ ey , look , if they find out that I &apos;m still lu@@ ci@@ d ,
But please don &apos;t give me up ,
The lying was killing me . I was having pan@@ ic attacks .
And apparently I sp@@ illed everything
A steep price .
How many of those ice chips did you eat ?
You kept eating them after we knew
H@@ a ! Dr. Her@@ sch ...
Well , h@@ ey , guys . How are we doing ?
I get to cover the night rounds
Tell me that isn &apos;t the guy I was supposed to be watching .
Sha@@ wn , will you get your hand off my kne@@ e ?
Some@@ one from this ice bar
Sha@@ wn , we &apos;ve done this routine before .
G@@ us , please , I &apos;m going to leave the le@@ ash on this time .
O@@ w . Good news , bad news .
I saw it with me own eyes .
S@@ hot him dead@@ . with a Black Ar@@ row .
V@@ e must look to our own .
Those who can stand , tend to the wounded
What then ? W@@ ha@@ c &apos; we do then
B@@ om b@@ ur ?
News of the death of Sm@@ au@@ g will have spread through the lands .
Others will now look to the Mountain .
What is it you know ?
It &apos;s what I fear may come .
The Or@@ c I pursued out of Lak@@ e-@@ town , I know who he is .
if there is no place for Tau@@ ri@@ el , there is no place for me .
It is your king &apos;s command .
To where ?
and destroyed once and for all .
Sau@@ ron can never again hold domin@@ ion over Mid@@ d@@ le-@@ earth .
They have no idea what is coming
The battle for the Mountain is about to begin .
I know it .
Not well enough .
And yet , it is still not found !
The people of Lak@@ e-@@ town have nothing
I know well enough their hard@@ ship .
They have much ... to be grateful for
That &apos;s it .
Another one
Your gr@@ atitude is mis@@ placed .
I came to rec@@ la@@ im something of mine .
White gem@@ s of pure star@@ light .
I know an El@@ f Lord who will pay a pretty price for these .
Ha@@ il , Thor@@ in , son of Th@@ rain .
Why do you come to the gates ... of the King under the Mountain armed for war ?
like a rob@@ ber in his hold ?
My lord
Will you not speak with me ?
On behalf of the people of Lak@@ e-@@ town ..
A share of the treasure .
I will not treat with any man .
Does it not tell you our cause is just ?
And in return , you brought upon them only ru@@ in and death .
A bar@@ gain was struck !
What choice did we have but to bar@@ ter our birth@@ right
in mort@@ al danger .
You know nothing ... of Wiz@@ ards .
But sometimes a storm .. is just a storm .
Our enemy has sum@@ mon@@ ed his full strength .
Because we forced him .
Are the arch@@ ers in position ?
Give the order .
You , Bow@@ man !
Is gold so important to you ?
It won &apos;t come to that .
to give you ... this .
The King &apos;s Je@@ wel .
How is this ... Y@@ ours to give ?
Why would you do this ?
I &apos;m not doing it for you .
They &apos;re suspicious and secre@@ tive ..
Not least this faith@@ less Wood@@ land spr@@ ite .
If he cho@@ oses ... to stand between me and my kin
He &apos;s clearly mad , like his c@@ ousin .
Let &apos;s give these b@@ ast@@ ards a good ham@@ mer@@ ing !
Then my sword is yours to command . Get up !
Make for the Great Hall !
with a single coin .
As if I were some low@@ ly D@@ warf Lord
I am not my grand@@ father . I am not my grand@@ father .
I lost it .
And I &apos;m very f@@ ond ... of you .
in a wide world after all
4 : 00 , Your Hon@@ or .
Well , all these powerful guys .
Not really .
That flag outside has been at half-@@ m@@ ast since April .
Oh . How &apos;s that work ?
This one is for all of the law@@ yers in the room
Oh , hold on .
You don &apos;t see us making you pay ..
Ok@@ ay , hold on . No@@ body move , I got this !
Every car alarm , every whi@@ st@@ le of the wind
I just want to Net@@ fli@@ x and M@@ om .
Ye@@ ah , thanks again for that , but it didn &apos;t help .
Ok@@ ay , that is it !
I tried to find happiness in the bottom of a bottle .
But enough about how I felt .
For some of Us , that was the last best time .
It didn &apos;t make any sense .
A lot of things ha@@ unt me .
The roads were very icy .
When I came to , the doctor told me we &apos;d been in a hor@@ ri@@ ble
Mit@@ ch@@ ell , this is the theater . Have some respect .
Mit@@ ch@@ ell , what are you doing ?
Oh , my beautiful B@@ ess .
Never had any children , of course .
To see each of you .
Ye@@ ah , they never say it .
They find little ways to express it .
You have to learn how to live on cr@@ um@@ bs .
Right .
It &apos;s ok@@ ay .
She invited a few of us out for coffee .
Ye@@ ah , no , u@@ h , not fun , actually .
It really just seemed like she wanted an audience .
Grab it .
Joe &apos;s sleeping in the couch .
And that no one discovered the body until it reached Ac@@ ap@@ ul@@ co ?
And that they then sent her body back in a Rub@@ ber@@ ma@@ id cool@@ er ..
before T@@ ina &apos;s husband could even claim it
I mean , I write remin@@ ders about my remin@@ ders .
H@@ ey , how is your daughter doing ?
Thanks for asking .
Ye@@ ah , you had p@@ ins in your legs for over a year .
Your doctor wants me to write an assessment
I have shown up to every fu@@ cking appointment .
Ok@@ ay , great .
And all of a sudden , I see a lady climb up on the ledge .
what did you do ?
And I was like , &quot; Don &apos;t jump ! Don &apos;t jump ! &quot;
It was@@ -@@ It was a pretty long time .
Maybe .
or subj@@ ective personality tra@@ its ,
I just came here for N@@ ina &apos;s address .
The one who killed herself . Ye@@ ah , that N@@ ina .
well , remember when I said I was kid@@ ding about the I@@ aw@@ suit ?
This is a very good so@@ ap . No buy at home .
Do you have pres@@ crip@@ tions ?
well , at the border , unless you have pres@@ crip@@ tions , they will take them away .
we open up Mary here .
You &apos;re a rich white woman . Have you ever been caught at anything ?
I have problems with anything religious .
They are my friends , Ir@@ ma and In@@ no@@ cen@@ cia .
Exc@@ use me . I &apos;ll be right back .
Goo@@ d-@@ b@@ ye .
Ok@@ ay . Goo@@ d-@@ b@@ ye , J@@ ason .
Not ton@@ igh@@ t. wouldn &apos;t be p@@ ru@@ dent .
I know . I will call her tomorrow
Pro@@ ve it .
I lied about N@@ ina not leaving a note .
Silv@@ ana told me about your accident .
well , Silv@@ ana needs to keep her fat mouth shut .
I pay her to care about me .
And don &apos;t you get sen@@ tim@@ ental either .
I can bar@@ ely save myself and my k@@ id .
Silv@@ ama ?
Silv@@ ana , you have this hab@@ it ...
But he is a friend , no ?
One of the last operating dri@@ ve-@@ in the@@ aters
How about that apple sau@@ ce ?
who ?
Tou@@ che , Im@@ el@@ da .
But I do like my shoes .
Not in an ir@@ onic way .
and I fell over 10,000 feet to the ground .
what &apos;s in LA ?
Ye@@ ah . That &apos;s a sad story .
Old enough .
Thank you .
As a prec@@ au@@ tion , no names .
They know me as a ban@@ ker , slightly b@@ ent ,
But before they put their money in ,
50,000 from each of us
Not that I expect a straight answer .
Well , it &apos;s rather difficult to say
And to your point , um .
Oh , dear . The first to break a rule .
Russi@@ ans
I didn &apos;t say that , did I ? M@@ mm ?
U@@ h , no . I wouldn &apos;t want to int@@ ru@@ de .
U@@ h , I &apos;ve got something to say .
We got off on the wrong foot .
Po@@ or so@@ d didn &apos;t even know I was there .
Your grand@@ mother &apos;s thro@@ wing cau@@ tion to the wind .
This is your go@@ ing-@@ away dinner .
That &apos;s right ! One &apos;s interest , one &apos;s assets , family .
I don &apos;t think you could call it a strategy
So , if we include the savings , the fund , and the house ,
May I call you Bet@@ ty ?
Is there a risk
So , your money would be helping those in need .
Double my money in five years ?
Oh , yes , what &apos;s that ?
You mean combine my money with Ro@@ y &apos;s ?
Well , yes , but we were married .
Invest@@ ing with Vincent is like winning the lot@@ tery
Stephen ?
Oh , did you ?
Why didn &apos;t you let me know you were back ?
Stand clear of the doors , please
If the Russi@@ ans were wi@@ red
Gre@@ edy old Ro@@ y .
Give me back my 100,000 qu@@ id .
Sorry ?
Will you say that again ?
I didn &apos;t expect there &apos;d be quite so many ballo@@ ons .
Still , prefer@@ able to being shot at .
I think someone &apos;s getting c@@ rank@@ y
I think I &apos;m gon@@ na go exploring
Do you know how many people were shot
I supp@@ ose you &apos;re about to tell me .
W@@ ent the day well ?
Oh , it &apos;s just , I took a tum@@ ble .
Yes . My name &apos;s Ro@@ y Cour@@ t@@ n@@ ay .
And I &apos;ve left my ke@@ yp@@ ad at home .
Bet@@ ty !
Oh , Robert &apos;s flight was del@@ ayed .
He called
Oh , I was looking at our joint account .
Different pass@@ code , different bank .
Agent Sel@@ f will provide that information .
Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t he say anything about a location ?
Which T-@@ Bag has .
Fin@@ ding where the break@@ -@@ in is doesn &apos;t mean anything
Algeri@@ a ? Turkey .
You know what ? Get with the program .
U@@ h , his name &apos;s E@@ rol Tab@@ ak .
Put this on the d@@ ash .
That &apos;s our guy .
Now , I have something else I need you to do for me .
T-@@ Bag &apos;s in town ?
He could be anywhere by now .
He ble@@ w this whole thing for all of us .
I wish I were .
Leave a message .
Call me back . Call .. me .. back as soon as possible .
Officer Ma@@ thers , he &apos;ll wait with you .
If you could just wait with me , ma &apos;@@ am .
What &apos;s going on ?
This is a nice mem@@ orial .
There &apos;s a lot of bad people out there .
Well , the priority for me is working out cust@@ ody of ben@@ j@@ amin .
No , I don &apos;t want to do this over the phone .
How about we meet in your office in about an hour ?
Or@@ son ?
She &apos;s sm@@ all-@@ time .
Wa@@ it . So you &apos;re just gon@@ na leave a drug dealer in our house ?
Well , good , when they drop by for their inspection ,
And after all , we &apos;re family .
Well , yes , since my ne@@ ph@@ ew aus@@ tin is ben@@ j@@ amin &apos;s biological father ,
She went after car@@ los and mi@@ ke and kar@@ l .
Yet .
What are you gon@@ na do ?
You &apos;re the one who asked me to go shopping .

I just .... it &apos;s good for US to hang out . I enjoy it .
No . All my idea .
Let &apos;s go home .
Oh , honey , we &apos;re about to have dinner .
But it &apos;s not a competition .
So , Howard , are you@@ -@@ interested ?
If I could control robot arms with my brain ,
My ride home with you was hel@@ lish .
No , thank you .
Well , then out you go .
Well , ever since A@@ my started working with Howard ,
And has she been home ?
Does it fru@@ str@@ ate you ?
You know , it &apos;s ok@@ ay to feel fru@@ str@@ ated
Ah , maybe it &apos;s not that big a deal .
Now , why don &apos;t you go wash up ,
Howard &apos;s really excited about his work ,
Come on , we don &apos;t need to lie to each other .

I &apos;m sorry , you find this funny ?
Boy , that was terrible .
When are they gon@@ na fix your elevator ?
All right , you two , don &apos;t start .
Can you please not ru@@ in it ?
This is how the U.S. Military works .
It could be foreign military pre@@ ten@@ ding to be American .
I also love the enemies of America .
Oh , of course not .
So , Alfred , what is it that you do for a living ?
I study ancient peoples and cultures .
He probably feels

I hate asking men for things .
You were born here ? How old are you ?
Ye@@ ah , you were born in a Wal@@ m@@ art , right ?

For the record , I did not ch@@ ase Andy away .
Right , that &apos;s why I helped him move out
So self-@@ involved .

That &apos;s how my Ash@@ ley was .
My first wife .
Face saving changes .

So then who do I meet , but one of the most ob@@ no@@ x@@ ious
Tro@@ l@@ ler .

She takes her job very seriously , al@@ right ?
I &apos;m in the process of getting over it .

These are like movie big shots she &apos;s hanging out with .
Artists , they are usually pas@@ sionate .
Ok@@ ay , you &apos;re right , I have to call her now .
You think there &apos;s that much of a r@@ ush , I don &apos;t know .
It &apos;s your idea .
There &apos;s nothing you can say . What do you mean ?
Christ , Ch@@ an , you just encouraged me to call her .
We have a number of things planned for today .
But , I really , I can &apos;t explain it over the phone .
What could possible be so secre@@ tive about that ?
Un@@ less there &apos;s some funny business going on ?
Oh , these , go@@ d@@ dam@@ n , cell@@ phones are ...

You &apos;ve always had a little bit of an attitude , ok@@ ay ?

No problem .

I mean , we have the means , right ?
David , look at this . There was a plane crash , David .
It happened five days ago .
Because that sounds crazy , du@@ de .
Som@@ ehow we caused the bask@@ etball team to not make the play@@ offs .
We all know that never happened .
And it just kept spreading
But where did you jump to ?
Stop it ! Stop it .
We ust have to make sure Jus@@ tin doesn &apos;t break his leg at Wal@@ ker &apos;s party .
You can fix it ? By yourself ?
1 mean , did you ever stop to think that maybe
Well , you know what I would have done ?
There he is ! Stop him !

Ten years total .
You think he was lost or something ?
You want to live ?
The airport &apos;s known as the main ar@@ tery to the outside world .
Plan@@ es were flying an hour ago . You got a phone ?
Bur@@ ned it up jac@@ king off to Queen , though .

You really paid the equivalent of ten million ri@@ al
Fre@@ d@@ die Mercur@@ y &apos;s ashes .
Come on .
I think it &apos;s time we get s@@ ane and head to the airport .
This is better . They control the station .
Where ?
Br@@ ing your weapons , I will stay on them .
We checked . There &apos;s enough fuel to get us out of Y@@ emen .
We &apos;ll find out .
We can find a way there , hop a train .
Dou@@ bling down on a bad bet .
More than they were already making :
I had a tra@@ cker in it , S@@ ara .

Let &apos;s do this .
It &apos;ll be fun .
DI paid my dues D
What do we do now ?
Lin@@ c , airport ?
I got someone I want you to talk to .
Now that &apos;s a voice I never thought I &apos;d hear again .
Where can we meet you ?
But you better hur@@ ry your ass up .
We could be there in 20 minutes .
Or if they accept D@@ ad@@ dy &apos;s application to live on Mars .
Oh , there &apos;s this company
You know , I came in thinking &quot; S@@ eth , &quot; but ..
You applied for a mission
Of course not .
Is@@ n &apos;t that right , Gi@@ us@@ ep@@ pe ?
you &apos;ll have to nail it .
Does she have any pil@@ lows or wine glasses ?
Great .
Did that feel good ?
Stay in school .
That &apos;s not happening .
Swe@@ eth@@ ear@@ t , don &apos;t you even want to talk about this ?
Even if he is one in a million ,
A professional mag@@ ician !
You w@@ anna just throw that away ?
This isn &apos;t about magic .
Look , you made a commitment . You will honor that commitment .

Gl@@ oria &apos;s s@@ nor@@ ing like a water buff@@ alo .
What , she put on 15 ? 20 ? 25 ? 30 ?
Well , for star@@ ters , you don &apos;t .
D@@ ad , your hot wife
It &apos;s a small sacrifice
All right , here we go : How &apos;s this ?
Ok@@ ay :

So how was it ? How was the big debut ?
Well , I stood and delivered .
Ye@@ ah
Ye@@ ah , I &apos;m on the other line with him right now .
Keep your eye on L@@ ily . She has a tenden@@ cy to w@@ ander off .
No . No , no , no , no .
I can hear it in your voice . Look in the dairy case .
the doors don &apos;t pull . They slide .
Thank you very much .
And watch your time . In the stage version ,
Use that anger , Lu@@ k@@ ini .
that holds the chal@@ ice of hope
H@@ ey , h@@ ey , h@@ ey ! Remember what we &apos;re gon@@ na do , ok@@ ay ?
Bo@@ o !
What &apos;s up , br@@ o ?

That &apos;s funny . Is this a rental ?
She &apos;s not European . She &apos;s American .
He just got d@@ ump@@ ed over email . He &apos;s devast@@ ated .
Just making a rain@@ bow .
Sorry .

No , I &apos;m not here for re@@ hab !
I &apos;m here for a y@@ oga re@@ treat !
It &apos;s just y@@ oga . And I thought it &apos;d be nice to come up here
Oh , my God . This is our dad &apos;s old ...
Ye@@ ah !
I love her so much .
I think I &apos;m done over here , bud@@ dy .
I think it &apos;s Christ@@ mass@@ y .
Ye@@ ah .
It &apos;s just two robust re@@ inde@@ er going at it .
H@@ ey , bu@@ d , no judgment .
Go gra@@ b me a ... .
Did you ask her why she was here ?
I don &apos;t know if she heard us .
I don &apos;t know what she was doing .
I &apos;m so sorry . Right . U@@ h
Right . Ok@@ ay .
Can you look at me , please ?
Lee , he &apos;s not your friend .
Ok@@ ay ?
Lee , promise us you &apos;re gon@@ na stop talking to Tob@@ i .
C@@ ould you come out here for a minute , honey ?
You &apos;re always hearing strange no@@ ises .
I got@@ ta go . My crazy mo@@ m is imag@@ ining things again .
O k@@ ay .
You think we should call the police ?
If we don &apos;t hear anything by morning ,
M@@ om , what happened ?
Oh , well . We cri@@ ed
Well , have you talked to him about it ?
I know . I know Phi@@ l &apos;s not the bri@@ gh@@ test cra@@ yon in the box .
That &apos;s what I kind of like about him , you know ?
I know that sounds per@@ verse , but he &apos;s kind of like my dad in that way .
I &apos;m gon@@ na get straight C &apos;s !
Phi@@ l is literally the boy next door .
He was so d@@ ull and st@@ up@@ id . I made fun of him .
But then , one night that summer ,
Oh , my God .
Look what the b@@ ats dra@@ gged in .
Oh , sh@@ it , he &apos;s coming over here .
Gu@@ y@@ S , be cool . Come on .
Sorry , I didn &apos;t know anyone was here .
H@@ ey .
Ok@@ ay .
He &apos;s a nice boy .
He &apos;s rented a tu@@ x , and everything
God , I have no idea .
She had no other choice , maybe ?
I gu@@ ess life with my father must have been pretty ble@@ ak and mis@@ erable for her .
What do you mean , different ?
Ok@@ ay . Sorry to bo@@ ther you , Mrs. Conn@@ ors .
All right .
Well ,
One day I hope some mus@@ ky mach@@ o stu@@ d will fu@@ ck the sh@@ it out of me too .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah . When ? When ?
Why ? Because I fu@@ cked an old guy ?
Oh , my God . What are you talking about ?
And M@@ ick@@ ey , who &apos;s basically a fat ch@@ ick in a sk@@ inny g@@ ay body .
Mr. Con@@ nor , this is Sher@@ yl from the L@@ oma Lin@@ da Police Department .
Thank you for your cooperation , and have a nice day .
I have no idea .
My dad ? Bet@@ h , have you met him ?
What ? No . Wh@@ atever . I &apos;m sure it &apos;s nothing
N@@ ope . I just picked up a few things .
Is there news about your mother ?
Well , wh@@ o@@ op@@ -@@ de@@ e-@@ do . So , you going to join us for dinner , Bet@@ h ?
D@@ ad , why would they want you to take a lie det@@ ector test ?
What is it ? What &apos;s going on ?
Go to bed , mo@@ m .
Seri@@ ously , just go back to bed .
So ? That &apos;s enough to know that he &apos;s hot , and smart ,
Ye@@ ah , that was enough .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah . I &apos;d say so . I mean , I definitely feel more comfortable in my own skin .
And I assume you haven &apos;t heard from your mother .
I don &apos;t know . It &apos;s kind of gotten to the point where
K@@ at , this is May . May , K@@ at .
I &apos;ve heard so much about you .
D@@ ad , I told you I am thri@@ lled that you met someone .
T@@ ook off your wedding ring
Why bo@@ ther ? I mean , mo@@ m left us .
It &apos;s about time we et on with our lives .
W@@ ha@@ c ?
There was a spo@@ on at the bottom of the sink , and
Nothing .
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah ?
Hard@@ ly ever talk about your mother .
I don &apos;t think I agree with that .
You really want my opinion ?
Ex@@ haus@@ tive ? You guys bar@@ ely even looked for her .
Not a single trace was ever found .
So where do you think she is ?
What ?
We did a thor@@ ough background check on your father .
My dad is a fu@@ cking w@@ im@@ p .
Not according to Bob and Mar@@ gie Car@@ l@@ sen .
to live next door to them in Ri@@ ver@@ side
That &apos;s better . That &apos;s it . Come on , give it a wh@@ ack .
Ye@@ ah . I was just helping your mo@@ m with dinner .
Hi , Mrs. Hill@@ man . It &apos;s K@@ at . I &apos;m sorry , were you in bed ?
I ... I haven &apos;t been feeling well .
No . He isn &apos;t .
Nothing . We &apos;re just talking , and drinking champagne .
What are you talking about ?
Are you jo@@ king ?
You can &apos;t tell me what to do
Oh , my God . What is your problem ?
You too .
Are you all right ?
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah ?
What do you mean ?
Re@@ ally ?
What did you want to talk to me about ?
You know , I feel like after .
We were different . You were different .
F@@ hi@@ l , where were you that day ? You were supposed to pick me up from school .
It doesn &apos;t matter anymore . You don &apos;t have to lie .
I can &apos;t help you , K@@ at .
But I will tell you one thing
What do you mean ?
You can &apos;t leave .
I didn &apos;t know his last name was Blo@@ om .
Are you really gon@@ na lie on the floor
H@@ ey , what about this ? It looks like a receipt .
For a cup of coffee .
From the future ? !
So one of us came back from the future
Ok@@ ay , ok@@ ay . Everything is fine .
Light@@ ning shut out of your but@@ t , and now they &apos;re coming for you .
Wa@@ it ... Where are all the mus@@ h@@ rooms ?
Oh , no , I lost my rings !
No kids allowed in here .
He &apos;s actually 43 years old ,
like ... like that .
Make us a Mel@@ low Yellow please .
You ow@@ e me one .
How are you not dead ?
But do you see me dancing ?
Is that all you &apos;ve got ?
Son@@ ic !
You go , I &apos;ll catch up .
In@@ coming !
You just had one . It &apos;s mine !
Ye@@ ah , right , D@@ ad .
Just drive the car .
And if I don &apos;t make it , just dit@@ ch me ,
I kin@@ da feel like I checked the &apos; save the life@@ &apos;
I w@@ anna check that box .
All right , everybody . Nothing to see here .
That &apos;s why , in the subur@@ bs , there is nothing more dec@@ ep@@ tive than a smile .
She said d@@ yl@@ an &apos;s not the same girl .
I know it sounds wei@@ rd , but ju@@ lie says d@@ yl@@ an does not remember anything about living here .
But if I were your wife ..
Oh , honey , people talk ... angry people dis@@ appointed people .
No , no , l don &apos;t need magaz@@ in@@ es.@@ I need company .
So ...
So tell me some@@ th@@ ing.@@ When you go to a ri@@ b@@ bon cutting ,
You know , l have the cut@@ est sha@@ w@@ l in the car ,
did I ever tell you about my father ?
Star@@ ted in the liver , went into his bones ,
I &apos;m not finished .
she did have the key ...
oh , h@@ ey what &apos;s up ?
Su@@ re@@ .@@ What do you need ... fl@@ our , Su@@ gar ?
57 grand in debt .
f course .
There &apos;s good jobs out there .
Fu@@ ck off , you fu@@ cking b@@ ast@@ ard ! Get to fu@@ ck !
Fu@@ ck &apos;s sake .
It was on the walls , all over me .
Well , listen . Just calm down .
My daughter , Li@@ za Jane , she &apos;s .
My wife &apos;s up the wall with it .
I &apos;m not finishing till late .
Just get a replacement driver , won &apos;t cost you a p@@ enny
I@@ ve been speaking to the drivers as well
It &apos;s good you &apos;re using your initiative , though It shows planning ahead .
It &apos;s just , er@@ m
I had four drivers in here last week .
Second driver , his sister had a stroke .
Four@@ th driver , his daughter tried to commit suicide .
My old man was a far@@ mer . He mil@@ ked c@@ ows .
Do you w@@ anna know why &apos; m number one ?
They couldn &apos;t sive a sh@@ it if you fall as@@ le@@ ep at the wheel
And all of that gets fed back into this box .
This decides who lives and who dies .
pat@@ ron sa@@ int of n@@ asty b@@ ast@@ ards .
Hello
Well , is he there ? Can I speak to him ?
i@@ ve your head a sha@@ ke , get through school , get a job , car , holiday
You &apos;ve got a family that care about you , that love you .
And we &apos;re done for if you don &apos;t w@@ at h your temp@@ er . You &apos;re exhau@@ sted
I can &apos;t have that
Once that line &apos;s crossed , you can &apos;t go back .
Did you not see it . He came at me , it wasn &apos;t the other way round .
It would be har@@ sh . You should prepare yourself .
Which means every sur@@ geon in this room
See you in the OR .
Get out of here
You pre@@ ten@@ ding like nothing happened ?
H@@ unt literally tried to kill you .
That doesn &apos;t mean you have to stand by .
So how is it anymore acceptable that I walk away from this ?
It &apos;s not cut and drive .
Clear .
From your lips to God &apos;s ears
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah ? I &apos;m not the one who needs help around here .
I &apos;m not the one who half this hospital is talking about
dr@@ . b@@ ail@@ ey . I &apos;m not assi@@ sting you ,
A year from now , you need to be able to do this stuff .
You really think I &apos;m gon@@ na be here a year from now ?
For@@ c@@ eps .
I &apos;m gon@@ na see your dick
Ye@@ ah , but it does put people with the one .
But how do you know they &apos;re perfect matches ?
Each time you get a little bit more p@@ liable ,
And then you have to live the rest of your life
Every crazy thought you &apos;ve ever had ,
Right . So if it &apos;s everything in your head ..
All right , so now you &apos;re gon@@ na say :
Once shor@@ tened , the exp@@ iry date cannot be extended .
Everything happens for a reason .
So what does she want ?
She &apos;s just walking around , asking everybody ,
Go sit back down with your horn .
There &apos;s something wrong with it .
Ever@@ ett !
I don &apos;t know what you said , F@@ ay .
Penn@@ y , give me your horn .
So it &apos;s not broken ?
Dou@@ b@@ le-@@ dealing de@@ vil@@ -@@ dog . That had me so sc@@ ared .
You can always do that if someone &apos;s a wet ra@@ g .
Well , I can &apos;t do that to someone .
It &apos;s st@@ opping someone from embar@@ rass@@ ing themselves .
P@@ utting up the numbers means
I &apos;m sorry , you two . I &apos;m gon@@ na need to see a license for that .
Then come up with some other way to fill up this tape rec@@ order .
Although , I was enjoying it back there
Tell me the cra@@ zi@@ est c@@ aller you ever had .
Not about a c@@ aller , but about
You certainly can ,
I know it isn &apos;t . I don &apos;t care .
What else you got in there ?
You don &apos;t believe me , do you ? You &apos;re just pul@@ ling my leg .
I love it . I &apos;m inter@@ viewing you . I &apos;m playing a part .
Do we have time to do those two ?
All right , if you like that , bra@@ ce your brain for this .
You tell me all about it .
H@@ old on , &apos; cause I w@@ anna read it to you the way it was written ,
So , &quot; Picture a man in New York City , in Times Square .
They were tall .
Ye@@ ah .
Maybe there &apos;s a couple of families ,
And I don &apos;t mean that because they &apos;re Indi@@ ans .
That means we &apos;re gon@@ na lose .
No . Why ?
Ar@@ lo &apos;s working on it though .
All right , I &apos;m off .
Ok@@ ay , b@@ ye .
No , I was watching TV .
Like what ?
something that just came in through the board
All right . Connect it .
I &apos;ve never heard that before .
She said there was something going on out of town
And when did you say my show got cut into ?
But this one ... wor@@ ried me .
Prob@@ ably &apos; cause it was so secre@@ tive .
Well , we built the ceiling over this thing , carefully .
And when the prop@@ ellers had started sp@@ inning
The same sound you just played ton@@ ight .
Oh , I couldn &apos;t forget it .
And then the sound disappeared and we got further away .
And in the next few weeks ,
And I think wh@@ ate@@ ver@@ . that area of the desert
You work at the radio station ?
It was something in the sky .
I do the new ...
I don &apos;t like new stuff , but Ger@@ rie does .
Yes , Ever@@ ett &apos;s here . Would you like to speak with him here ?
Ever@@ ett , come to board one !
Wa@@ it , what ?
I don &apos;t know .
Sir , Vi@@ per 31 went below ra@@ dar and a right turn .
T@@ f there ever was a Rain@@ maker there
And no one from Stri@@ ke Operation to the F@@ ent@@ ag@@ on ..
Who@@ ever it was had the confirmation codes
Defense knows the tap@@ es are missing ..
Any of these men could &apos;ve destroyed the hut tap@@ es .
But the prosec@@ ution it &apos;s in@@ ability to produce Hut Tap@@ es .
Exc@@ use me , Your Hon@@ or ,
But even more significant than that
But God help the U.S. Navy if they &apos;re allowed to remain in it .
Is to res@@ ign your comm@@ ision
Thank you , but no .
L@@ ooks like you could use some .
And one from being broke .
I might end up working for you . Al@@ right ?
So this is about more money .
Until the Americans are gone .
You and your friends at Ge@@ op@@ et@@ rol .
Well , T@@ em@@ ir , I &apos;m glad we put that on the table ..
If you and your people ..
No money ,
The air show ?
You got that ? I &apos;m sorry we were late .
It will not happen again , ok@@ ay ?
Hi , is this good for both of us ?
Unlike the last two times
To@@ o long , man .

You sure you don &apos;t want to hang out ?
I need some sleep .
A Special Force , like my dad .
He &apos;s pretty bra@@ ve .
You want to meet my mo@@ m ?
Do you really think Web@@ ster can fix our records ?
What do we have to do ?
And those guys who choose to stay .
H@@ ey look , guys .
I just don &apos;t see any point you &apos;re taking any unnecessary risks .
Wa@@ it a minute .
It &apos;s not about money for me .
I &apos;m a fighter pilot .
I &apos;ve lost too many friends already , So ..
I am a weekend war@@ ri@@ or who flies cargo .
You don &apos;t like it when old characters s@@ ne@@ ak back into the script .
But then you &apos;re familiar with them .
A drama can be exciting .
T live in Russia .
It &apos;ll take about 45 minutes to gli@@ de the 20 miles over the border .
Exc@@ use me si@@ r .
You &apos;ve all had jump training , right ?
Can we just fly commercial to Azer@@ ba@@ i@@ jan ?
You &apos;ll use GPS to guide you to the air@@ field
It seems that my ex
Your friends were wor@@ ried about you .
My wing man , finally get to my left door .

A little tea for our guests , please .
Actually thank you , but .
Put that back , Vas@@ qu@@ ez .
We &apos;re going to have to det@@ ain you for a while .
He was a poor man .
100 years for now , mankind might not even be here .
Would not be our name , but whether or not we had money .
Is are you gon@@ na be a rich man .
No no no , I know you &apos;ve been patient , I know this is hard .
We just change the plan .
Why don &apos;t we just drop Rain@@ maker and be done with it ?
You kill the bear in its sleep .
Tom Cra@@ ig taught a lot of these men to fly .
And what about my son ?
What &apos;s more , your boy is gon@@ na watch his father fight for freedom .
You think about that
Close up to the General , ask him if he car@@ ed
He may start soon .
Ye@@ ah Cob@@ ra .. To the moon , Cob@@ ra !

What the hell did you do ?
Some@@ thing &apos;s not right , here .

Put your hand up .
I lost my father when I was your age .
Why don &apos;t you take a shot at him ?
First left , then immediate right
It &apos;s getting nar@@ ro@@ wer . It &apos;s all part of the plan .
Good plan .
Take another left through the window .
My work here is done .
Your job here is done when I tell you it &apos;s done .
T@@ t shoul@@ da been .
They were waiting for me .
What was waiting for me was bar@@ ely human .
A little tired this morning , si@@ r ?
Any@@ thing in particular , si@@ r , or .. ?

Well , now , she &apos;s something else al@@ together .
She &apos;s the real fan@@ atic
How .
We have no choice but to work together on this .
It will be located on a computer disk .
You , solo , are to investigate
O@@ leg . Give my regards to N@@ ina .
Your corrupt and criminal background ...
But what interests me , given your profile ,
What &apos;s he doing here ?
Do@@ esn &apos;t get any more Russian than the red per@@ il here .
It &apos;s your cover .
The Ri@@ us@@ sian minister of culture
And naturally , you &apos;d introduce him
Jack de@@ ven@@ y ,
I think your feet are a little small .
D@@ ear@@ est .
Enjoy your coffee .
I enjoyed last night .
What does that mean ?
Come on .
P@@ ump the bra@@ kes , my Russian friend .
Besides , I wouldn &apos;t be wearing my engagement ring

They had it coming
Try not to get lost .
Why ?
Make mistake .
At k@@ g@@ b , we call it the k@@ iss .
Although he &apos;s standing u@@ pri@@ ght , he &apos;s completely un@@ conscious .
Can &apos;t touch .
Why do you think they have radiation tools and suit
We wouldn &apos;t have found that without my father &apos;s watch .
Be my guest .
Oh , don &apos;t be so hard on yourself .
The fault doesn &apos;t lie in your performance .
She gave you up like an un@@ wanted kit@@ ten .
And how is that
The Russi@@ ans and the Americans thought they were using me ,
She seemed so innocent .
It &apos;s a tracking device .
I &apos;m sure my ..
I think I need to make a telephone call .
&apos;ve been here before .
I &apos;m afraid that isn &apos;t going to stop you getting hurt .
Only my mother calls me Napoleon .
What history has failed to relate
Hello again , Mr. solo .
There &apos;s a short in the wir@@ ing
My ap@@ ologies .
I &apos;m so sorry I can &apos;t stay to finish you off myself .
And I want it to be slow
You wouldn &apos;t describe him
Because of this boy &apos;s apparent short@@ com@@ ings ,
But what the other boys didn &apos;t understand about their victim
There are two kinds of torture , Mr. solo .
The other
&apos;m in an ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned mood .
I never thought I &apos;d say this .
You doing ok@@ ay , cow@@ boy ?
You did . T@@ ust not the ones in your shoes .
You don &apos;t have to do things to me to make me talk .
You won &apos;t be able to stop me .
She betra@@ yed you . I will testi@@ fy .
T@@ f &apos;s not the same .
Will you give us a minute ?
I &apos;ll be right here .
We have to get to that island .
You &apos;re the one he &apos;s been having fun with .
But on the other hand , i know exactly what &apos;ll happen .
He &apos;s prepared to sell his ass on this ,
A man with that skill set &apos;s never w@@ anting for employment .
Just give me a minute .
Dam@@ n .
Follow me .
They will send an army to stop us .
The line is secured . You &apos;re now connected , si@@ r .
Kill the Russian , if necessary .
Well , now if the Nazis are due to take delivery
There is also , of course ,
Well , she &apos;s not British . &quot; She &quot;
Gab@@ y &apos;s working for you , isn &apos;t she ?
You got there in the end .
A daughter &apos;s touch .
Now that is a good idea .
She knew that the ring you gave her was bu@@ gged
And , of course , you are not average ,
You told Gab@@ y to drop us in it
Well , that is a very poor translation , solo , but ...
Thank you very much .
Well , it &apos;s known as a cou@@ pler .
t &apos;s left over from when this was a war@@ head
I &apos;m sorry .
Those are the words we &apos;ve been waiting to hear .
Let &apos;s both stop playing games , shall we ?
If you don &apos;t hear from me in 20 minutes , kill her .
You can start by putting back the correct lens , professor .
You &apos;ll get killed , and I &apos;m not gon@@ na let that happen .
We made it all the way home from Iraq alive ,
I think you love me .
And I think that you tried to get Sh@@ ep@@ herd to get rid of me
Fine . No one .
I &apos;m taking myself out of this equ@@ ation , and I am ...
He &apos;s dead .
We stay here , we &apos;re sitting du@@ cks .
Who are you calling ?
For a resident , I &apos;m very good .
I can &apos;t do this if you &apos;re in there star@@ ing at me
April ...
I want you to stay with her .
Stop cr@@ ying .
And even then , it took me a long time
he &apos;s lying on a table in there and my best friend &apos;s
Re@@ ed was my best friend .
Sh@@ h . Please , stop y@@ elling .
Oh , dam@@ n it !
Dr. B. , please , please . Please .
Turn the elev@@ ators back on !
Stop , stop , stop . Please , Dr. B .
You ... stay back .
I know . I know . Just keep going . Keep going .
H@@ ey ! H@@ ey ! That is the woman that I love .
I said stay back .
I shoot you , and then I shoot her
He &apos;s responsible .
People been kind . And generous .
Ye@@ ah , he come by .
Was there any@@ body with him ?
Christopher Morgan
M@@ mm@@ -@@ h@@ mm . Ye@@ ah , that &apos;s him .
Bob@@ by asked us for a picture once of St@@ ev@@ ie .
He come over here and wanted to show St@@ ev@@ ie a ring
And I gave him one .
Well , we &apos;re gon@@ na need to get some pictures of St@@ ev@@ ie
Just , you know , part of our investigation .
Oc@@ ean@@ side PD . How may I direct your call ? U@@ h-@@ hu@@ h . Right
When I sold him some ice cream .
When you would go out to Rob@@ in H@@ ood W@@ oods ,
Did you ever see anything out there ?
I ran and Jes@@ sie caught me .
He tried to cut me on my side .
Then he grab@@ bed my hands and made me cut Chris .
Jes@@ sie , on Wednesday , May 5 , 1993 , early in the morning ,
Then I went with them up to the ... Up to the Rob@@ in H@@ ood .
This is Paul Ford from Ton@@ es@@ bor@@ o .
And Val Price is the public def@@ ender who &apos;s been appointed
Does that surprise you ?
G@@ ot any experts lined up ?
He was once diagnos@@ ed as ment@@ ally re@@ tar@@ ded .
In my experience , most of them are .
Because if you don &apos;t have a strong case ,
And I worry about that baby .
Because of the rum@@ or that they &apos;re going to sacrifice it to Satan .
You &apos;re working for them ? What are you , like a lawyer &apos;s assistant ?
But you won &apos;t be representing me in court .
So I &apos;m just supposed to trust you ? Tell you everything
They will do anything to get people to say what they want to hear .
Why did those girls say people were wit@@ ches back in Sal@@ em ?
I did that with a knife . That &apos;s my girlfriend &apos;s name .
Why ?
Through drinking the blood of others .
I &apos;ve been doing it since I was , i@@ ke , 10 J@@ ears old .
And everybody knows they .... I heard from a b@@ unch of people
You don &apos;t dress like that when you ... When you , um ....
Did he like sc@@ ou@@ ting ?
I saw you on TV .
You &apos;re supposed to be in mo@@ ur@@ ning .
What &apos;s that supposed to mean ?
Ac@@ ting like a go@@ d@@ dam@@ n sil@@ ly f@@ ool .
Is that what you &apos;ve been doing ?
What the hell are you talking about ?
You shut up !
Go ahead . H@@ it me . H@@ it me . I d@@ are you , hit me .
I need to talk to you about something , in person .
It &apos;s really important . Ok@@ ay . Good night .
Jes@@ sie started running and caught Steve .
Then , um , they took them ,
And nobody knows what happened but me .
May I have a tea , please ?
It &apos;s good to hear from you ,
Then they came by my office ,
I was so insul@@ ted , I was so angry ,
TA &apos;s fine
It &apos;s just that with all the pap@@ er@@ work in the case ,
The police seem so certain . Are you sure you want to do this ?
It &apos;s just that sometimes you take these things so personally .
You know , if the police are so go@@ d@@ dam@@ ned certain about their case
R@@ on , please don &apos;t .
All the way down to Ten M@@ ile Ba@@ you .
We ought to just fr@@ y him and get it over with .
cra@@ w@@ led on my hands and kne@@ es and felt along with my hands
U@@ h , yes , si@@ r . I played this .
And after hearing the tape , what was the def@@ endant &apos;s reaction ?
Then he said that he was present when the boys were mur@@ dered .
The ver@@ dic@@ ts read as follows .
&quot; And of second degree murder in the deaths of Christopher B@@ yers
Do you think it was a just and a proper sentence ?
It &apos;s one down , two to go .
And they pra@@ yed to their De@@ vil and they pra@@ yed to their Satan ,
There &apos;s a war going on .
Ye@@ ah . He did do something strange . Very strange .
So when were you planning on telling us about it ?
But you &apos;ve known about it for months . How could you not tell US about it ?
There was blood on the knife .
You feature promin@@ ently in the prosec@@ ution &apos;s case .
No . No , I can &apos;t talk about it .
Det@@ ective Donald Bra@@ y ?
Michael Moore and Chris B@@ yers are his two best friends .
I &apos;d say it &apos;s very possible . Right , honey ? It is possible .
He told us about the meetings in the woods .
You knew about the cul@@ t ?
Ques@@ tioned V@@ ick@@ i .
She said no .
Jes@@ sie !
It &apos;s all right .
But did you ever find any evidence to cor@@ ro@@ bor@@ ate
No physical evidence . But we got something e se .
So V@@ ick@@ i &apos;s plan failed , right ?
Ye@@ ah , but V@@ ick@@ i &apos;s plan got Jes@@ sie involved ,
And J@@ ason Bal@@ d@@ win gets caught in the net just by pic@@ king the wrong friend .
Are they gon@@ na put Aaron on the stand ?
Oh , but they did hear from him .
&quot; No@@ body knows what happened but me . &quot;
Look at this .
This police report was signed by Det@@ ective Rid@@ ge
This is a go@@ d@@ dam@@ n wit@@ ch h@@ unt .
And once they set their sights on J@@ ason and Dam@@ ien ,
Wh@@ atever it takes .
No@@ body will . No@@ body but you .
Wash@@ ing away your sins . C@@ alling on the name of the Lord .
nd how were you accepted into en@@ roll@@ ment at Columbia Pacific University ?
Did you have to fill out a little fl@@ yer like this ?
Did you know this was a correspon@@ dence school ? I didn &apos;t .
We object to Dr. Griff@@ is as an expert .
What do you want me to do ? Do you want me to lie to you ?
And all the other bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it .
Chris !
Your Hon@@ or , may we approach ?
My understanding was that this young man re@@ trac@@ ted his statement .
Why would his testimony be relevant ?
I &apos;m not gon@@ na allow you to drag in every possible susp@@ ect
Your Hon@@ or , they could just talk to any@@ body on the street and they could say ,
This was the Oc@@ ean@@ side PD
I &apos;m gon@@ na ask you .... .
... to go back to the jury room .
Bob@@ by De@@ Angel@@ o asked for a picture of my son and
Yes , you do , Mrs. Hob@@ bs . We all do .
Yes .
We are going to be all right . Justice is gon@@ na be se@@ wed , and we love you ,
Ye@@ ah , after 17 hours I believe any@@ body would .
And immediately after that , did you again deny any knowledge
It was so important to get that k@@ id on the stand
But the judge says that &apos;s not relevant
You can &apos;t see p@@ ant of the tape
We have a syn@@ op@@ sis from the Oc@@ ean@@ side F@@ D .
Since when do we depend on police reports ?
But you should have told Bur@@ nett .
The library had these books they were getting rid of for 10 c@@ ents each .
That was already done when I got it .
Ok@@ ay .
I@@ was told I@@ look good in it .
T@@ m familiar with it .
Based on his writ@@ ings , he believes in human sacrifice , doesn &apos;t he ?
His writ@@ ings indicated that children were the best type of human sacrifice .
Yes , si@@ r .
Now , all this Sat@@ anic stuff ? It doesn &apos;t matter whether I believe it .
It doesn &apos;t even matter whether you believe in it .
Now , you look at history ,
And when you look at it all together ,
The first ver@@ dict reads as follows .
Exp@@ ect typical comm@@ s problems .
If we miss two windows ,
Wa@@ y@@ point one is Bud@@ wei@@ ser .
How is that gon@@ na help me ?

It was Elizabeth , and her absolute faith ...
And she gave thanks , saying , my soul d@@ oth mag@@ ni@@ fy the Lord ..

I &apos;m definitely a true belie@@ ver ,

Gro@@ ss . What ?
Ok@@ ay , look , no need to be def@@ ensive , ok@@ ay ? I &apos;m not exactly threatened by this guy .
So , what does your boy@@ friend think of me ?
I &apos;m interested in the opinion of an as@@ sh@@ ole .
Mark O &apos;@@ Bri@@ en is the oldest of four children ..
He was extremely nervous .
He cannot masturb@@ ate , has had only the occasion@@ al k@@ is@@ sing experience .
I just started working with this gent@@ lem@@ an who sp@@ ends almost his entire life .
I want you to look at me this time .

I had a feeling it was never going to happen but I think today &apos;s the day .
Stop thinking about it .
You &apos;re not listening , are you ? Stop thinking about it .
I &apos;m so sorry . I forgot .
Look , it may not be exactly what we had in mind ..
I mean , as an adult .
Looking at him , with his ...
What does your husband do ?

He runs the house and plays guitar .
It &apos;s getting late .
You should be thri@@ lled .
You were really and truly inside me .
Is that all ?
You were pretty excited . I don &apos;t know what you were thinking about .
Well , you definitely achieved penetration .
Cher@@ yl .
No , Mark , I didn &apos;t .
Is that what you want ?
Oh , thanks . You &apos;re welcome .
You know , we don &apos;t have to do much talking .
And I want people to say , &quot; H@@ ey , who &apos;s that g@@ im@@ p with that beautiful bl@@ ond ?
As your boy@@ friend ?

You can &apos;t let them get off lightly .
In the end , what I learned
My stro@@ kes are mine .
Old Adam &apos;s pain@@ t@@ brush .
That is the end of our show .
You live the stories that we live to hear .
It was real long .
Your treat , and she &apos;s coming .
Well , we &apos;re spent fort@@ y-@@ d@@ oll@@ ar@@ s-@@ ally .

Again , we can &apos;t compare our tru@@ ths .
You lost billi@@ ons ?
And with what I lost ton@@ ight , $ 5 billion , $ 40 .
Thanks for the offer , but I &apos;m not really a writer .
Plus , I &apos;m trying to put my story behind me .
It pays $ 50 . Here &apos;s my card .
That &apos;s my other job .
And sometimes renting a car is actually cheaper
To finally tell my story and give it closure ?
I &apos;m here for the surro@@ g@@ acy interview .
Look at all these woman trying to get pregnant .
H@@ an , can I go work in your office ?
I promise I won &apos;t play with your Leg@@ os .

All gas stations On 80 , 30 , 77 .
Who knows what he knows ?
Don &apos;t worry about Sco@@ field and Bur@@ rows right now .
I &apos;ve got very powerful people behind me
Pap@@ er@@ work &apos;s sitting on the right
And what do I have to do ?
Paul , where are you ?

Hand@@ ing over . T@@ aking over .

The earth sh@@ ook for five straight minutes .
And that &apos;s not the biggest earthquake ever recorded .
B@@ am .
.. that le@@ vel@@ ed Hil@@ o , Hawaii 8@@ 000 miles away .
So , um ..
It &apos;s the de@@ mar@@ cation line between two t@@ ec@@ ton@@ ic plates that are constantly moving
.. I &apos;d say it &apos;s not a matter of if .
How soon before you get her fixed ?
El@@ gin , you move any faster , you &apos;re gon@@ na break that hip .
Ye@@ ah . Le@@ aving tomorrow . Dri@@ ving her back up to school .
I figure we cruise up the coast . Do a little camping .
Now , we got a rare low-@@ level sei@@ sm@@ ic s@@ warm out in Fal@@ co , Nevada .
Where the hell is Tal@@ co , Nevada ?
All right .
Any known faul@@ ts . Now , if we get there while the mini qu@@ akes continue
Then we &apos;re predic@@ ting them . Then we are predic@@ ting them .
Let &apos;s go check it out .
I was wondering if there was room for my bike .
That &apos;s a great idea . I &apos;m sure I could figure out a way to fit it in .
Lake Hav@@ as@@ u City , Ne@@ ed@@ les , Bl@@ y@@ the and Lau@@ gh@@ lin also suffered major damage .

A@@ wesome . Oh .
Sus@@ an . It &apos;s nice to finally meet you .
Nothing important . What &apos;s going on ?
No , Ray , really .
I just wasn &apos;t ready to hear about you and B@@ lake moving in with someone else .
H@@ ey , how &apos;s B@@ lake feel about it ? You know .
I think it &apos;s gon@@ na be hard for her to ..
Oh , my God . We &apos;re having an earthquake .
La@@ wr@@ ence , the Richter just j@@ ump@@ ed from a 6.5 to an 8.5 .
Po@@ wers of ten !
Don &apos;t worry . Cal@@ tech is probably the saf@@ est place to be right now .
And it &apos;s heading toward San Francisco .
Ok@@ ay .
B@@ ye , B@@ lake . It was nice meeting you , as well .
Oh , and , um ...
Tell Ben that I &apos;ll put in a good word for him .

And , if you can &apos;t , you need to find any means possible ...
II doesn &apos;t matter .
What &apos;s the point ?
And then coming home every day to you and B@@ lake only made it harder .
It was perfect .
I just didn &apos;t know how .
I really am .
then nobody could have
Let &apos;s go ! Keep it moving ! Let &apos;s go !
Do you mind if I ask why you wear two of the same neckl@@ aces ?
I started wearing it after she died .

There was a massive bom@@ b , but it was set

You look like you &apos;ve never made a correct decision .
I have definitely given a back@@ -@@ al@@ ley blowjob .

S@@ hot@@ gun to the dick . His dest@@ iny .
I &apos;ve just ru@@ ined my own life
Up until yesterday , I thought I had a normal life .

What do you think ?
I fu@@ cking hate you , L@@ ou .
S@@ ophie ! H@@ ey ! Where are you going ?

We got@@ ta make America happen , br@@ o .
You know , you &apos;re not gon@@ na be super welcome there ,
That par@@ ade was the single greatest moment of my life .

Ye@@ ah . S@@ ure you did , bud@@ dy .
I wasn &apos;t jo@@ king yesterday . I was serious .
And I think you should , too .
To live in this extraordinary place
I told you you &apos;d think it was crazy .
Everything is .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s crazy .
For now .
It &apos;s done . We &apos;re done . It &apos;s over .
Apart from the fact that the welcome decor@@ ations are down ,
The party &apos;s still a day away .
He &apos;s actually a journalist , and he wants to write
What ?
I know .
I &apos;m pregnant .
In exactly the same place that she was .
And I have you and my three d@@ ads ,
She must have been so sc@@ ared .

Well , Manager , I need to get out of there
Me , me , me , me , me ,
You don &apos;t even have to pre@@ tend it &apos;s about anyone else .
Pre@@ t@@ ty much every single day still .
The good news is the r@@ ash is not spreading past my nuts .
Did it have anything to do with the r@@ ash ?
It &apos;s not a traditional Polish wedding
Take it down a not@@ ch .
Oh , hi , I &apos;m not here to buy , just to look .
since 1998 .
Can I just smell a piece ?
It &apos;ll get you going , and then hal@@ f@@ way to Paris ,
Oh , Paris remin@@ ds me .
I once hi@@ d in the luggage cart for 12 hours
Me , every third Tuesday .
I am watching the doors !
Ye@@ ah , real funny , si@@ r .
Je@@ ez ! How could a dress be this big ?
I have to get something out of my bag .
I can &apos;t find it . Here , take this .
A hundred dollars in change .
It &apos;s a Polish custom to throw change at the bri@@ de .
Is this a wedding or a cock fight ?
What do you have to get out of your bag ?
What is it ?
Back off !
I &apos;m at the business bottom
Y@@ up . That &apos;s what would happen next .
People are placing bet@@ s that I &apos;m hal@@ f@@ way to Ren@@ o
They came sm@@ elling like that din@@ er cheese
We look just like S@@ ophie ! I am so relie@@ ved .
O@@ leg , stop looking at us like that .
You guys look like the Four T@@ ops .
O@@ leg , S@@ ophie doesn &apos;t want you to see her .
And Ch@@ est@@ nut , I &apos;m sorry , baby .
And , H@@ an , you &apos;re supposed to take this
What do you think , girls ?
Oh , listen ! I heard the tu@@ ba . That &apos;s my cue !
Her dress almost killed us
Since your lawyer called US ,
We feel the same way .
It &apos;s got to be a mistake .
M@@ om !
I can &apos;t wear red with these shoes ! U@@ gh !
Yes , Carlos Soli@@ s loved his wife .... .
Oh , that &apos;s ok@@ ay , swe@@ e@@ tie .
You can have one of these by working very hard ...
Thank you !
I thought we &apos;d be here at least for a year .
But why buy ... . that one ?
Es@@ Cr@@ O@@ w &apos;s closed , Bet@@ h .
How did I not know this ?
The girls are meeting for poker . I &apos;ll be back in a few .
No . I &apos;m really just doing a dri@@ ve-@@ by .
Why don &apos;t you just leave her with me ?
But we usually play for a couple of hours .
You seem to be bo@@ unc@@ ing back just fine .
When your friend called ,
is this friend named Ren@@ ee ?
I wish I had a friend like that .
What we need is for you to let us be who we are .
Good@@ b@@ ye , gab@@ y .
You said I had a month .
It &apos;s the Internet . Everything moves very fast .
They talked about a big ad campaign ,
Get them to stop it , or at least put some other girl up there .
And they &apos;ll agree not to put them up ,
I talked them down from $ 12@@ ,000 .
I mean , it puts US right back where we were
And what &apos;s Mike gon@@ na say when he no@@ tices
Maybe I should just let them put up the b@@ ill@@ boards .
You know , there is another way .
How d@@ are you explo@@ it a traum@@ atic childhood memory .
Oh , look . He followed you home .
About the same as when he finds out
Why don &apos;t we ask him who he wants to be with ?
Put him on the spot like that .
Is that a hot flash or you just losing your ner@@ ve ?
Everything ok@@ ay here ?
Can we ask you something ?
Forest green or brown
We usually just take N@@ ancy around
Par@@ don me , may I get past ?
I don &apos;t know what to do .
You know , my cat can &apos;t get this open either .
R@@ ich , funny , and in a suit at 9 : 00 A.@@ M. ?
You know , my cat , Dick@@ ens , loves your cat .
Dick@@ ens , after the author , Max .
The guy who wrote Mu@@ pp@@ ets Christmas Car@@ ol .
So I let her in . I hope that &apos;s ok@@ ay .
I hope your girlfriend didn &apos;t mind .
And I better get going .
Max , give the man his case .
She doesn &apos;t want to get out of c@@ ush@@ y this thing .
Well , here &apos;s my card , just give me a call
A card , a meeting , a suit , a jo@@ ke ?
Well , thank you , O@@ wen Charles Bo@@ y@@ d ,
She &apos;s jo@@ king , she &apos;s just not as funny as you .
Ok@@ ay .
But I was doing it for our business .
And it &apos;s not for medical mari@@ ju@@ ana .
That &apos;s the kind of fat cat
H@@ ey , girls .
I knew she &apos;d come back pregnant .

Let &apos;s go .
How many cards do you want ?
E@@ than , just calm down .

I think it &apos;s important that S@@ ophie knows what &apos;s going on .
Would everybody just tell me what we &apos;re talking about ?
It &apos;s nothing
He didn &apos;t go to the gro@@ cer@@ y store .
I can &apos;t fu@@ cking pre@@ tend to be you .. I am me .

How else do you think I land@@ ed
I &apos;m sorry .
I was very close to my neighb@@ ors , the Kl@@ eins .
Stop now .
We &apos;ll just get our money and go .
What are we , barb@@ arians ?
But , out here in the kitchen , away from the men .
Three of my favorite things to do .
Had@@ ass@@ a , hand me a spo@@ on .

And they &apos;re back .
That &apos;s right .
Pre@@ ach !

Y@@ o , don &apos;t get all je@@ al@@ ous , van@@ illa cone .
How would you like it if I told your mother
Dam@@ n , son !
Don &apos;t say anything to her .
Max , she should know .
Just keep it to yourself for five minutes and we &apos;re gone .
Ma , this is Max who made the kos@@ her c@@ up@@ cakes .
Max , what are you talking about ?
Yes , well , maybe my rab@@ bi didn &apos;t have such high standards .
So close .
Yes , you told me about tradition and family .
And she was nice enough to put it on my head
I like a party as much as the next man ,
Oh , Shel@@ don , we don &apos;t need a meeting every three months .
Lu@@ cky for you it &apos;s tomorrow .
Well , you have to go .
This meeting is a waste of time .
You realize one of them has sugar on the ra@@ is@@ ins .
And yet you get to wei@@ gh in .
Well , we &apos;ll just see about that .
He says he &apos;s not coming to the Ro@@ omm@@ ate Agreement meeting tomorrow .
You have fun . I will not be atten@@ ding .
Meeting .
Which means I &apos;m gon@@ na have to Google &quot; How to play catch . &quot;
you know how guys are .
I mean , look at me .
Don &apos;t get too f@@ ond of this character . &quot;
Ye@@ ah , but I won &apos;t say who it is .
Wa@@ it , what is going on ?
As long as I don &apos;t have to watch with him .
I &apos;ll go over here .
From A@@ my .
Because you were def@@ ending Shel@@ don like you always do .
Oh , yes , you do . You know you have a wei@@ rd
That &apos;s different .
Um , guys ?
Your infections , you mean .
And you didn &apos;t even do that right .
I can afford any hospital in the world ,
I &apos;ve been here for three weeks .
Dis@@ charge her , please . I &apos;ll pay you .
Now get me ou@@ tt@@ a here before I sue your balls off .
Give me a number .
After we inform Mr. Beck@@ ert &apos;s family ,
Oh , it doesn &apos;t matter . I &apos;m gon@@ na shut it down , pending the aut@@ op@@ sy .
I thought Dr@@ .@@ B@@ ail@@ ey said Tor@@ res can &apos;t be moved yet .
I think it &apos;ll do the both of them good .
Why do you even ask me these things , hu@@ h ?
I need your help with something .
It was never opened , so it needs to go back into the lot .
I heard about your patient . I &apos;m sorry .
Have a good night .
Henry , will you open the door ?
My super cute te@@ e !
Right up there with the b@@ ong with a ch@@ in stra@@ p

He &apos;s a great k@@ id , isn &apos;t he ?
Sometimes , I feel like a hy@@ pe@@ d-@@ up

You said , you , you said , &quot; Go ! Take some time . &quot;
Every@@ body at home is bl@@ aming me , y@@ elling at me ,
All that matters is what &apos;s happening to you .
All I have ever done is try to help you .
Ex@@ ac@@ tly ! Bingo ! Par@@ tri@@ dge in a pe@@ ar tree !

How many people wear g@@ ing@@ er@@ bread de@@ odor@@ ant ?
&quot; No@@ elle , I know I was angry ,
Which still makes it my best Christmas in a long time .
Wa@@ it , so you believe what I told you ?
But to get out of here , stop talking about the North Pol@@ e ,
See ?
These things happen .
The question is , what really makes a Santa ?
No@@ elle , can you insp@@ ire us ?
I used to think Christmas was the best day of the year .
It should say there , in the file .
A long time .
When did you start ?
I was a dr@@ unk
How do you feel about the girl ?
Which was ? Why ?
We face these decisions every day , and we vote up or down .
To determine whether you are fit to remain in the field .

Stop walking around on your leg .
We &apos;re Clear
Oh , my God , it &apos;s David .

Grab that . Let &apos;s go .

Where are you going ?
I &apos;m stuck here with you . Ye@@ ah .

What do you mean &quot; how does it matter &quot;
M@@ mm@@ -@@ h@@ mm ... This is all you &apos;ve got .
You &apos;re on the other side of the fu@@ cking numbers .
You think you &apos;re not a part of this , hu@@ h ?
What &apos;s wrong with you ? What are you doing here ?
No , you can live a long time like this .
Can you take the bul@@ let out ?

Not enough oxygen for it to burn .
C@@ ould be worse .
Well , they could send us to Hill 60 .
Mess@@ ines Rid@@ ge , just across the border , near Wi@@ pers &apos; .
Still don &apos;t know what I heard , but .
Maybe I never heard no Germans .
Don &apos;t make no difference .
Oh , bloo@@ dy generous of &apos; em .
Prob@@ ably not a good idea , Cor@@ p .
We was ready to give up on you , P@@ ull Through .
Well , we was .
Fin@@ ish your letter , W@@ alt , or get some more sh@@ ut@@ -@@ eye .
And that &apos;s why we kept dig@@ ging .
And how much explo@@ sive charge would you need to demo@@ lish that building ?
How much would you need to do the job properly ?
Do we have that in the stores or do we have to requ@@ isition it ?
There &apos;s a listening post at 105 Drive .
If we drove north from there ,
Let &apos;s have it done before sun@@ -up , 0@@ 400 .

Ke@@ eping the water out was their main problem .
Now it &apos;s ours .
Right below German lines .
The blue clay of Flan@@ ders .
Major North , 3rd Canadian T@@ unn@@ ellers .
He can &apos;t get at us . Oh no no no .
I &apos;ve never seen anything like this before .
500 feet down there is a c@@ ater@@ pillar mine .
There &apos;s 21 of them .
You know , when this thing b@@ lows
All we have to do is keep the bloo@@ dy thing dry
He thinks we &apos;re dig@@ ging well@@ s .
Water se@@ eps down , pools above the clay .
We have 60 blo@@ kes man@@ ning the pumps night and day
Where did they get this lot ?
Yes , when it came to a crisis ,
Even if B@@ ree herself would have preferred to be a passenger .
What am I supposed to do ?
Well , apparently , Jane doesn &apos;t play by the same rules .
Can you believe this guy ?
Ye@@ ah . That &apos;s a healthy attitude .
B@@ ows of fruit .
As a matter of fact , I did .
Ok@@ ay , again , as a former teacher ,

You can &apos;t promise that , Carlos .
Nothing &apos;s happened . Rel@@ ax .

T@@ old you I saw a lion .
Is this about Crist@@ ina again ?
I wish I could take it back .
Oh , qu@@ it it . Stop thinking about the hot or@@ th@@ o nur@@ se .

What happened then ?
I sho@@ ved my arm right into his mouth .
Who the hell fe@@ eds himself to a lion ?
What do we got ?
Ye@@ ah , that &apos;s what you expect when you hear &quot; lion . &quot;
She never bo@@ ther@@ ed to mention she had a pet lion ?
So I dis@@ s@@ ect out and remove the animal c@@ ad@@ aver hearts .
Cor@@ rec@@ t . And why do we do that ?
Like stri@@ pping a house down to its frame only .
We are wi@@ ping them clean ,
when we in@@ ject them with stem cells ...
Let &apos;s grow ourselves some new hearts .
But you &apos;re still a student ,
Are you gon@@ na tell Mark to move in with Julia ?
We don &apos;t talk about stuff like this .
You &apos;re not using the oil .
We &apos;re only in town till tomorrow .
Mr. Car@@ roll , you &apos;re experiencing a heart attack .
Can you tell me what you were doing
And it was like a piano fell
You weren &apos;t running or anything else
We saw a lion .

But every year , they demand more .
More interesting subjects .
Last year , they had college athletes ..

What I &apos;m saying , exactly , is if we &apos;re going to go on
Where the fu@@ ck is all my money ?
I been meaning to sort out my properties for a@@ while now .
Being a land@@ lord is not to everyone &apos;s taste , running a pu@@ b ,
It &apos;s a lovely five bedroom flat up@@ stairs
You &apos;re welcome R@@ ita .
Charles thought you were Jack Bos@@ by ,
Sorry Jack .
C@@ ame to visit you in hospital the first time ,
We were having a fight when he ...
Hon@@ ey , the doctors here are great .
You have nothing to worry about .
But I am trying hard to be strong ,
Then we won &apos;t comfort .
I know you &apos;re not a child ,
Why should you f@@ end for yourself
What kind of fre@@ ak are you ? Just leave me alone .
I told you that I am fine . Stop acting like my mother and go home .
Your father &apos;s not coming back .
The girls and I were talking and we think maybe Paul Young killed Mrs. Hu@@ ber
How can we move forward if you won &apos;t communicate with me ?
Gab@@ by , thank God you &apos;re doing this .
Yes , well , Carlos , in some circles ,
I &apos;m about to be the mother of your child ,
you &apos;re going to get up , without saying one word .
He &apos;s a good person .
So don &apos;t m@@ ess this up .
My marriage is a bit stra@@ ined .
No one &apos;s been convic@@ ted yet , Mrs. Soli@@ s . This is just a grand jury hearing .
Oh . Right .
Any@@ ways , he was placed under house arrest
Well , I didn &apos;t exactly ease his mind .
Before Carlos &apos; house arrest , he was always working and he was never with me .
he would realize he loved me .
Is there a point to this ?
She did some terrible , crazy , sel@@ fish stuff .
If &apos;s complicated .
And just like that , my husband began sharing my secrets .
Secre@@ ts I had died to protect .
Hello .
Nice to meet you . Ir@@ ina .
Oh , she &apos;s more than a friend , mo@@ m . We &apos;re in love .
She wants nothing to do with your son .
H@@ ey , this is An@@ a . Leave a message .
Dro@@ p dead .
ason V@@ ale Cot@@ ton
Well , I am sorry you don &apos;t appreciate him .
In fact , I have decided to give him a promotion .
Vice president .
Well , a company can have more than one .
Are we done sharing ?
Wo@@ w . So Paris , Prague , Madrid ...
But you still haven &apos;t told US how you two met .
You know , if you &apos;re right , she &apos;ll move on soon enough .
I need to talk to you guys .
I proposed to Ir@@ ina , and she said yes .
You proposed ?
Ye@@ ah . But she &apos;s the one . I know it .
It &apos;s not the fe@@ ds I &apos;m wor@@ ried about .
Patrick Log@@ an ?
That &apos;s how he &apos;ll find me .
Patrick Log@@ an does not care about you .
Ma , please .
Rob@@ in the stri@@ pper ?
Oh , oh , sorry . I was just , u@@ h , showing my support .
Andrew , is that beer ?
It &apos;s ok@@ ay . If &apos;s ok@@ ay . I &apos;ve got this .
Why don &apos;t we not ? Oh , besides ,
Andrew !
I &apos;m fine .
Does Sam Allen live here ?
Oh . Then I gu@@ ess I &apos;ll just , u@@ h , le@@ e these on his por@@ ch .
Put it inside . If &apos;s un@@ locked .
What are you doing with a picture of Re@@ x ?
He was my father .
This is not how I wanted you to find out . I am so sorry .
Ir@@ ina really loved the ring , M@@ om . That &apos;s why she wanted
You sure ? N@@ ana &apos;s ring is worth a lot more
But I want your mother to know
He was single , so was she .
When she found out she was pregnant , she called him .
He offered to support her finan@@ cially ,
Just tell her I can &apos;t come .
She &apos;s 93 .
No , hang on . I followed all the proto@@ col@@ s
I checked the ti@@ re pressure on the car .
F@@ Y@@ I , it &apos;s none .
You use it to get your way .
The fact that the right way is also my way
You &apos;re coming with me .
Women like a firm hand on the til@@ ler .
I got a book ; it didn &apos;t help .
Now , I downloaded an app that
I &apos;m smart as a w@@ hip .
H@@ ey , listen , I kind of made plans
Do whatever you want .
Re@@ ally , what were you hop@@ ing for ?
And that would turn you on a little .
Do you mind if I spend the weekend
You mean I wouldn &apos;t see you at all ?
No , no ..
You can &apos;t put a s@@ addle on Leon@@ ard Hof@@ stad@@ ter .
Back in O@@ ma@@ ha , there are two different restaurants
You &apos;re in charge of healing all of us , not just Howard .
Ye@@ ah , I don &apos;t think saving people is really for us .
They &apos;ll do it for free .
Five thousand up front .
This is what I &apos;m talking about . Clean lines , nothing to profile .
What I &apos;m talking about , S@@ al , is you transpor@@ ting anything and everything
But we got@@ ta talk about our cut .
You know , I just remembered something . I need batteries and toilet paper .
The one where he turns back into a fu@@ cking baby ?
I wonder where I could get all these items in one convenient location ?
I &apos;m gon@@ na start using that sh@@ it .
.. look at my future empire as the Wal@@ m@@ art of bot@@ tom@@ -@@ dollar retail crime .
That &apos;s my job .
And I don &apos;t need a partner .
Co@@ inci@@ dentally , where I found you .
I really appreciate all the sh@@ it you &apos;ve done for me , you know ,
See , partnership leads to ambi@@ tion .
Mut@@ iny .
It &apos;s bad news .
Did you happen to mention that kid@@ n@@ apping ain &apos;t exactly what we do ?
You was at church ?
Bull sheet . What the catch ?
His voice box was cr@@ ushed when he was a k@@ id . He can &apos;t talk .
He &apos;s the baby of the bro@@ od . He was well on his way
Who@@ o !
Like I said , I know all .
Well , you can if some suit
Once this thing gets wra@@ pped up , I &apos;ll get out of your hair .
We &apos;ll be in Dallas by mid@@ night .
Can you believe she went ahead and paid us five grand up front ?
I mean , you &apos;d think she &apos;d have some trust issues , right ?
Well , if he &apos;s a baby , they got baby j@@ unk up there .
It &apos;s not like they &apos;re riding around
Why are you asking me so many
How will we know which is Ro@@ b ? I &apos;m gon@@ na say which one &apos;s Ro@@ b !
I don &apos;t want Michael ! No , I don &apos;t want Stephen ! &quot;
We sm@@ ash wh@@ o@@ ever &apos;s in front of us and we take Ro@@ b !
I mean it , Bri@@ ck . I better not hear sh@@ it about your little Texas job .

All right , let &apos;s get her inside .
A b@@ ony de@@ formity in the tempor@@ al region .
Ab@@ dom@@ en &apos;s clear .
Starting to regre@@ t taking that tour of the city today .
Th@@ ought it was a good idea .
Ye@@ ah , h@@ ey , Dr. War@@ ren here .
.. But we &apos;re gon@@ na get you fixed up .
Ye@@ ah , sure . I &apos;ll hold .
This should help with the pain .
Ok@@ ay ? I do , in fact , know that , L@@ ou . I grew up here .
Where &apos;s ne@@ uro ?
Put in a central line .
Oh , ok@@ ay .
We got some left kne@@ e sw@@ elling .
Is there another way out ?
I don &apos;t want to do this .
Ok@@ ay .
I mean , she needs to worry about staying out of her fu@@ cking refrigerator .
She &apos;s losing a huge war against the refrigerator .
She needs to find the fu@@ cking tre@@ ad@@ mill .
Well , she should mind her business .
That &apos;s why I don &apos;t come here .
Take the second one on the left .
I &apos;m just , u@@ h ... Happy Th@@ ank@@ s@@ giving .
And also because my sister told me
when we were married .
Hav@@ en &apos;t heard from you for a while , so ...
Th@@ ought I &apos;d give you a call and see how you &apos;re doing .
Hello , Jack , this is Father Edward Dev@@ ine calling from Bishop Ha@@ yes High School .
Ye@@ ah , big time .
Let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go , let &apos;s go !
Here we go , here we go .
Next time 32 goes over your back like that , put a fu@@ cking el@@ bow in his stomach .
And if Chil@@ dress tries to put you on a poster like that ,
Have a little fu@@ cking pride .
We don &apos;t take any plays off , we don &apos;t let &apos; em brea@@ the .
Even if the ball &apos;s in the middle of the court ?
You can &apos;t tra@@ p if the ball &apos;s in the middle of the floor . You need the si@@ del@@ ine .
Get up !
Pres@@ sure , pressure . Don &apos;t let him brea@@ the .
Tra@@ p , tra@@ p , tra@@ p !
No ! Bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it !
Rob@@ b@@ ins can take that case .
Well , I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s about to get harder .
H.@@ R. ?
Oh , god .
And that might be the end of it .
I have no time for this today .
H@@ ey , Der@@ ek ! Are you coming by the lab today ?
Ye@@ ah . Actually , they &apos;re setting up my new office today .
The guys are going to duplic@@ ate one .
All right . Here .
The clu@@ b-@@ feet girl ? She &apos;s back ?
Oh , y@@ e@@ ah . Ok@@ ay .
The an@@ onymous har@@ ass@@ ment claim came from Le@@ ah Mur@@ phy .
Ye@@ ah . Thank you . M@@ m-@@ h@@ mm .
No , I have not .
Oh , I think I &apos;d want a cardi@@ ac c@@ ath
Look , it &apos;s closing up already .
Um , pre@@ p a ballo@@ on cath@@ eter .
I don &apos;t know .
This is like a puzzle .
The valve le@@ af@@ lets were thick@@ ened and shor@@ tened .
Not a child whose legs
And hon@@ est@@ ly . I mean , before last year ,
It &apos;s about Al@@ y@@ ss@@ a . It &apos;s not about me .
Why would you say that it &apos;s not about me ?
I want to ask you about something ,
You can ask .
That &apos;s a question ?
It wasn &apos;t .
because I didn &apos;t want you to .
Good .
Like I &apos;m telling you how you were supposed to feel .
Re@@ ally ?
You don &apos;t have to get Sh@@ ep@@ herd coffee
And when you look back in 10 years ,
Oh , shut up . You will . You better .
That should be you down there .
Wo@@ w . I &apos;ve got to go up to H.@@ R. to fill out an accident report .
For h@@ itting Jackson with a gur@@ ney .
Rob@@ b@@ ins should be here to see this .
App@@ endi@@ x is holding .
M@@ om , I &apos;m b@@ ailing on our trip !
A man named Ni@@ gel P@@ ickl@@ es
Stop !
Cle@@ arly , you all have bad news to tell me .
Oh , my God , you did !
The one hour a month when I am a human to you people .
Let me tell you something .
And no , I &apos;m not trying to gu@@ ilt you .
Cla@@ ire
No drinking !
If M@@ om starts to think the monster sounds familiar ,
De@@ de ? What are you doing here ?
I &apos;m sorry to bar@@ ge in .
Oh , so you &apos;re the one who gets to choose the grant winner .
And they &apos;re all a good candidate .
and she &apos;s very pas@@ sionate about the candidates .
I better get going .
So , where &apos;s your son ?
He &apos;s been doing some consulting work for the ... . government .
And metal dra@@ g@@ ging over the rocks ,
P@@ unc@@ ture , spar@@ k , boo@@ m .
Me@@ ans the driver didn &apos;t pump the bra@@ kes
That &apos;s gas@@ oline .
There &apos;s a de@@ br@@ is trail here .
G@@ ot something here .
I think I have another piece of it here , Nick .
He had a little help .
Ok@@ ay .
That means that the k@@ iller was on campus .
I found nit@@ rates on the bom@@ b frag@@ ments
Exc@@ ept those devices were more sophisticated .
The cur@@ ved shape would have given the bl@@ ast
L@@ ooks like you got a hit .
L@@ ooks like our b@@ ell@@ -@@ shaped charge
I got one of those .
Are you guys all right ?
You ok@@ ay ?
The par@@ ame@@ dic@@ s took Julia Hol@@ den to the hospital ,
place a package on her desk .
Well , we already know that Michael
Ye@@ ah .... y@@ e@@ ah , maybe enough to pin this on Michael .
L@@ ooks like the bom@@ b was
package bom@@ bs are rig@@ ged to explo@@ de when you open them ,
I find it so hard to believe
Do you know what this means ?
It &apos;s Que@@ bec Sign Language .
Thank you very much . It &apos;s ok@@ ay .
It actually measures your brain &apos;s response to sound .
You acted as though you didn &apos;t hear them ,
You &apos;re not de@@ af , Se@@ an . You &apos;re a fraud .
Se@@ an Wy@@ att still isn I talking ,
And if Dr. Lam@@ bert found out that he was a fraud ,
His real name is Se@@ an W@@ v@@ att Leb@@ lan@@ c ,
My career has been my life .
We .... we all have this need
He was using me .
Is there anything that you know about Se@@ an ?
Where can I find this guy ?
This
The gr@@ ate and bars are weak ,
We do it in the day ,
Now , in the yard tomorrow , there &apos;s a so@@ cc@@ er game at 2 : 00 .
And yesterday when we were dig@@ ging ,
It &apos;s not much of a break .
It &apos;s not going to be easy .
We don &apos;t want a real road that &apos;s not an option .
Your brother &apos;s cutting it close .
Tom@@ orrow &apos;s Wednesday , you didn &apos;t leave much room for error .
Let &apos;s get this done .
Your cell should provide
Look for that gl@@ are , see if it shows up again .
Wat@@ ching the other tower from here .
When &apos;d you meet your boy@@ friend , W@@ hi@@ st@@ ler ?
I worked in this place in San Is@@ abel .
H@@ itting on the wa@@ it@@ ress . That &apos;s romantic .
His mother lives there in a retirement home .
Out of the car , Juan Bob@@ o
I was just about to .
Yes , si@@ r .
On the other side , when we get out of here ,
And then they &apos;re gon@@ na kill me .
If they wanted to kill you .
I don &apos;t see why they keep me alive .
Once I give it to them , I &apos;ll be no use to them .
I don &apos;t have all the answers .
Let &apos;s go .
So what do we do now ?
Well , I &apos;m afraid that &apos;s not good enough .
W@@ ast@@ ing time is not an option for me , Michael .
I need to re@@ trace my steps .
just , just leave me alone , please .
They know the name of everyone I care about
If you can &apos;t get me out of here , tell me now .
Hu@@ h ?
Ye@@ ah .
You know my brother and I wanted to come
To@@ o much bad stuff &apos;s happened .
It &apos;s only gon@@ na work if if W@@ hi@@ st@@ ler co@@ operates .
Like my n@@ ana .
Sweet mercy ! Without R@@ alp@@ h , we &apos;re do@@ om@@ ed !
Ok@@ ay , everybody , calm down .
See ? There he is now .
No , well , y@@ e@@ ah . I mean , not from right in this area .

You probably want to stand back .
Who &apos;s &quot; we &quot; ?
Oh ! Where is everybody else ?
So you just meant like the royal &quot; we &quot; ?
H@@ ey , are you a ho@@ bo ?
Ok@@ ay ? So you go home .
Your breath is so bad it made my ears num@@ b .
I tried to be nice .
And bring that thing to my castle .
Or@@ -@@ e-@@ oh O@@ re@@ o !
M@@ m-@@ k@@ ay .
Ye@@ ah . Who are you , the guy that makes the don@@ uts ?
I see you &apos;re a fan of pink .
What are you doing here ?
Your medal ? Bad guys don &apos;t win med@@ als .
I earned it over in Her@@ o &apos;s Dut@@ y .
R@@ alp@@ h , you &apos;re not going Turbo , are you ?
Because if you think you can come in here to my kingdom
&quot; Children of the cand@@ y corn &quot; ? Who &apos;d ..
The coin she used to buy her way into the race .
She did what ? I need that back !
It &apos;s nothing but code now .
Maybe I &apos;ll have to have a little talk
F@@ unge@@ on ?
It &apos;s the ..
Good@@ b@@ ye , W@@ re@@ ck-@@ it R@@ alp@@ h ! It has@@ n &apos;t been a pleasure .
I can see that .
Oh , Van@@ ello@@ pe , it &apos;s so ... You .

Ye@@ ah , well , King Cand@@ y says gli@@ t@@ ches can &apos;t race .
Please !
You will never be a rac@@ er because you &apos;re a gli@@ t@@ ch .
H@@ ey ! Leave her alone !
What are you looking at ?
I &apos;m not a th@@ ief ! I just bor@@ ro@@ wed your st@@ up@@ id coin .
It &apos;s not a coin . It is a medal
I can &apos;t . I didn &apos;t win it in my game .
Hu@@ h .
Leave me alone .
So here &apos;s what I &apos;m thinking .
And I &apos;ll win the race and get you back your medal .
All you got to do is break something for me .
We are not friends .
Come on , bud@@ dy . Let &apos;s sha@@ ke on it .
H@@ ey !
You better win .
There &apos;s the shuttle .
N@@ ope . Lu@@ cky for him .
No C@@ y-@@ Bu@@ g , either .
It came this way ,
So what is it with this W@@ re@@ ck-@@ It j@@ ok@@ er ?
I wish I knew , ma &apos;@@ am .
But I never thought he &apos;d go Turbo .
That &apos;s right , you guys just got plu@@ gged in .
And Turbo .. Turbo
What is wrong with her ?
You two still haven &apos;t figured out this machine ?
I &apos;m good with this kind of stuff .
H@@ ey , H@@ an &apos;s a man , according to recent l@@ ore .
Ok@@ ay , let &apos;s see . Here &apos;s the steam one .
It burned my neck !
Lu@@ ck@@ ily you &apos;re not t@@ aller .
That c@@ app@@ u@@ cc@@ ino machine might have just
I &apos;m sorry , O@@ leg . S@@ ophie &apos;s moved on .
Ye@@ ah , but not in your neighborhood .
She had the dec@@ ency to do it on a st@@ oop in St@@ aten Island .
We were going to travel the world together .
H@@ ey , what &apos;s this area back there ?
I should check it out .
Is O@@ leg in here ?
That delicious mix of man and butter .
Oh , honey , I could &apos;ve told you that .
Wa@@ it till you see what happens
I don &apos;t work for you .
Oh , I have to get this .
But we used to have the same machine
No , I am not working at St@@ arb@@ u@@ cks .
Just for two hours .
T@@ amp it in , pack it down , turn it on .
Hon@@ est@@ ly , all I heard was group head .
Place the steam wand hal@@ f@@ way in the pit@@ cher
Sy@@ ru@@ ps , pow@@ ders , whi@@ pped cream is right here .
I think I can handle it . I went to Wh@@ art@@ on .
That &apos;s not what I said .
Girl , you &apos;re good at this .
I am good . I think I &apos;m getting the hang of this .
Or Ohio .
I &apos;ll have a tall dri@@ p , extra hot .
I &apos;d say it &apos;s pretty obvious .
Why ?
Ch@@ ania , please ?
It is safe here .
You got any food for him ?
And why were you trying to take out Kan@@ iel Ou@@ tis ?
You weren &apos;t supposed to .
I &apos;ll tell you everything you want to know .
I@@ can have you prosec@@ uted .
You &apos;re not calling him junior , are you ?
He &apos;s an amazing k@@ id .
He was tigh@@ tening his control over me ,
When I knew Pos@@ ei@@ don had gone ro@@ gue
He &apos;s not gon@@ na hurt Mike .
If you remove his mask ,
That &apos;s the point , no one knows him .
You play his game . You wear your own mask .
I &apos;ll get to the states as soon as I can .
Ye@@ ah ?
A nav@@ al alert just went out .
It was reported by the ship &apos;s captain .
R@@ an into a few bodies :
Back in the good old days , when the Mo@@ b really knew
Inter@@ esting pattern to this wo@@ und .
Well , it &apos;s an L-@@ shaped wo@@ und , so , not a rock .
Well , maybe there was a struggle at the edge of the water .
Shirt &apos;s tor@@ n .
So , calculated PM@@ I is four to seven hours .
Gu@@ y &apos;s out here in the middle of no@@ where
And who was he with ?
Fo@@ und a bloo@@ dy print on the inside of the box .
It &apos;s all go@@ at &apos;s blood ?
But in the meantime , the print &apos;s pretty good .
You got to see this .
You sure ?
See there ?
Sorry . Hav@@ en &apos;t gotten that far yet .
Well , maybe his neighb@@ or &apos;s got the rest of your bil@@ ly go@@ at .
You think he killed Walter Bur@@ ns
I &apos;ll run the print .
Gas company &apos;s drilling right in his lap .
No pri@@ ors . He &apos;s been here for 40 years .
Well , if his prints are on that box ,
I didn &apos;t see any li@@ vest@@ ock .
No oil le@@ ak .
Let &apos;s see if Mr. Gi@@ b@@ son &apos;s here .
We only want to understand what &apos;s going on .
Let me show you .
I don &apos;t mean to ins@@ ult your intelligence ,
The Cu@@ y@@ ah@@ oga , just outside of Cle@@ vel@@ and .
Did you know they were both sick ?
Have you seen your doctor recently ?
You can read about it in my article .
Unfortunately , all my sources keep dying on me .
Have you ever heard of &quot; Fra@@ cking &quot; ?
Look it up .
Very well .
Good .
Ye@@ ah .
I analyzed the sample we collected from Mr. Gi@@ b@@ son &apos;s well .
I pulled the clinical aut@@ op@@ sy reports
This is the analysis from the water found
So Walter Bur@@ ns
We need to war@@ n people .
A water sample from one well
What ?
Then they pump millions of gall@@ ons of water , sand
So they &apos;re drilling right through the aqu@@ i@@ fer in Cable Springs ,
The valve &apos;s loose , about a quarter turn .
I think som@@ ebo@@ dy set up our tru@@ cker Co@@ dy Tri@@ m@@ ble
Tri@@ m@@ ble gets out to fix his ti@@ re ,
This wasn &apos;t an accident .
And what looks like some hair .
I think we know what made Walter Bur@@ ns &apos; head wo@@ und .
But what he got was a Ber@@ etta to the head .
Co@@ dy Tri@@ m@@ ble drove Walter &apos;s body out to the hot springs .
Right . So ...
That &apos;s some serious company loyalty .
That &apos;s it . Case closed .
You &apos;re going to let some corporate law@@ yers
You got your evidence . You got the bad guy .
Well , we still need a water sample
Because Walter Bur@@ ns dro@@ w@@ ned in
K@@ iller &apos;s dead .
Well , Leon@@ ard and Penn@@ y are our best friends .
They said it &apos;s the perfect gift .
You don &apos;t ..
Don &apos;t be sil@@ ly .
Do you think when Kr@@ yp@@ to the Super@@ dog is out flying ,
No@@ body &apos;s gon@@ na die
L@@ ate , and with an attitude .
Of course she thinks that .
Well , what other career option do you have , Carol@@ ine ?
No , wait , your shop didn &apos;t last six months .
Oh , I &apos;m already there . And now I &apos;m back .
And we have to tell them to stop
And now they &apos;re not making noise .
It &apos;s Max and Carol@@ ine .
Hi . Ye@@ ah , it &apos;s not a good time .
and , obviously , I &apos;m Be@@ y@@ once .
Look at all the single ladies .
J@@ ay Z and I have a lot in common .
Where should I put this ?
Put it anywhere You want .
Look , you two may be crazy in love ,
Oh , come on . We &apos;re not in love .
Oh , no , you &apos;re right .
Is it really a reward if it comes from CV@@ S ?
Or are all the lan@@ es reserved ?
Wa@@ it , you &apos;ve never been to O@@ leg &apos;s apartment ?
You &apos;d be surprised by my apartment , S@@ ophie .
Ye@@ ah , well , That sounds nice .
Any advice or p@@ ills ?
And you didn &apos;t use my college fund
But if that didn &apos;t work ,
Carol@@ ine Will be at O@@ leg &apos;s .
The last time I was st@@ oned
Look at us , Max ,
Oh , it &apos;s this way .
Now , what movie should we watch ?
Is there one where Sh@@ re@@ k has cancer ?
What is Carol@@ ine doing here ?
I am at O@@ leg &apos;s .
You told him this was our apartment ?
I &apos;m not let@@ ting anyone leave
Are we not smoking we@@ ed ?
I don &apos;t know what his problem is .
Why doesn &apos;t he fire himself for missing pu@@ ber@@ ty ?
She spent her morning du@@ sting a stra@@ p-@@ on .
and now this p@@ ig is as cold as your family is gon@@ na be
My dad does not like to be por@@ k te@@ ased .
The attraction was immediate .
We dated for six months .
And then , he suddenly disappeared .
Just some pe@@ an@@ ut sh@@ ells on the floor
