Two guys walk in , one walks out .
But , for now , it &apos;s done .
Everybody from Chief Soto to the FBI to the whole goddamn world
Just something I saw on oil projects in Saudi .
Hang on , what ?
When it got in range of a cell tower , it would start phoning home .
Did the Hunters put a cell-based tracker
Hey. listen , can you check with a cell phone company ,
Are they gonna run it down ?
But , Christ , Jenny , that &apos;s amazing .
Well , if he had a name , he &apos;d be mine .
Hey . Hey , wake up .
Shit .
It must be far from the tower
Nobody &apos;s got the manpower to search that many storage yards .
Look , to hell with downtown and the feds .
We &apos;re here to help you finish this , Sean .
Thanks .
Did you bring the sugar ?
I just came here for one thing .
I &apos;m sorry about your Uncle Brian .
No ! I have a reputation .
Okay , so how were they gonna
Why would they talk to me about that ?
Oh . They don &apos;t speak the language of fire .
Yeah , you and I don &apos;t speak the same language .
You love to speak with the dragon . So do I .
Hi , another me .
How are they getting the package out of Chicago ?
Nothing . Okay ?
God damn it .
All right . What story ?
But enough that both fires turned on each other , away from the building
And yet Wicek was still consumed .
So here &apos;s my question .
Did you want him to burn ?
You have no idea .
I do .
Those two men with the pretend names ,
Given the Kelvin required for ignition was minimal .
Ah . Oh , you &apos;ll need to find a battery for it , and I was never here .
Just keep those dead kids off my desk , huh ?
There you are .
Come on , come on , come on .
Surprise , surprise . No diversion blast today .
Hey ! Show me your hands ! Show me your fucking hands !
Come on ! Show me your fucking hands .
Keep coming . Walk towards me . Walk towards me !
Keep those hands where I can see them .
You &apos;re both under arrest ...
Yep . You &apos;re up for carpool .
Have you ever seen AIDS ?
Besides , Tammy &apos;s mom says that all the AIDS are in New York ...
Let &apos;s just stick to science , okay ?
We do have vials of HIV ,
You &apos;ve seen something worse ?
I work in one of the safest places in the world .
Morning , ma &apos;am .
Hey .
Ah , what do we have here ?
Hazleton .
Yep . Well , hello , Monkey 053 .
It looks like a spleen .
What &apos;s wrong ?
uh , a blood clot , I think .
What would cause that ?
And , if this is a primate , it &apos;s probably SHF .
Simian Hemorrhagic Fever .
Where ever this guy came from ,
It rips the hell out of the inside of monkeys ,
If this monkey has Simian Fever , you &apos;re looking for
I never know how to decipher your level of sarcasm .
kind of like a Level 3 ?
Stick with acerbic .
Code Three . Medical tear , lock two .
Whatever it is , it didn &apos;t get me .
I &apos;m observing blood in the powder .
Sir , we have a duty to warn Hazleton .
I don &apos;t even know where to start .
Well , there you go .
I already have the lab
The package was for my study .
I &apos;ve already told Hazleton that it &apos;s Simian Fever .
in there has two rare and deadly diseases ?
They sent us samples of SHF , which I &apos;ve been expecting for weeks ,
No , that .. that &apos;s experience .
Look , enough of this crap , okay ?
I was about to introduce Ebola Zaire to the sample tissue .
All your samples were compromised during sterilization , ma &apos;am .
All right , one second . Excuse me .
Well , fantastic !
Can you pick up the kids this afternoon ?
I can &apos;t afford those places , not the good ones .
Boy ...
You can walk as fast as you want ,
What is wrong with Callie ? She still hasn &apos;t called me back .
Hey , Ross ?
and ask Torres if she can pick up the kids today ?
Don &apos;t you think I tried ? There &apos;s an emergency ,
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s gonna last 20 minutes .
There is nothing you can say after this morning
Dude , you and your rich boy problems .
I think she actually likes Stephanie .
Stand up for your girl .
So what are you gonna do ?
You know , it &apos;s like walking into a hornet &apos;s nest .
Sorry . Pardon me .
What are you doing here ?
The night of the gala ? At your house , remember ?
Yeah . Don &apos;t worry . I won &apos;t tell anyone what happened .
Uh , you could probably be more useful
Okay , sweet girl , just one more .
These are my regular eyes .
Your dad passed his stress test .
Good .
Sorry . I came to see if your drain output picked up
You &apos;re not progressing very quickly here .
You said that you would go if I set it up .
No , see , I never said that .
You tell someone you &apos;re gonna do something ,
your family . Make your children hate you .
But I don &apos;t want to let you down , too .
Now let me see . Did I miss anything else ?
That &apos;s what &apos;s called a rhetorical question , my dear .
Uh , Dr. Avery , can you elaborate
Yes , I saw evidence of that earlier this morning .
Well , it &apos;s possible he &apos;s gonna need a skin graft ,
wherever they live .
Suction , dear , come on .
Whoa , dial it back for a second .
No , she &apos;s fine . Are you ?
She is my patient ,
Probably should have checked back earlier .
I &apos;d like to start you on antibiotics .
Because there &apos;s a left shift ?
Murphy ..
And you didn &apos;t answer , so I went to check .
I helped you inside ...
We made the most amazing grilled cheese sandwiches
Do you really not remember any of it ?
Let &apos;s go back to the part where you said I was pretty .
Excuse me , Dr. Avery . Do you have a minute ?
Hey , yo ! What do you need ?
Here you go . You got it ?
Hey , Li , what &apos;s up ? Aloha , boys .
A crown for the queen .
That is disgusting . No , I don &apos;t want that .
You &apos;re just the man I &apos;m lookin &apos; for . Sir .
Lovely lid , Li .
Well , carry on . Yes , sir .
Staff Sergeant Dickson was a good man .
Is this allowed , sir ? : Ho . Jack Dickson
Your wife , she &apos;s expecting , yeah ?
Eight months , sir .
Yes , sir . I &apos;ve been there , I share your pain .
Corporal , this job of ours , driving trucks in heavily contested areas ,
Yes , sir .
I haven &apos;t really had time to think about it yet , sir .
You &apos;re the new squad leader .
Congratulations . You just got yourself another stripe .
Come again ?
He made the short list but you drew the long straw .
After it &apos;s over , my contract &apos;s up .
Is my beloved Corps not living up to your expectations ?
So you down for being my alpha team leader ?
Squad leader does the paperwork .
That &apos;s actually true .
Wow .
Everything changes , man .
I love givin &apos; you shit .
I can just bust your ass for it now .
Well , we said we didn &apos;t want an uptight asshole .
Very funny . No , you guys should really laugh it up .
You &apos;re a toolbox . That &apos;s what I can say .
You &apos;re all right .
So watch your corners , keep your head on a swivel .
Questions ?
Affirmative . It &apos;s a straight shot 75 clicks ,
No , sir ! That &apos;s good .
Would you agree with that , Corporal ?
All right , Marines , you stay safe , get the job done .
Thank you , sir .
All right , Marines , top up your ammo . Let &apos;s get ready to roll .
Thank you . You &apos;ll be riding with Corporal Kettner .
Go ahead . Go . You speak English ?
Corporal !
You really gonna let him have a gun ?

Hey , guys . What do you like better ,
Chocolate chip , only if it &apos;s baked hard .
Okay , pizza or sushi ? Sushi !

We &apos;ve been waiting here for over two hours .
Do you have an ETA on the EOD ? Over .
They &apos;ll get there as soon as they can . Hold tight .
Corporal .
Private Faisal , where the hell do you think you &apos;re going ?
That &apos;s why I don &apos;t like working with these motherfuckers .
Soto , watch him . Roger that .
Hey , Muji ! What the fuck you doing ?
Zou should wait there .
I have a visual on a pressure plate to my 12 o &apos;clock .
Blow you up ? What about me ?
Wait , what
Maybe it &apos;ll play the Beach Boys .
What are you doing , man ? Are you playing in the sand ?
You tell him to get away from that thing
Leave it alone . Let &apos;s go .
So if I trip it ,
Tell him not to touch a goddamned thing and get his ass back here .
I swear to God , man , you touch that thing ,
What the fuck did I say ?
If you ever pull any shit like that again , I &apos;ll kill you myself .
Yes , Corporal .
Yes , sir .
Shut the fuck up , Muji !
Roger , Thunder Ops , this is Gunmetal 2-5 .
What &apos;s your ETA to FOB Ouellette ? : Over .
Roger that , Gunmetal 2-5 . Thunder Ops out .
It means caveman
You couldn &apos;t handle what I &apos;m rocking downstairs , mama &apos;s boy .
What are you rocking downstairs ?
Landing strip ? Bald eagle ?
What &apos;s a Queen Christina ?
You look like a pretty hairy guy . You trim the hedge ?
You squeaky clean down there ?
Thunder Ops , this is Gunmetal 2-5 . Over .
Hey , Coop ? Let &apos;s go , move !

Shit !
Get up on the fucking .50 Cal !
We &apos;re taking heavy fire in the vicinity
Get on the goddamned .50 ! Gunmetal 2-5 .
Son of a bitch ! I can &apos;t do it .
A Norse god ? He &apos;s cool
I know a kid who would love that board
Yeah . I just had to ... I just left .
No , I just needed to leave .
And the cups .
in , like , 40 Arabic countries .
in Central Asia
Is there something I should be aware of as a customer ?
I &apos;m just going to get out .
Walter , you got to tip these guys .
Are you back from your work trip ?
This is all I got
For all your hard work .
You did great . You just let yourself out .
Are you gonna stay for dinner ?
I think I &apos;m just really wiped out after supervising moving that thing all day .
What is it : A class
Have you heard of that ? Sure .
Mom , why didn &apos;t you tell me ?
remember that .
Odessa , what is it you call it when he goes into one of his little places ?
Try to be real still , okay ?
Right in this ridge .
They call the snow leopard the &quot; ghost cat . &quot;
Sean , there was a negative that got separated from your roll .
It never came with the roll that you sent .
It &apos;s in your wallet .
The photograph .
So , I put it in a little slot , the little picture holder in there .
I told you , &quot; look inside &quot;
I don &apos;t have it anymore .
I mean , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;ve admired you for a very long time .
Sorry , I Just ..
Playful ?
But can I ask you , I mean , if you don &apos;t mind ..
No . Man , I liked it very much .
So you threw it away ?
The photograph ?
It was a beauty .
My mom .
1ilke , 17 hours .
Really great .
That &apos;s what you &apos;re having right there , man .
In the space of two hours . It was crazy .
I never checked
I think this works
This says it all
Not an employee .
There &apos;s the picture Sean wanted . 25 .
Yes , hi .
I &apos;m Dr. Adamson . And you come this way with me ?
All right .
He &apos;s up there for work .
Bet you wish you kept driving , huh ?
And take a deep breath .
Oh , thank god we were on the first floor .
Douche .
Hey , I need to , um ...
Apparently ,
Evan Lang , 16 , second- and third-degree burns over 60 % of his body .
So Robbins was rushing you ? you felt rushed ?
Sorry . I know it hurts .
I &apos;m fine . Come here .
And then I joined Dr. Sloan and Dr. Robbins .
Oh ! I &apos;m sorry . Sorry .
Uh , yeah , I &apos;ll be right there .
We &apos;re just gonna examine you ,
Where is my Dad ?
Listen ...
You don &apos;t really ...
You think I can &apos;t handle this ?
Because I
I ... yeah , I did. and who was with Mrs. Becker ?
No , I was never with Mrs. Becker .
I had just finished with him , actually .
Hey , are you free ? I need a hand .
Push another 25 of fentanyl .
So you said you &apos;re in town looking at a college ?
No ! no !
no , i-i can do it. i-i got it .
And did she have it ?
What the hell are you doing ?
He was , like , 5 if he was a day .
why was he there in first place .
The patient was coding and
They &apos;ll see you after , okay ? they &apos;re saying you &apos;re a hero .
Who is he talking about ?
Roy he is fine .
Her airway was completely closed off .
What &apos;s going on ?
Get me a smaller tube , a 6-0 .
Damn it . M
And he kept saying something about hitting her carotid .
What ?
I &apos;m asking
I give blood every two months .
Douche .
Don &apos;t stick me. i gotta go. sorry .
There was a problem .
Hey. uh , my guys would like to line the hall for Roy
He &apos;s , uh , 35 years on the job ,
no , i wasn &apos;t waving at Reed
Somebody page Hunt and get me those labs .
You &apos;re A.K. , right ?
Uh , no , no. this is Alex Karev .
Her carbon monoxide level was 28 ,
B.p. is 69 over 32. pulse is 158 .
Keep her on 100 % oxygen. no , no , do not .
Cristina , scrub out , go see if you can help. go .
We had to start a central line .
oh , my god .
These burns on your chest are pretty minor .
You never looked .
Let &apos;s go find mommy , huh ?
That &apos;s when we go looking for a second opinion .
They &apos;re all good doctors .
What do you think this was for ?
But this was for me .
At least I was able to do that .
Maybe it &apos;s not one doctor .
Who don &apos;t know each other
There was chaos .
Chaos .
And to fund his operations ,
What the hell is someone gonna do with a giant worm ?
What can &apos;t you do with it ?
I wouldn &apos;t bother .
Sounds like a duck hunt to me .
A decoy . A diversion .
Why would they want just this one when they &apos;ve got the keys
And we are the cause .
But like all living organisms ,
They are part of the earth &apos;s natural defense system .
But if governments are allowed to contain them , destroy them ,
Unless we restore balance .
A dead , charred world , overrun by monsters ?
Moscow , London , Washington , D.C .
On every continent , the Titans are triggering
Their behavior has become random .
No . Signal &apos;s too weak .
How many nukes do you have ?
We could help him .
is where King Ghidorah is nesting .
So this plan is what you would call a &quot; long shot , &quot; right ?
You ain &apos;t hear &apos; em , Griffin ?
We &apos;ll be out of range while you &apos;re down there ,
All citizens to report to the nearest evacuation center
Massive storms and other disasters
The grim search continues , as people around the world
Cities around the globe have fallen
The creatures just think it &apos;s another apex predator .
I mean , we are a bunch of horny murderous carnivores .
We track it , we find it , and we get my daughter back .
Godzilla will bring balance .
We got about 12 minutes before he goes thermonuclear .
I &apos;m saying in about 12 minutes ,
It &apos;s pretty rare that I don &apos;t manage to ..
I &apos;m guessing The Breeders aren &apos;t singing in praise of the Lord .
I &apos;m done here .
Yeah .
I think you &apos;re going to do really well here , Cammie .
Welcome .
I want you to put on your clothes and leave .
This movie &apos;s weird .
You knew that was going to happen .
I wouldn &apos;t know what to do .
I really didn &apos;t know it was going to happen .
I didn &apos;t have a choice .
I will not pray for God to change me
I must be the change .
Then when I learned that that was a sin , also ,
You can &apos;t get a pass from God to jerk off .
Steve , what are you experiencing ?
It &apos;s like watching Michael Angelo paint the Sistine Chapel .
That is why I &apos;m laughing .
Fuck you . No , it &apos;s not working on me at all .
Please ... Please don &apos;t stop . And so I cry sometimes
And I wake in the morning
&quot; Dear Cameron , I &apos;m very angry at you
When I think of how long it took me
You were making a lot of noise .
What were you dreaming about ?
Maybe the most amazing part of Adonis Creed &apos;s journey , Roy .
... ... is that tonight , he fights ...
Three years ago , that &apos;s a knockout .
You got him . Stay on him !
And a big left hook lands flush !
Come on , now ! Hands up ! Hands up !
Tell him , Donnie !
Come on , baby !
Can &apos;t say I &apos;m proud of what our sport &apos;s become ,
Sounds to me like you just trying to get paid .
&quot; The Rumble in the Jungle &quot; didn &apos;t just manifest itself .
Will it into existence .
You see anybody else standing here with a care in their heart ?
Yeah ? What &apos;s that ?
You know that ?
Four ?
The belt ain &apos;t enough .
Your dad , he knew that .
Not ready to give up yet .
Okay ! Come to me !
Ready ?
Drago trying to end it .
Get back ! Get back to your corner !
Obey my commands .
Extend the right , crack him with the left .
One early observation , Max .
Box .
Drago with a huge left hook .
Drago on the attack again , now driving Creed back into the ropes .
Ernie .
There &apos;s proof ! I left a note !
But you deserve children of your own .
I mean , we don &apos;t want those Sarcos sneaking up on us
I &apos;m not going anywhere .
I &apos;ll protect you from the Sarco Brothers .
They are beautiful .
Now , everyone , shoo ! My babies need their sleep ! Now shoo !
Now &apos;s our chance .
We can set the time machine
We won &apos;t get in any trouble !
It &apos;s about going back where we belong !
A h !
But the initialization sequence won &apos;t even run
Don &apos;t eat me ! I &apos;m mostly fat !
With all the earthquakes and the rising tar ,
And when we get rid of Tyra , the Upper Valley is ours for the taking
We &apos;ve got news all right , bosses .
Tyra &apos;s had babies ! Three of them !
No , she said they were her own !
Another egg , huh ?
And then we can take care of her , once and for all .
I can &apos;t wait to teach them everything I know .
I can &apos;t tell where they go .
They &apos;re coming from the river !
Hey , Mom ! Are you gonna let them leave the nest , huh ?
And it &apos;ll be good practice for them .
Why would you do this to me ?
Don &apos;t you know I would never let that happen ?
Don &apos;t you know that ?
Hi , and ... I loaded your pantry with Gushers .
He practices .
And a year later he goes back to the Reno .
So imagine if Jones just said .
To bird
There are no two words in English language
No. man , no .
But I tried
and I &apos;ll never apologize for how I tried .
Hey , Andrew .
You understand what I &apos;m saying ?
Done , Sir .
You &apos;re right ... for your cooking skills ...
How do you live like this , Tiger ?
Your salary has been lying untouched
How can I spend when I &apos;m never here ?
Wow .. how much have you saved ?
But your money will rot in the agency &apos;s bank ..
No ... I &apos;m not married yet .
I don &apos;t get to meet nice girls .
Nothing much ..
Someone who &apos;d make me want to live only for her .
Thank you
Maybe a little .
Yes .... . so that I get to know him better .
come to his house tomorrow morning .
No problem .
Thank you .
Whenever you are ready .
I &apos;m getting late for my play rehearsal . See you later .
Yes , of course ..
I wanted a boring name .
Look at her gorgeous hair ...
you &apos;ll have to get close to the professor now .
they don &apos;t even bolt their doors ...
Oh , no ...
Mr. Writer .... are you asking me out on a date ?
No ... I mean .. we can have a meal ...
Join us ... I &apos;ll let you pay the bill .
But I hope you won &apos;t turn up like this ?
Keep your foot behind that line .
Guys listen .. this is my friend Manish ... he &apos;s from India .
Have you ever thrown darts ?
You know what ? You don &apos;t look like a writer .
your hands .. they are not like a writer &apos;s ..
Why did you become a writer ?
Very few people follow their hearts , you &apos;re lucky .
that he should use his head and not his heart .
I admire a man who follows his heart .
So , Mr Nazar , what should I do according to your any tips ?
Hey , caveman
What the hell are you saying ?
Of course we can. but not on a mission .
And do we have a life beyond these missions or not ?
Is Zoya also ?
Tiger is a name meant for dogs .
Say thank you now ..
You &apos;ve chosen a nice girl ..
it &apos;s her play in the evening .
Excuse me ?
and that agent got away too ... what the hell are you doing , Tiger ?
And that guy would have come to know that I &apos;m not a writer .
Where will the Professor be right now ?
let &apos;s run away , Zoya .
God alone knows how long our two countries will keep fighting ...
And it might be a little difficult to run when we &apos;re old .
hurry up .... we have to go to the airport !
We &apos;re getting late for the airport .
Sir , we can &apos;t get through to Tiger &apos;s phone . He &apos;s out of reach ..
Kidnapped ! Nonsense !
Listen ... this news should not get out .
Which bank has he withdrawn the money from ?
Sir ... a total of 47 thousand dollars , Sir ...
Sir ... about 2.3 million Rupees .
the day I retire .. I &apos;ll blow it all up .
Do you have any idea ...
If anyone gets hold of that information ..
Sir ... I don &apos;t know exactly where Tiger is or what he &apos;s up to ...
I &apos;m certain about that .
we just heard that ...
What ?
Okay .
He &apos;ll help us book the tickets for tomorrow .
Might take a long .. maybe all night ... you take care .
There are 201 countries in the world ..
Captain Abrar ... why have you called me here ?
Because I &apos;m worried about you ...
I am fine .. but you will all have to be a little more patient .
What you &apos;re saying is right ...
He does not suspect me at all ..
I &apos;ll get him to you , but not here ...
I just wanted to see where this decision would take me .
Seen anyone like her ?
They look like bloody Indians .
Captain Abrar ...
and no one has shown up .
Sir. the information about Kazakhstan was wrong .
There were two other big flights that left Istanbul yesterday .
Then find out from there how many other flights departed ..
total number of passengers 825,802 ...
I don &apos;t care .
Sir ... my point is ...
We have created Tiger !
and will continue even after him .
What is it that they have and we don &apos;t ?
I don &apos;t care ... If you have to shoot him ... then do it
You deserve to be shot .
What have you done ?
201 countries .. there are 201 countries and you ..
Then where is she ?
For that I &apos;ll need you and your boys .
Yes but those people who she is with right now
Our friends .
you want us to attack the ISI in Cuba ...
Girl ?
when you found out she was a Pakistani .
whatever needs to be done , should be done now
What the hell is Tiger doing ?
Sir ... Bablu .... you &apos;ll be at this point ...
Sir ... don &apos;t forget we came here to catch that man
Tomorrow morning sharp at eight .
don &apos;t try anything strange at the airport .
Get out the back door now , move .
Yeah , we got one coming around the corner now .
Watch your six .
Should have brought more bullets .
But this tasted like ... there &apos;s no other way to say it really .
Hey guys , can you please keep it down ?
Sorry . I &apos;m having dinner with Gallagher over here .
You could . You &apos;re funny . Your timing is perfect .
It &apos;s just .. I &apos;m having a bit of a allergic reaction .
So stay away from me .
Anyway , you are right .
The chatter picked up later that night .
I can pull up her file .
So warm in here .
Jesus , not on my keyboard , with your pink eye infected fingers .
It really is just a allergic reaction .
Wow . Okay , we could order you your own glass .
My life is a disaster .
I &apos;m 40 , I live by myself .
I mean , when I gave up teaching to join the CIA .
I thought I was going to be this amazing spy .
Have an Old Fashioned , please .
Super slow .
Here you go , Miss Walker . Thank you .
Heat sensors aren &apos;t picking anything up .
I don &apos;t like this , Tine .
Let &apos;s go in .
Can you switch out for a new one ?
Her father would never have let himself this exposed .
I like things that are easy .
I don &apos;t know how you do things like that .
I don &apos;t know
Fine , what &apos;s happening ?
Ee &apos;s about to die
And I would hopefully takes us to Rayna .
I go into the face-off machine .
I turned up . They &apos;ll never know it &apos;s me .
What , I &apos;ve got to pay ?
Yes , it does !
Seriously . You got to cut that out .
one of us has to go in .
We &apos;ve all gone deep before , and we always gotten our guy .
Now we get Rayna , De Luca and some top terrorist leadership
For Tine
You &apos;re not seriously considering this , are you ?
Ford , if you call me Betty Crocker ,
I also took a Vow to avenge my fallen comrades . We all fucking did .
I &apos;m pretty sure we all took a fucking Vow .
I remember raising my fucking hand and saying some shit .
You might as well accept my resignation now .
This anti-fungi spray can freeze and disable any security system .
It &apos;s also a pepper spray .
It &apos;s a
I don &apos;t have that problem .
Chew one of these .
Finally .
Okay . I &apos;ve read about this , I &apos;ve even looked it
rom Beaches .
Hey Pat , I &apos;m flying .
Don &apos;t wear out the battery on that .
No . You are not going to get that , alright .
Hurry up and get dressed .
The Jouvre .
Oh . I hope it &apos;s that . Is it that one ?
Oh man .
Nancy ? Please tell me you can hear me .
Okay .
We have now vermin free
Which means that De Luke &apos;s is right across the street at 39 .
De Luca must have known we were coming
Stay focus . We can do this .
Nothing &apos;s coming up .
He is meeting with some woman . I don &apos;t recognize her .
No , it &apos;s hard to make out
It &apos;s a setup .
I left my baby in the shop !
Susan , tell them you shat your pants .
I shat my pants !
Move !
Nancy , I &apos;m in pursuit on one of the terrorists .
You &apos;re in pursuit ?
Oh God . He went into a building .
Time to call it a day now .
What ?
He &apos;s at the top of the stairs .
Cooper , put down the goddamn camera .
And , look on the desk there &apos;s some photos there
Hack into the Rolls tracking system .
Tap into Boyanov &apos;s feed .
I &apos;m gonna head to the airport .
Ma &apos;am , I really think I can do this .
And say that , I just saved a lot of people .
Pull back that rug in the corner .
Oh , thank God !

I &apos;m rooting for that guy . I want him to win .
According to our data De Luca spends all night at the casino .
Susan , you heard Elaine .
I &apos;ll track De Luca inside , and then I &apos;ll report .
Susan , your cat lady look is not going to fit in , in there .
This is full-blown rogue .
I really hope De Luca is still in there , for your sake .
You should &apos;ve gone to cheaper stores , Susan .
She doesn &apos;t seem so bad .
Screw you and your candy .
All right .
I , um
Everybody &apos;s making these huge life decisions ,
I &apos;m supposed to be such a big part of their lives ,
Do you even have the authority to ban someone from NICU ?
Oh , oh , oh
I just came by to tell you that you were wrong .
You &apos;re kidding .
But I really just want to cure her disease .
built of old
I &apos;m sorry . I &apos;m not really comfortable talking about this .
It was a lovely evening .
And it was worth it .
Boom !
It was. terrible .
But this is way worse .
She &apos;s maxed out on meds .
that she legally committed fraud , and she did .
Don &apos;t stop . Don &apos;t hesitate .
Well , all right , but I don &apos;t see this as a promising endeavor .
We are going to throw leonard a kick-ass
Leonard made it very clear he doesn &apos;t want a party .
He just doesn &apos;t know he wants one &apos; cause he &apos;s never had one .
Howard ,
Sheldon , do you understand the concept of blackmail ?
Yeah , I have an idea .
That &apos;s not the secret knock .
what difference does it make ?
Is that rai and howard ?
Will you just let us in .
Well , rai got him an awesome ,
Nice .
Okay , well , he might like that .
Sheldon , I didn &apos;t see your present .
Why not ? don &apos;t ask .
I accept your premise ; I reject your conclusion .
What ?
I &apos;ll call you when it &apos;s in the dryer .
Um , that one .
Sure.He doesn &apos;t need them .
Oh , okay , then this one .
The man on the box looks so happy .
penny , listen , I &apos;ve got a problem .
Look , you gotta stall leonard a little longer .
You have to. we all have to be there at the same time to yell surprise .
We &apos;re in a hospital right now .
Leonard &apos;s fine . I &apos;m fine .
Okay , I don &apos;t need your attitude .
Look , I &apos;ve done my best ,
You keep him there a little longer , and when you get to the party ,
I got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem ,
well , maybe there &apos;ll be more planes double-checking or ships ?
We are at war , Aldrich .
We get one quick look at best .
Got two magazines .
Keep that in your pocket . The last thing we need is a hole in this raft .
Here &apos;s a whistle .
Yes , Chief .
If that &apos;s correct , then she &apos;s east . I had her west .
See , that &apos;s why you got to do it last
Be better if we could eat it .
No , it was another one .
marks in school as long I learned the stuff .
I saw that report card , and saw that big shiny &quot; F. &quot;
I just walked out of school and never went back .
You bet I did .
A guy can have a handful and still be okay ?
Coming up on 120 hours .
Yeah , affirmative .
Here we are , by dead reckoning .
With luck , right here .
Closest friendly land in the Pacific .
What if it just keeps shifting , Chief ?
Unless .
You want a damn watch so bad ?
I do my share . More .
Who do you think is navigating this ship ? Are you ?
Yeah , one for each man .
I &apos;m trying . But everything &apos;s so far away .
My wife ..
She burned a hole in it with her cigarette .
I can picture the dress and the dove .
Tony .
You &apos;ll make a great couple .
... clouds are going to start to build ,
2 : 00 to 4 : 00 p.m. , you can see a few ...
What I do know is this :
And she was always there for her family .
All of us .
Therefore , let us all pray for her soul .
Without a co-star .
Jigga jigga damn !
Think your mom will let you ?
I &apos;ve sat next to people before at dinner .
Wine that &apos;s not from a box ?
Did you get to meet the host , I want to say
Oh , hey there , hot shot .
I need that to be a different Bob .
It was Adam , Eve , and Bob .
Bob , meet Caroline Channing .
Not a lot on top .
If me and Randy are May-December ,
Yeah , that I want to die before 60 .
I &apos;m gonna pass .
I &apos;m just glad to be out of the house .
Practice being excited to meet Drew Carey .
My Bob never knows when I &apos;m faking it .
Max ! I &apos;ve been looking all over for you .
This isn &apos;t a scene in the movie .
Max , there would be no movie without you .
He lost $ 50,000 ,
And you and I are not gonna be
I was going to name my first-born &quot; Apple , &quot;
But I &apos;m in the mix .
But I want you there .
All right , screw it .
Why stop making bad decisions now ?
I don &apos;t know ,
Will you do me the honor ..
After that embarrassing night in the restaurant ,
It &apos;s just so soon to be talking about marriage .
Wait !
I mean , it happened 20 years ago ,
even good guys make mistakes if the circumstances are right .
Susan , I am in the middle of nowhere .
So should I tell Lynette ?
Maybe just keep an eye on the situation .
Just so you know , when you come home ,
having a sad day .
Why would you say that ?
The taxi picked her up this morning .
Because I have a little proposition for you .
Oh , yes .
We should have just gone under
Mitzi sold . She &apos;s not gonna be around
What the hell ?
I live here . Oh , I guess you would have noticed ,
Puts me up in a nice hotel , and then he never showed .
So , wait . You didn &apos;t sell your house to Paul Young ?
Please . I &apos;m not gonna screw over my neighbors .
What is happening to this neighborhood ?
That is a school bus , Renee . Those are children .
Well ..
So the whole right side of the closet is yours ,
I wish we had been nicer to Paul .
I think about what he must have gone through in prison ,
It &apos;s not right .
We will stop this son of a bitch .
Hey . M.J. &apos; s spending the night at a friend &apos;s house ,
He also mentioned all that work that needs to be done
But if you wanna thank me ,
The media will be arriving shortly ,
While you &apos;re waiting , would you like a tour of the facility ?
Okay . Maybe I misread some signals .
Okay . If that &apos;s the way you feel ,
Well , here &apos;s trouble .
Looks like we &apos;re outnumbered now .
The cavalry .
I &apos;m not too late , am I ?
You &apos;re just in time .
Okay ! Here &apos;s the plan .
That &apos;s when we all begin chanting , okay ? You got it ?
We need to talk now .
Woman versus shattered baseball bat .
B.P.85 palp , pressure 135 .
My jersey &apos;s really messed up .
Okay , everybody . Ready ? On my count .
I &apos;m here . I &apos;m right here , okay ?
Uh , sorry .
Yeah , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a good idea .
Yeah , we agreed to a lot of things . So ...
Murphy , make yourself useful and put a splint on that arm .
Hey , Cara .
She teaches kindergarten .
And she can &apos;t teach without feeling her best , right ?
Thank you ... so much .
She has lost a lot of blood , but she &apos;s stable for now .
Okay . Okay , thanks .
Because I &apos;m busy rescheduling surgeries .
Owen ?
Good . I have two of you here . At least maybe we could ...
We &apos;re not buying the babies jewelry .
Right now , we &apos;re low on NICU blankets .
Don &apos;t tell me . Tell the board !
Well , I took your advice about transfers ...
That is my patient .
There was no way to do the repair without visibility .
And because you &apos;re careless and thoughtless ,
She was dying !
Come on .
But that &apos;s what he needs .
It &apos;s just a mess over there .
Okay , Ross , I can &apos;t read this . Take this .
I know .
You &apos;re an intern .
You &apos;re pretending like it isn &apos;t happening ,
She came all this way with a baby ,
I &apos;m offering to take care of this right now .
Avery . I have one more patient for you .
And I &apos;m calling Cara McAdams first thing
She &apos;s all set for you first thing tomorrow .
I lied .
Yeah , I
So , yeah , I lied , and now you have the money .
Avery . I needed to make a point with you .
So you need to do something now .
Yeah . You all need to meet .
You &apos;re our boss , and you can lie .
You gotta get over this &quot; Special &quot; thing .
Every girl &apos;s dream .
God , you have the right person right there .
This family is not scared . This boy is not scared .
I &apos;m doing this because they asked me to and because I can .
The arrhythmias are coming closer .
Thank you .
Oh , have you seen my wife and baby ?
Meredith .
I woke up to nothing and nobody .
I have to go check on Richard .
You look like hell .
I just need to go lie down .
Oh , you make me laugh , sad clown .
Leonard will be back in a couple days
Okay , well , I don &apos;t know how much you want to spend ,
Oh , this isn &apos;t a gag gift , Stuart .
ilt &apos;s a pretty rare piece .
I &apos;m a real collector .
Oh , I shouldn &apos;t even have mentioned it .
Why are you on a diet ?
Had to buy these pants in the men &apos;s section .
I made some brownies . You want one ?
I mean , you know
We are . Stop it .
Really ? Tell that to the bathroom scale .
Fine , forget I asked .
Awful .
Why can &apos;t she do it ?
Do you know a Corporal Coughlin ?
Sorry , but I &apos;ve only been here for a couple months .
I swear to God , they blow up another well ,
Hey , do I have to buy a dress for your wedding ?
Yeah ?
The only thing I ask is that you make sure my friend is there .
I get it .
Jesus , Stern !
Oh , great , we &apos;re all going to Kandahar !
Kim , if we are going to Kandahar ,
Ah ! It &apos;s so pretty , I don &apos;t even want to vote .
Is this your car , Fahim ?
This is a fucking piece of shit .
No one is staring at me . It &apos;s weird .
Shit .
is always in purple ,
Sir , do you have a minute ?
Okay . Well , I &apos;m covering the girls &apos; school
This war is like fucking a gorilla .
So they say .
When I worked in the hospital ,
And we would wonder how the arm got broken to begin with .
Hmm .
In fact , when the fight-or-flight instinct
Okay , great . Are we having the Afghan version of this conversation ,
I owe you one .
And then we can make it an even three .
Or a half of one and we can make it an even three .
My middle name is Eoghan .
Goddamn ! Once you got no legs ,
So , you &apos;re not gonna yell at me ?
Hey , I &apos;m making blackberry cobbler .
Yum !
So , um ... see you soon .
Alright , see you tonight .
See you tonight .
I can reach for my own water .
There &apos;s nothing wrong with me helping you with that .
Except for the ball gag and jock strap , we &apos;re good .
What do you need , Mom ?
See if Maggie &apos;s left us any .
Boy , do you look like a steaming pile of crap , kid .
Thought you were his favorite .
I &apos;m assuming you &apos;re Levi , the doctor .
How is he ?
Which , I &apos;ve learned , does not include
I &apos;ll come back to check on you later .
You know , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s an accident ,
I think there &apos;s a part of him that wanted you to come here
How does it feel when it &apos;s quiet and cold ?
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures .
He and Maggie are arguing .
They &apos;ve been trying to be civil for our sake ,
Well , that would be hard
Uh , I don &apos;t think any of us should have been here tonight .
Uh , Vic , wait . I , um ...
I-I won &apos;t do it again .
Deal . Okay .
Bye . Bye .
The good news is , when the truth is out ..
I didn &apos;t hear you come in .
Uncle Saul is gone .
No , but I am Super Gay .
The only person who could is the woman
then I will do it .
yellow .
Besides , when you &apos;re in the room ,
Excuse me .
And good morning to you .
I &apos;m thinking we should hang .
Look , one woman at a bar is just sad .
So what do you say ?
That &apos;s a lovely offer , but I think I &apos;m gonna pass .
We gotta get back in the game ,
Really . Renee , that is just not how I like to meet men .
Let the stud hunt begin .
You okay ?
Yeah .
Most of my friends were either stuffed or plastic .
Tom the college nerd .
Hey , I was plenty cool in college .
So ... what do you say ?
I couldn &apos;t feel happier than I do right now .
Yeah .
No . I think it says &quot; Credit card declined . &quot;
I &apos;ve been selling a lot of my jewelry .
Out there and keep selling .
I can &apos;t spend the rest of my life
I have to find her .
But Sanchez is a pretty common name .
But I know something the hospital doesn &apos;t .
She lived in El Paso , and she was so excited to have
So you think you can find her ?
Carlos is on board with this , right ?
Okay . Inside .
It &apos;s about your Christmas gift .
Look closely . The buttons are shiny .
I have never seen so many sweater sets .
There is nothing wrong with my clothing .
Oh , I don &apos;t think so . He just left .
Now you think I should play
Okay , before you do anything hasty ,
Renee , wait . Please don &apos;t go home with Keith .
Oh , he &apos;s the one you like , isn &apos;t he ?
Aw , gee , then chip won &apos;t ask me to the prom .
Oh , it &apos;s getting late .
Keith , hi . It &apos;s Bree .
Nope . Nobody tells me anything .
Okay , fine . They think he &apos;s a murderer .
Felicia Tillman framed him .
What do you mean ?
her sister Martha was murdered . And , all due respect ,
Felicia may be a few fingers short of a high five ,
I guess all that &apos;s left is a little vacuuming .
Maxine says I can &apos;t go back online
Fine . I am sorry , okay ?
What was going through your mind ?
See , my family &apos;s in Virginia ,
And even with that extra money .
I know . Probably shouldn &apos;t have bought all that .
Every once in a while , you want a little splurge .
But ... definitely by the end of the year ,
How long have you been doing this ?
Hey , um ... would you mind if we just stayed home
No tie ?
Dang it , Susan ! Why ?
Oh . I think we should save that money
I had a lovely time at the poker game the other day .
Well ..
What &apos;s her name ? Martha something .
I guess Felicia Tillman spread her poison pretty wide .
I did not have you pegged as a stoner .
There &apos;s a lot that you don &apos;t know about me .
Where are you going ?
Then I gotta turn that bong I made back into a lamp .
We found them .
Yeah .
Yep .
Hopefully we &apos;re not too late .
Hey ...
Got some good news , sir .
Just hand it over to local authorities for now .
Got it .
I hit him with a shovel , man !
So l just , I tied him up and in put him in the back room
But charles westmoreland did ,
Now , D.B. Stopped at the station in american fork ,
The money .
From American Fork , he couldn &apos;t have gone further
Those cons are in one of these towns ,
We &apos;re gonna have to dig up the floor to get to it .
Well , the company will cover all costs .
It &apos;ll look as good as new .
One way or another we &apos;ll be out of here today .
We wouldn &apos;t
Touche .
I &apos;m not going nowhere .
Wait a minute.Hold on , man .
You know , I say I want in ,
Then you decide to play nice
Thank you .
And kickin &apos; , home boy .
Man , if I can do rapid deployment

Did you talk to Maricruz ?
I got to get some water or something .

What &apos;s it called ?
Whoa , whoa . What are you doing ? !
They &apos;re here .
Who &apos;s there ?
You okay ?
Can you tell me what happened ?
I made him a peanut butter sandwich .
And once the kids went to sleep ,
And afterwards , I &apos;d just sit there
Rub her lotion on , comb her hair .
This is my partner , Jay Pritchett .
Not in the least .
We want this lot ,
It &apos;s not about the huge profits .
Oh , I know all about dreams .
Good luck to you , gentlemen .
Would you get ahold of yourself .
He &apos;ll be back .
Whether you meant it or not , this is my dream .
And we will .
I &apos;m gonna pogo it .
Oh , thank god you &apos;re here . It &apos;s a nightmare .
Telling them there &apos;s no more overtime was bad ,
Sales-wise we didn &apos;t exactly have
You &apos;re a drama queen !
The game is on , solve it !
No chance for you to be a hero this time , Mr Holmes .
To the very best of times , John .
How is this possible ?
I &apos;ve only been gone four minutes .
Who needs me this time ?
Is it intentional ?
Said you were out , insisted on waiting .
Didn &apos;t you ask her what she wanted ?
Why didn &apos;t you ask her ?
Good afternoon . I am Sherlock Holmes ,
Holmes !
You have come to this agency as a last resort ,
All of this is , of course , perfectly evident from your perfume .
Yes , her perfume , which brings insight to me and disaster to you .
Begin what ?
Oh , you have a case , then , a new one ?
I shall have to go deep .
Myself .
Am I not beautiful , Thomas ?
Who ..
What does it look like , my handsome friend ?
Dr Hooper , I asked Mr Holmes to come here . Cooperate .
There are two &quot; Features of interest , &quot;
You do , actually , quite a lot .
She has been categorically identified .
Then who was that in Limehouse last night ?
It can &apos;t have been . She was dead , she was here .
He had no reason to lie , could hardly have been mistaken .
A what ? !
Hmm ? You know ?
This whole thing could have been planned .
How breathtakingly prescient of her .
Then what &apos;s your theory ?
I , I don &apos;t understand ...
Really ?
Amazinq .... what one has to do to get ahead in a man &apos;s world .
Get back to work !
Not yet .
And I shall have to go deeper still .
And then under very unexpected circumstances .
Hush , please , this is a matter of supreme importance .
I can tell .
I know when you &apos;re hiding stuff .
You &apos;re growing up so fast .
But every day you &apos;re getting stronger and smarter .
People would always look at us .
They probably thought we were a christian singing group .
I wouldn &apos;t trade that memory for anything .
Love bites , doesn &apos;t it ?
He was really sweet .
But trust me , i &apos;m never seeing him again .
It cost you one guy to face the truth .
Now you can move on just like tom .
Mm-Hmm .
What ?
Yeah . Why ? Is that bad ?
Doesn &apos;t she know bree &apos;s an alcoholic ?
Well .. at least this helps explain The way bree &apos;s been acting lately .
How could we not know this ?
We &apos;re your friends . We wanna help .
Aof JOU .
Talk to US , sweetie . Why are you behaving like this ?
It &apos;s not like we can &apos;t see what &apos;s going on .
Wow , can &apos;t hide anything from you girls , huh ?
What ?
How &apos;d that little nugget of information
It &apos;s not a joke .
Or the &quot; in crowd &quot; at the Virgin Terminal ?
You can make all the death threats you want ,
Hey , everybody !
Judy , big gal , little beard ?
It &apos;s pretty quiet over there these days .
Seriously . I haven &apos;t been this excited
I &apos;m just happy I get to be out front here .

But dat key though ?
Wait , should someone make a speech ?
Yes ! Rise , gate , rise !
Yes , I &apos;m drunk with power .
All right . Here they come .

Hey , would you feel better if you held my giant keys ?
Welcome , you &apos;re our first customer .
Is it you ?
Welcome , everyone .
What do a Rubik &apos;s Cube and a penis have in common ?
A Rubik &apos;s Cube was a popular &apos; 80s toy .

Something about a seal being tight ..
He says , &quot; What &apos;s up , you ? &quot;
It &apos;s really been a long time for you , hasn &apos;t it ?
Tough crowd .
Oh come on , Han . Loosen up .

Oleg is a bad cook .
But somehow , when they get together , magic .

Hey , I brought you some coffee .
Oh , no .
Uh , I wish I didn &apos;t have to saddle you with this , Karev , but
Unpaid balance ? I-I don &apos;t get it .
Yeah , and insurance doesn &apos;t take care of everything .
But accounting &apos;s been pressuring me since the merger ,
Mm , delivered her yesterday .
Laura ? Laura , can you hear me ?
She &apos;s struggling , but she &apos;s hanging on .
I &apos;m sorry. no. you &apos;re too unstable to move .
I just want to hold her . Mm-hmm .
She can &apos;t go before she &apos;s ever even been held .
Push 10 of diazepam
Doubt it. at this rate ,
So what , you &apos;re just gonna stand there and watch her die ?
That sucks .

Let &apos;s take a look .
End-tidal c-0-2 just dropped from 34 to 22 .
She has a new murmur .
She was not crashing .
I handled it , and she &apos;s fine .

Hunt &apos;s just jealous he didn &apos;t do it himself .
Okay , you won &apos;t believe what just happened in the surgery
What :
I mean really tell me ,
Damn it . I need more light .

And then he stopped taking my calls ,
You know , I knew that sweater wasn &apos;t stolen .

He &apos;s heard worse .

I like to sit and people watch .
This is nice .
Oh shit , you heard that ?

Excellent candidate . Excellent organs . Young .
You were robbed . You got screwed by politics .

Wake up , holly

You know who your father is

Oh , no . That &apos;s my landlady . She &apos;s cool .
Well , she &apos;s not that cool .
Well , what do you mean ?
You left it in the printer .
Yeah , for a house in baltimore .
He &apos;s only back because he wants something .
I just know we &apos;re not safe here .
It couldn &apos;t be that he wants to be in my life , that he loves me .
I found that out the hard way ,
I &apos;m staying here with my father .
It &apos;s not really a good time .
Well , that sounds boring . I know .
Bree , you don &apos;t understand .
I &apos;d hate for him to be around en you had another attack of delayed morality ,
He is my son , too .
oh , shut up already .
I could swing by and pick you up , if you want .
Dylan , your father and i need to talk .. in private .
Yes , you are .
I do .
At &apos;s why I &apos;ve forgiven you for kidnapping our daughter .
Wayne
I still think we could be happy together .
Okay , look , maybe I was wrong . Maybe it was flour . Maybe she &apos;s a pastry chef .
All right , look , I know we have to do something , but this woman &apos;s our friend .
Um , Doug &apos;s gay .
He got me in with Open Space though ,
Oh , thank you , yeah , I &apos;m done .
Daddy said you were really good .
It wasn &apos;t my best nicht but at least he could get ,
What do you mean ?
It &apos;s gonna be delicious .
It will be . Can &apos;t wait .
It &apos;s a very big decision , we &apos;re excited .
And they just had their first child .
Well , Yeah .
Want one ?
Yes we do .
Merry Christmas ! Merry Christmas ! Merry Christmas !
Thank God .
But what worries me are the memory tests that I sent you for .
And there is evidence of decline in your level of mental function .
What , in particular , would you be looking for ?
It would be rare for someone as young as yourself
I really didn &apos;t think that would be necessary .
Are we both here on the 17th ?
Un-huh , Phil and Diane were saying , they might come to town for the weekend .
Till it &apos;s clean .
What time is it ?
I &apos;ve um , I &apos;ve got something wrong with me .
I &apos;ve been seeing a neurologist .
I &apos;m afraid so .
I &apos;m afraid is 100 % o .
I don &apos;t think we should tell them .
But we will by then , if I go in next week .
What the hell is the Goddamn elevator ?
John it &apos;s okay
Well , um , everybody .
Oh boy .
No , no , it &apos;s nothing like that .
Baby how are you feeling ?
One good thing , at least I found out before the next IUI session
Anna where are you ? I &apos;m on my way to a lecture
Alice , where the hell were you ?
You &apos;ve been gone for two hours , I was worried about you .
Well I hope you enjoyed that
I &apos;m sorry I forgot . I have Alzheimer &apos;s .
I told you , I can &apos;t when I &apos;m running
I hate that this is happening to me .
I am ,
I think you &apos;re doing great recently .
I wish I had cancer .
No , I do . I mean it . I mean ,
In 2013 , we completed exterior repairs ,
We also took away a lot of the old security doors .
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve experienced this yet with your parents
So we redefined activities to include
Starting with knowing about the person
That &apos;s heartbreaking
Families and friends are welcome any hour , day or night .
Well , Sunday is the day they usually come by .
That &apos;s a chair alarm ,
It &apos;s just a precautionary measure .
We do have mainly female residents here , but there are men .
Do you want to try Lunesta ?
That &apos;s very strong
Oh I love it here .
Can you believe that that was 30 years ?
Oh that was a complicated time , huh ?
Yeah , something like that .
Me too . We had a great time though .
Don &apos;t you wish we had more of them ?
But , yeah , you know , all of it .
So I am , that &apos;s how I like it .
I like you the way you are ,
This is so great you know ,
I don &apos;t know . You can spend more time here . Go to Butan .
Okay , well you know what ?
Monday .
Are we going running ?
What I liked about it was how ... how big ,
It &apos;s unbelievable to me that you guys had lived through that .
Yeah , everybody did .
But you think ,
Yeah . How did you know that ?
There will come a time we all know ,
Now we must live ,
It &apos;s autumn now , soon it will be winter ,
Yes , so good .
Clearly Alice &apos;s memory is falling , but she &apos;s still incredibly resourceful .
II know you are discouraged .
Alice .
Yes , I &apos;m looking forward to it .
Are you sure this is a good idea ? Considering the state she &apos;s in ,
But what ?
I don &apos;t understand what you mean by &quot; personal . &quot;
You weren &apos;t listening because that &apos;s all there . That &apos;s in the speech .
Dunno , then I won &apos;t ask , then .
I can &apos;t because I have done it already .
Got it , totally , just practice more .
You can turn to it one more .
Sorry .
All my life , I have accumulated memories ,
As you can imagine , or as you know ,
I know I &apos;m alive .
I rail against myself for not being able to remember things ,
Struggling to be part of things , to stay connected to who I once was .
It &apos;s really all I can do ,
It will go , I know it will . It may be gone by tomorrow ,
It &apos;s the Mayo Clinic , start up next spring ,
Everything I know is here ,
It &apos;s just a two-hour flight , we &apos;d see them as often as we do now .
Hey mama . It &apos;s Anna , mom .
It &apos;s ok
How are you feeling ?
Mr. Student Council President ,
Why would you call me that ?
Not to be hyperbolic , but humans are a decade away
You are dressed like a character
So , I had a problem .
Oh , and telling my dad .
By the time they pulled the pigs off him ,
Animals don &apos;t attack people for no reason .
Run , Jerry ! They do terrible things !
The box of hair products we pre-shipped has arrived
Hey ! That &apos;s crazy talk .
My mom will be cool , but my dad is gonna freak out .
Your dad and I are buds .
And that means the Coast Guard
Smell those side dishes .
You know what &apos;s not a picnic ?
Thanks , Dad . I &apos;ll take my chances .
Oh , my God , he &apos;s gonna kill everyone in the house .
Listen to me .
You can never , ever tell him .
I mean , he pulls it out for everything .
You &apos;re cold ? I &apos;ll go get you a blanket !
Pig in a blanket ?
All right , it &apos;s time to fry this turkey .
You heard him .
You &apos;re not the president of goggle lowering .
What could Cam have done ?
I saw a list of clues in a magazine .
I think it &apos;s sweet that you think
Oh , I saw some champagne back there .
Oh ! Take the defibrillator , I &apos;ll call 911 .
I watch a lot of &quot; Grey &apos;s Anatomy , &quot;
Jerry , no , Jerry .
Look at his basket . Wasn &apos;t much of a life .
I &apos;m feeling better , Pritchett . I think it was just gas .
Oh , I deserve some of the blame .
The hell happened here ?
It &apos;s possible I &apos;ve been electrocuted one too many times .
I saw a man nearly die right in front of me .
It &apos;s a lot to think about .
Phil , get me a beer .
I learned something today. too .
Fruit Roll-ups , chips , chocolate milk ? Ugh .
I &apos;m packing you a lunch .
I thought it would be when I was in my 40s .
What are you even still doing home ?
Yeah . I &apos;m just going in a little late .
And I saw you sneak those carrots out of your lunch .
Kind of an intimidating character .
You knew it was me .
What are you tearing through ?
In English , your second language .
Hey , I &apos;ll bet you can help
Give me a thrill . Take a whack at it .
I &apos;m sure you can figure out this clue .
What the hell ? !
Damn it .
It-exists ?
Why is your piano covered with a sheet ?
They say even five minutes of direct sunlight on a new piano
Yeah .
But then I see you with this , huh ?
Look , I &apos;m-I &apos;m hungry , okay ?
Hey , hey , hey , hey , come on .
Okay , I can see you up there .
Cause &apos; cause you and I are friends now .
Friends .
Sucre ?
Wow , look at that halo
I don &apos;t have a choice , Alex What &apos;d you tell me
Max &apos;s mom plays Nancy ,
Tell your cult , maybe I &apos;ll see them next year .
Papers , your homework , all of it .
FPlease , Max , what do you say ? You wanna graduate , or not ?
He likes you so much , it &apos;s so cute .
He &apos;s like a giant , okay ? So , imagine us together .
Hey ! Hi .
I figured you needed some , uh , moral support .
No , don &apos;t be crazy , Christopher .
I &apos;m going to go popcorn up , see you inside .
I &apos;m sorry . That &apos;s a weird thing to say , isn &apos;t it ?
Oh , yeah , he just got like super-sick super-fast .
Oh , no , not the super-sick super-fast .
Yeah , I &apos;m here for an appearance .
Come on , Max . Of course , I would remember .
Hey , do you want anything ?
That way , every handful is , like , kind of suspenseful ?
Hey , Chris , I &apos;m just gonna have a Diet Coke
You know what , I &apos;m just going to come with you .
She &apos;s like a living nightmare .
Look , she &apos;s probably gonna pee on him
Uh-huh . How do we get outta here ? Yeah , I like that question .
Duncan , can you answer that question , please ?
Tt &apos;s 1960 !
They &apos;re probably Just landfills waiting to be
I know for a fact my parents haven &apos;t met
Talking about her boobs ! You guys get me , right ?
Is that okay ? Yeah ?
How about my friends don &apos;t kick your ass ?
Yeah , right . You want to go ?
And that would kill you . That &apos;s a karate technique .
Seven times .
Fine . How about you go suck a turd ?
Okay , let &apos;s just go get the .
Oh , hey , you wanna give me a hand ?
All right . Let &apos;s rock and roll .
What ? Nothing .
I know what &apos;s going to go down at this camp ,
Uh ..
Yeah , he &apos;s , uh ..
Okay , let &apos;s go . You want to go ?
Mom , no !
What are you doing here ? Get out !
Kurt said he liked me , okay . He said it .
You are special .
Special to who ?
Who are you , Max ?
Oh , shit .
You babes just couldn &apos;t wait , could you ?
Genie &apos;s already out of the bottle . Make a wish .
I don &apos;t know . Do you hear that ?
Lock the windows ! Shut the curtains ! He can see us !
Oh ! I love legends .
It all happened so long ago .
And he was always picked on for being
And we &apos;d have a baby . A girl .
Anything .
The best
I should have known something was up with this place .
Just a matter of time before
Tried . Won &apos;t sell .
Maybe she could be persuaded .
That &apos;s the word on the street .
Yeah , well , I &apos;ll tell ya ...
But then again , he &apos;s such a sick little fuck .
I got to shut this fucking thing down , John .
That is a big fucking problem .
Yeah , maybe .
That is why I &apos;m gonna file it very deep .
That &apos;s against protocol .
Fuck it . It &apos;s a little lie ,
Authorities in Tulsa , Oklahoma , are still sifting through clues
Turn it up .
Hey ! Turn it the fuck up !
Sandy Gilmore has a report .
This meeting between Rizzo and Sal Manzinni .
Gentlemen , this is Brian Halloran .
There &apos;s a lot I can tell you . I need guarantees first .
Okay .
It &apos;s been on the news and everything .
So , what does some random Jai alai guy in Tulsa
You two know anything about this ?
Bulger paid me 20 grand to keep quiet about the hit .
How should I know ? I didn &apos;t do the hit .
How do you know it was Martorano ?
All right ? I know these things .
Well , so far , you haven &apos;t given us anything to merit protection .
Where was this so-called meeting taking place ?
All right , all right .
I &apos;m in Miami , I hear Jimmy &apos;s in town ,
And then Jimmy says ..
We all know what that means , right ?
You can &apos;t tell me they &apos;re not connected to this killing !
It &apos;s too important ! You can &apos;t do it !
It &apos;s fucking over .
I think we finally fucking got him .
Mr. Angiulo , we &apos;re not infiltrating legitimate businesses .
We &apos;re selling marijuana . We &apos;re not infiltrating .
Thanks for all the support .
Congratulations . And a hell of a career .
Tell you the truth , I don &apos;t really care .
I &apos;m starting my own defense practice .
I don &apos;t blame you . Best of luck with that .
Yeah .
Fred Wyshak . Fucking bulldog who was kicking ass down in Jersey ,
I will .
Thanks for coming , John . Take care .
This is so fucking sick .
What the fuck was in your mind
You keep your voice down .
This is my kitchen .
Don &apos;t even fucking start with that , okay ?
These fucking assholes from Cambridge ,
No ! No way .
Something &apos;s off . I know this guy . This doesn &apos;t happen .
6-1 , be advised , your window is closed .
No , sir , Moscow police will have shut down the Garden Ring .
It &apos;s too late . Shut it down .
1 , mission window is closed . Reaper is out of here
Get me Operations .
Get Mike Collins looped in .
The last person I want to see .
You saved ? You saved ?
Shut up . Shut up .
I &apos;m a screw-up ? I &apos;m a screw-up ?
Yeah , nothing I can do about that .
Just shut up . Try not to touch anything , all right ?
Your mom will be pleased .
Mr. Komarov .
Do you have the file on Chagarin ?
You blew a three-year op in five minutes !
Unbelievable .
We have to get this guy to a doctor . To medical attention , Jack .
Your mission is bleeding out over there .
Come on , let &apos;s move . Let &apos;s move .
Well , great , Jack .
Are you kidding me ? After what happened at the safe house ?
How come you never called and told me where you were ?
Shit .
Hey , hey
Krutoi . &apos; 
You ?
When she was little . I was working all the time .
I screwed mv kid &apos;s life up , too .
Yeah , well , that figures .
If we see this guy in control , we &apos;re gonna see the whole thing fall apart .
Someone has to stop him .
We go out to Chiapep and we do our thing .
Yeah .
It &apos;s not the Chernobvl in Switzerland , right ?
You mean Grenoble ?
One of these days , I &apos;m gonna have a long talk with you .
I &apos;m sorry your partner got killed .
I want you to know I got your back .
All right . Let &apos;s go kill some motherfuckers .
Okay , what the fuck is this ?
You &apos;ve underestimated us , Daddy dearest .
The hell is that ?
What ?
File !
No one here is speaking about uranium . Where &apos;s the file ?
That &apos;s no longer your concern .
... vou did well .
you promised to give me mv life back .
I thank you for that .
.. I &apos;m going to take yours .
That &apos;s a tough break for a good athlete .
Yeah , I know you . I know you .
Never was a file , was there , Yuri ?
It was simply bait .
Chagarin was the only one with enough
When &apos;s it not about money ?
You &apos;re out of your jurisdiction , Detective McClane , aren &apos;t you ?
Girls , we need to store some stuff in your place .
My mom baby-proofed our house for me .
He &apos;s gonna die !
Although , this CVS bag you tied around my foot
My boyfriend needs medical attention .
I wasn &apos;t attracted to you then ,
The devil wears Target .
I &apos;ll start packing ! You saddle up Chestnut .
Randy , you better drink up the rest of the that IV fluid ,
Why are you freaking out ?
Frank Delaport .
Okay , I &apos;m ready .
It &apos;ll give me time to practice my accent .
This is why we should have stayed in the hotel .
It &apos;s like you don &apos;t realize
Again .
Why don &apos;t you just hammer the nail in ?
We just ignore it , like the rain in my bedroom .
No matter how many boyfriends I bury ,
In my fantasy . I bought the building
You killed him ?
Okay , first , I believe that you have
I just explained to him the situation ,
Yo , can you fit these bad boys in your purse ?
I &apos;ll make room for them next to the hand towels .
So I said to my nanny .
I cannot miss my workout with Brian
Hi , I wasn &apos;t listening in .... . all this tile .
Who &apos;s Brian ,
And it &apos;s beyond .
Max ?
One Ab Blast Immune Boost with banana .
Thank you , Brian .
And make out with you ?
Yeah .
Has he ever bought us a juice ?
Schiller , dude , give me a life boost .
Am I saying that right ? Schiller .
I &apos;d love to see your flying lotus .
it takes the bus .
You do seem happier , Max .
How high are you right now ?
Showered Max is a pleasure to be around .
Hello , I &apos;m a member of Physique Total Body .
Anything else ?
The second he wakes up . I need to know .
Let &apos;s go piece this together -
We &apos;re on the front line .
Breaking up these drug cartels
I &apos;m still checking the trajectory on that .
And that &apos;s . .- Smart .
I &apos;ll get .. I &apos;ll get right back to you .
Hi , Sheriff . We need to talk .
You know , I heard about that .
Okay . What &apos;s that ?
Everybody knows who you are .
That I can live with .
First of all , I &apos;m gonna tell you ..
You &apos;re alive , aren &apos;t you ?
I just don &apos;t know how I can help you , Mateo .
Look , we thought they were dead .
And then he shot me
Unless you were planning on going somewhere .
Work with them .
Well , uh ..
This guy stole $ 3 million from me .
And then you can just go on your merry way .
You gonna keep pointing that gun at me , partner ?
Jet &apos;s find out where it takes US
Cole
Sure . What are the numbers ?
People
Now , what &apos;s a drug lord like Mateo
Now , people ..
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s just temporary .
I &apos;m in trouble here .
You &apos;ll be fine . Everything will be fine .
I know I shot other people , too . I just .. I just can &apos;t remember !
Shit .
What did you do with it ?
threw it in the trash
Now , sir ..
Show me where you threw the trash .
You know who Sam &apos;s old man is ?
JesUs . What &apos;d you get yourself into ?
He wants me to find the guy and hand him over .
I &apos;m gonna find this son of a bitch and hand him over .
You and I have seen enough dead bodies of people
I just need a little time to get out from underneath this .
I &apos;ll tell you what I &apos;m gonna do .
It was all about the money , huh , Chris ?
Now get me the fucking money !
You know , maybe we should just get married .
Things work out , maybe I &apos;ll even get you a boob job .
Yeah , Mike ?
Ie &apos;s a monster .
He raped me .. again and again .
You promised to help me get out of here .
Drop your fuckin &apos; guns .
Put it down , motherfucker !
Did you miss me ?
You seriously fucked up my day , son .
You dumb shit . We could have been partners on this .
Well , next time you better kill me all the way .
Don &apos;t strain yourself .
Or why you killed the kid !
All I care about is the goddamn money !
Now where &apos;s the rest ? !
Now , where exactly did you put it ? !
With all this head-trauma shit , I can &apos;t remember .
I think we found our guy .
It &apos;s now in the parking garage at The Streamline Bus Station .
Yes , well , a liar &apos;s word is worthless , even ON paper .
And you wouldn &apos;t be gone for two years .
Well , they were from Bedford and they didn &apos;t have me aboard .
I will captain my own ship ..
Up to them all we &apos;d ever have is a patch of dirt
He wanted things for his family , for himself .
Dreamed of the sea and never got to sea with men like them .
It &apos;s all I know .
Please come back ... . promise me .
I promise .
To be a captain , you cannot be a friend , you are their superior .
Thank you , son .
Without us , without you , the world plunges into darkness .
That wondrous monster of a mighty length ;
O Father , grant that your glorious light shine on these men ,
So , what month is this ?
Which is why my friend Barzillai and I got a berth .
Nice piece of work , Mr. Chase !
Corn , Mr. Chase ?
That &apos;s odd .
That &apos;s right , he did .
Corn , okra , beans , I believe ? Before he went to jail .
orphaned due to his father &apos;s incarceration ?
That &apos;s a motive to not ask too many questions .
You had Nantucket &apos;s great seafaring family to adopt you .
No , Sir , not for me .
No , Sir , like I said , sometimes the fewer questions one asks , the better .
I always thought you were married anyway .
Well , that &apos;s her nose anyway .
There &apos;ll be six men to a boat , first rules in the row , six bells sharp .
What &apos;s your name ?
He &apos;s the Captain &apos;s cousin , Sir .
I don &apos;t know who all of you are , or how you got here ,
and one thing only , and that is whale oil .
And even when the weather is fine and there ARE no whales , Mr. Coffin ,
You need to make up the time before we catch the east wind .
Belay that , set stuns &apos;s .
Aye , Sir .
Sir , a squall on the starboard route , we need to shorten the sail immediately .
Let it come , the men are soft from months on land , they
Chase , we will stand on .
Holding course , Sir .
Best prepare for weather , Mr. Bond , we &apos;re headed into a squall .
Stand down , Mr. Chase .
Holding course , Sir .
We need to cut those sails down !
No , the damage is done !
Capitian Clemente Pelaez , the Santa Maria .
Same as always , George .
How far out ?
How far would that be ?
in offshore grounds .
More than you &apos;ve ever dreamt .
Where is he ?
Without a map , compass or quadrant there &apos;s no way to be certain .
This is what I wanted you to see .
waiting for a ship .
No ship is going to come .
How long do you think it would take to trust the birds
And to be able to prepare for it ..
or a chance to say goodbyes , without a chance to make peace ...
But alas , at least those are settled between us
He told them the truth .
but the inquiry was a sham .
He ran a second ship around off of Hawaii ..
Horrors that you remember
You &apos;re supposed to take the form
Freeing you to do what all Kree must .
We &apos;ve given you a great gift .
I want to serve .
What was given can be taken away .
We &apos;ll know soon enough .
Serve well , and with honor .
and we get out , leaving them none the wiser .
We are not to interfere with them ,
Proceed with caution .
This is a dangerous mission .
For the good of all Kree !
Repeat .
No . This is a perfect spot for an ambush .
We can get past the locals .
Too risky .
No , you won &apos;t .
Do you hear that , too ?
Got it .
Interesting .
Go back right before this . Go back .
This is it . Now let me see where you &apos;re headed .
Did you call this in ?
Excuse me , miss .
Witness says she was dressed for laser tag .
I &apos;d like to ask you some questions .
Could I see some identification , please ?
We don &apos;t carry our identification on little cards .
You think I &apos;m one of those green things .
You are looking at 100 % red-blooded Earth man .
We talking cheek swab or urine sample ?
Want my AOL password ?
Light-speed engine ?
Well , it &apos;s still early .
Well , I won &apos;t tell your boss if you don &apos;t tell mine .
The Accusers completed their operation ...
Give us their location .
By bombing them out of the galaxy ?
Auntie Carol ?
I knew it ! Everyone said you were dead !
I &apos;m not really who you think I am .
Green transforming aliens ? There &apos;s no such thing .
There is no such thing .
Okay , then let &apos;s do this .
The person you most admire and respect , I &apos;d guess .
And what is your earliest memory of Hala ?
Blue blood running through my veins .
That &apos;s my blood that &apos;s coursing through her veins .
You &apos;re too late .
For the good of all Kree , Commander ,
You know , you really shouldn &apos;t have that thing on your lap .
And as long as he continues to freak you out
Can I ask you something ?
Well , I have to see it first .
Is this normal , like , space turbulence ?
Locking in on coordinate grid .
It &apos;s here . It &apos;s gotta be here .
They got in her head . Just like we thought .
You can see they &apos;re not soldiers .
And the core ?
I made you the best version of yourself .
Back here ! Move , move !
Let &apos;s go ! Go , move !
Sheldon , we &apos;ve been through this .
Afraid not . Do you recognize this ?
Indeed , the roommate agreement .
&quot; Number 37 : in the event one friend is ever invited
Yeah . We also put in what happens
Is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend ?
I mean , come on . What would you guys do if you were me ?
Seriously ?
And I &apos;d leave him there .
Uh , let &apos;s see .
Yeah , just think , &quot; little boys , little boys . &quot;
Oh , hey . Sheldon . We &apos;re kind of in the middle of something .
Sheldon , come home !
I don &apos;t know what you &apos;re talking about .
My piercing , blue eye .
Fine .
Not me not wanting one , not you having one with Zack .
And if he brings it up , change the subject
But not the Cornhuskers . Do not discuss the Cornhuskers .
Never mind , you &apos;re good .
Hi . Hey . Slugger .
Leonard .
Ah , well , you know , I &apos;ve been taking vitamins .
Can I get you something to drink ? Maybe a beer ?
Okay .
Leonard wants to have a baby with my ex-boyfriend Zack .
Uh , same words , just less angry .
It &apos;s strange here , too , and we have a bakery for dogs .
I support my husband .
But , you know , if you think differently ,
Yes .
Not to brag , but I &apos;m an astronaut ,
Please , I &apos;m , like , 90 pounds .
Okay , I just need you guys to sign these waivers ,
Is this a waiver or a screenplay you &apos;ve been working on ?
Absolutely . It &apos;s to protect us in case of injury .
Done .
Dressing rooms are in the back .
Here you go .
If you don &apos;t want to do this ,
Looks like he does .
Why not just be honest ?
I should be honest .
That was a long run .
You know , and then in a diner
Well , I took a nap next to Hot Dog on a Stick .
I think you &apos;re mad at me and Leonard ,
Have you seen any of these men ?
Pull over up there .
But I thought you said
Do you want some water ?
I don &apos;t know where he is .
Maybe you &apos;ll get to be employee of the month .
There &apos;s been a change in venue .
I finally get to talk to the brains of the outfit .
So you &apos;re thinking public place , safety in numbers ,
Get outta here shoo fly
This is my house
He &apos;s gonna get us out of here .
Oh. sorry to hear that .
I &apos;m sure something will come up before long .
Here .
What &apos;s this for ?
Or it &apos;s gonna be your funeral .
I don &apos;t know how to reach him , I swear .
I &apos;ve had many foot-washers .
I am not trying to hurt you . I am trying to save you .

Stay where you are .
Oh , mighty Nicolas Cage tree ,
See ya .
We just started .
I take my plus-one long sword ,

You will . You are the exact kind of woman

Our budget is tiny , and every cent goes towards
All I &apos;m saying is , if I was an addict ,

You always take them .
Well , thank goodness I have the most talented partner .
Let &apos;s get hammering .
I &apos;ve just seen too many cases
Well , I just think our society &apos;s gotten too soft .
You do realize you &apos;re not on trial
Tell me what &apos;s going on , or I &apos;m walking out of this house .
I don &apos;t believe this .
I &apos;m not going down this road again .
Do you have any idea who that is ?
She &apos;s Doris Hammond ,
Bill Hammond &apos;s widow ?
Why is she here ?
Yeah , it &apos;s great .
I guess I just have to get comfortable
So , Carlos ..
I ... work for a nonprofit that helps recovering addicts .
Was Carlos talking about his charity ?
You &apos;ll have to excuse my wife .

I mean , it &apos;s worth ...
That &apos;s what it &apos;s worth . No , no .

I mean , yeah , there are people that can do this sort of thing ,
Is it two hours already ?
Donate it to a good cause , help someone out .
Mrs. Pulcher ,
I need at least 100 grand to get things started .
Take it somewhere else , Sally Struthers ,
So she &apos;s definitely a lot worse than we thought .
But she &apos;s declining so fast .
Why can &apos;t we just give her the medicine on the side
She &apos;s in heart failure .
She needs surgery now ?
Yeah , looks like I &apos;m stuck with you , too , huh ?
One more lap .
She &apos;s my new physical therapist
Altman &apos;s . She &apos;s being ridiculous .
So you stole her charts ?

Do you really wanna see that ?
No one can do anything without backup from the American government .
Well then , I guess my only option is to
She can tell them I got lost and missed my flight .
I need some breakfast .
I &apos;m the Tin Man . Can you talk ?
It &apos;s time to say goodbye .
You know , I didn &apos;t really care about independence .
And ..
Trust me ,
Just as I thought , you haven &apos;t a clue .
So that &apos;s what Ada meant .
Creatures broke through
Cease fire . Cease fire .
What will you gain by killing me ?
Who will lead the country once you gain independence ?
I have no intention of taking advice
We don &apos;t have time to fight amongst ourselves
Oh , great . It just keeps getting better .

She didn &apos;t put her weight in her heel
I am so over them .
They are out .
What a power trip .
Are you kidding me ? She &apos;s the power center here .
What &apos;s the difference ?
She &apos;s the top of the social food chain .
She says jump , they ask , &quot; Off which bridge ? &quot;
Yeah , I-I need you .
I think you should call it . H-He &apos;s been down a long time .
I think I got a faint pulse .
I got to open him up now . If I don &apos;t , he &apos;s dead .
We don &apos;t have a fallback plan here .
This is not a matter of confidence , okay ?
I am saying that , with the pelvis that I have left ,

But I will say this .
I cannot allow a man to criticize my private conduct .
I &apos;d prefer to go at once .
Very well , Miss Everdene .
