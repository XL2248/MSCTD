So , Der@@ ek , please ..
You want a ride home ?
I was about as good a friend to him
I-@@ I-@@ I just .. moved out
And Dr. Web@@ ber said I should talk to you .
I didn &apos;t know him long ,
He had tremend@@ ous potential .
You know , he was imp@@ ati@@ ent .
He wanted to save more lives .
And he was thou@@ ght@@ ful and generous .
I think he was hero@@ ic and noble .
And I think he gave you good reason
I just wanted to say good@@ ni@@ gh@@ t. night .
Ye@@ ah . Dr. Web@@ ber and I go way back , hu@@ h ?
Ye@@ ah . You know , I hate to say it ,
So you know how to do s@@ ut@@ ures , right , Dr. M@@ ck@@ ee ?
Great . Good seeing you , chief .
It &apos;s , u@@ h , it &apos;s my eigh@@ th .

A te@@ ther@@ ed sp@@ inal cord ?
Norm@@ ally the sp@@ inal cord is free at the end ,
She &apos;s not normally like this .
Andy this is a normal mo@@ m .
No. dr@@ . s@@ wen@@ der has handed you off to me .
Third .
St@@ ev@@ ens this is a good thing .
You still have cancer ,
You fre@@ ak@@ in &apos; died and then you left instructions
I &apos;m sc@@ ared of everything !
I &apos;m sc@@ ared to touch you !
And that &apos;s your fault .
that &apos;s how you stay alive .
Mir@@ anda .
I , u@@ h , don &apos;t think it &apos;s working .
You just move your ... Ye@@ ah .
I should probably get going .
.. And she &apos;s patient until she isn &apos;t .
It &apos;s pretty hard to concentrate with all the bathroom cr@@ ying
I will .
Ye@@ ah , they were on the front por@@ ch .
The card says , &quot; You don &apos;t know your power . &quot;
What happened to your arm ?
Oh . That &apos;s pretty un@@ even . You gave her this a@@ wesome swing .
Actually , she hit me with her car
We may not h@@ ook up with women ,
So , what &apos;s with this whole &quot; going out early &quot; thing .
U@@ gh , pa@@ thetic .
No , no , no , it &apos;s D@@ yl@@ an .
Oh , that is sad .
All right , you old bags ,
It &apos;s Valentine &apos;s day and my
Well , actually , we have plans .
May I have that back ?
I didn &apos;t know that real humans could have these dimensions .
Thank you .
Phi@@ l
You &apos;re in no danger .
Sli@@ p out when you can .
For the past several Valentine &apos;s ,
Cla@@ ire , you have to finish signing these contracts .
Phi@@ l ? No .
S@@ ay , maybe you could take over here for a bit .
Hi , Phi@@ l .
Appar@@ ently they have a thing like how you and your sister
Phi@@ l , look , I really appreciate this . I do .
Tur@@ ns out my admir@@ er
And if you really want to give me some confidence ,
Second of all , there is a picture of you .
I &apos;ve got a meeting .
Margaret , you &apos;re gon@@ na take Alex .
Phi@@ l , honey ,
Ah , hin@@ ge specialist . You might &apos;ve seen him around .
This whole C@@ live thing wasn &apos;t even necessary .
Rom@@ ance strong as ever .
I &apos;ve got too much going on to even think about it .
You know , he &apos;s a rich musician ,
... This has been fun , but we should , u@@ h ...
Oh , my god . Is that Rainer ?
That sounds che@@ at-@@ y .
Why ? What do you need them for ?
You keep them in here ?
Don &apos;t .
So , I heard there was going to be this big ice-@@ sk@@ ating party .
Despite our failure in Russia ,
He &apos;s a French national who &apos;s been trading illegal arms
For years , he &apos;s worked hand in hand with his brother , David .
David didn &apos;t want his brother
Oh , that poor lady . Does anyone know if she &apos;s OK ?
If Mar@@ qu@@ ez finds those plans and s@@ ells them to Az@@ ar ... B@@ oom !
Do we know his wher@@ e@@ ab@@ outs ?
Yes ! Love Berlin .
We also have int@@ el from MI@@ 6 .
Come on . Look , the letter was found in Bern@@ ad@@ ette &apos;s clos@@ et .
Are you pointing out that California
Well played .
I &apos;m here to make sure your dinner party
I &apos;m thinking ...
I &apos;m thinking you need a test@@ oster@@ one patch .
You know , cock@@ tails ,
H@@ ate to miss that .
Oh , Leon@@ ard .
One , two , three , four , five ,
They made me reveal confidenti@@ al information
I can &apos;t tell you that .
Well , come on , we won &apos;t tell anyone .
It &apos;s bad luck for the p@@ unter@@ s that they lose their money .
Ru@@ u@@ ck !
I &apos;m al@@ right . I &apos;ve just ... . just got a flat .
N@@ ah , all good . I got it .
Do you know that you &apos;re the la ..
Why don &apos;t you and your dead@@ beat husband
I can &apos;t just stand by and watch this happen .
Have you made that call ?
Once you start , there is no going back .
She knew the consequences and she did it anyway .
You want my money or not ?
Quar@@ ter of a million dollars .
We didn &apos;t have to kill her , did we ?
We could have used that money to pay Bruce .
Very convenient .
H@@ ey .
I want more .
I &apos;m Off
Your business is your own .
You got some proof for me ?
What , you don &apos;t trust me anymore ?
Answer to all your problems .
To@@ o much .
No@@ body makes a f@@ ool out of me .
I don &apos;t i@@ ke the sound of that .
You wouldn &apos;t be playing games with me , would you , Jack ?
ad me wor@@ ried for a moment .
Jet &apos;s make it 200 .
You wouldn &apos;t know of any good bars in the area , would you ?
Hi , Bruce .
Oh , she has@@ n &apos;t showed up for work yet .
You know anything about a crash ?
No . Should T
This thing has insurance job written all over it .
Well , that &apos;s the easy part .
Hot a chance .
I &apos;ll keep the memory card
Is@@ n &apos;t that over your wife &apos;s dead body ?
You &apos;ve got a bad attitude .
Of course , she &apos;s fat@@ ter than my el@@ eph@@ ant
&quot; Life is n@@ asty , bru@@ tish and short , &quot; as the man said .
I &apos;d have got on rather well with Hob@@ bes .
They &apos;re a weal@@ thy Pitt@@ s@@ burgh family .
Now , the thing is , there &apos;s a young woman staying with them ,
What a p@@ esti@@ l@@ ence they are .
T@@ elling them what they want to hear . Prec@@ isely .
Ex@@ ac@@ tly right . And , of course , she &apos;s a pretty young thing
Bri@@ ce Cat@@ ledge &apos;s sister Carol@@ ine
Do@@ esn &apos;t he know that scientists are among the easi@@ est to f@@ ool ?
I mean , I wat@@ ched every move , and Lord knows ,
But you hate holidays .
And besides , you &apos;ve always loved the south of France ,
The usual head@@ aches , resistance in the room .
You &apos;ve always had the measure of me , Oli@@ via .
Yes , you were very impressive .
Of all my ne@@ ph@@ e@@ ws and ni@@ eces , you &apos;re the only one , Stanley ,
If only you had a slightly mil@@ der disp@@ osition ,
Yes , he means he can toler@@ ate me .
Oh , h@@ ello . Stanley .
George . Char@@ med .
They &apos;re a great deal less g@@ ul@@ li@@ ble
Have you heard of her or ...
And I om@@ itted to mention she &apos;s here with her mother .
She held my brother &apos;s hand , and she actually made the table rise .
I thought maybe , wr@@ ist li@@ fts , but they weren &apos;t there .
As I was saying , your mother and your brother
Oh , not very . I have business elsewhere .
Ah , now , is this the girl that can read minds and such ?
It &apos;s hard to explain . She gets these mental vibr@@ ations .
Drink ? Thank you .
Now , S@@ ophie looked into my eyes
Good heav@@ ens . You think she can do it with me ?
She can predic@@ t the future . In short , she &apos;s a vision@@ ary .
She &apos;s a vision@@ ary and a vision .
Pre@@ t@@ ty young thing with a stage mother who hand@@ les the promotion ,
Well , I mean , she &apos;s not even a good actress .
Well , I thought that was quite good ,
And yet , she &apos;s a fraud , Howard .
There are five senses , and no spirit world .
And now , you &apos;re refres@@ h@@ ed .
I &apos;ve had my share .
You have the Far East on the brain .
Good evening .
I was receiving some mental impressions . Exc@@ use me .
I had an unc@@ le who dro@@ w@@ ned many years ago .
There &apos;s absolutely no way she could know that unless
There was nothing supporting this cand@@ le , no th@@ reads , no wir@@ es ,
&quot; Appar@@ ent , &quot; I think , is the key word .
I mean , I grab@@ bed the cand@@ le and found absolutely nothing supporting it .
What you see out there is what you get .
Good morning .
I &apos;m going bir@@ d-@@ watching with Bri@@ ce .
I can &apos;t think of a more in@@ ane activity ,
Where ?
We could have lunch . Chat ?
You think you &apos;ll tri@@ ck me into showing you how I dec@@ eive people .
I &apos;m sure Bri@@ ce Cat@@ ledge can live
I could just as easily ask you ,
Even if their hopes are false ,
I wonder if you get your c@@ yn@@ ic@@ ism from your grand@@ father ,
Why are you star@@ ing at me ?
You &apos;d be happ@@ ier if I was a fraud ,
If you knew how much I don &apos;t want you to be a f@@ ake .
How could you know about J@@ enny ?
A wonderful lau@@ gh .
But who wants a p@@ essi@@ mis@@ tic b@@ ore
L@@ ots of money .
We &apos;re talking half a billion dollars .
Not a good position you find yourself in , is it ?
You &apos;re just caught in the middle , aren &apos;t you ?
That &apos;s what I thought .
absolutely .
I feel like I can get through to him .
I imagine he needs it in there .
Michael suffered from a couple of things .
Sorry . I &apos;m not familiar with the term .
But where we just process the image of a lamp ,
Their bra@@ ins are more open to in@@ coming stim@@ uli in the surrounding environment .
We have to do it in order to keep our san@@ ity .
Do you think Michael &apos;s a gen@@ ius ?
The loss of both parents very often does that to a child .
He became very att@@ un@@ ed to all the suffering around him .
He became a res@@ cu@@ er ,
If &apos;s in my nature to want to help .
You did a lot of good things before you were in here .
What happened ?
All right .
Who ? A@@ very ? No .
Maybe .
Ok@@ ay , fine . Your work &apos;s suffering so bad ,
Maybe next time , you keep it to yourself .
In a marriage ? Yes . You keep your mouth shut .
She has what , u@@ h , if you squ@@ int real hard ,
Ye@@ ah , she had that incident with the hole in the glo@@ ves .
I didn &apos;t know how much it fre@@ aked her out .
She &apos;ll be p@@ iss@@ y , but she &apos;ll get over it .
She &apos;s on her service .
I need to put a g@@ astro@@ -@@ j on the schedule .
That means I have to work late .
And to the people who count on you for support .
Thank you .
Did she ?
And you &apos;re gon@@ na be invited ... plus one .
No , bri@@ des are wei@@ rd . Go think about something else .
Ok@@ ay .
Well , if Yang can get her act together .
Please .
We &apos;re not talking about me . We &apos;re talking about him .
He has a very nice father .
This is a baby .
I mean , he &apos;s a baby .
Do you think that because I have kids ,
Now you want me to shut down my entire study ,
You don &apos;t have to actually date the woman she cho@@ oses .
That &apos;s why she &apos;s doing this , St@@ an .
You need to tell her yourself .
Because she li@@ stens to you .
Besides , this is not such a terrible idea .
A b@@ unch of women she sc@@ ared up on the internet ?
It &apos;s taking her mind off what &apos;s actually happening .
She thinks she can find someone to replace her ?
No@@ body can possibly replace .. her .
Why is this happening ?
I can &apos;t . I don &apos;t have a con@@ du@@ it to put in him .
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s gon@@ na last that long .
Ok@@ ay , let &apos;s put him on an os@@ c@@ ill@@ ator .
As they were incorrectly s@@ lic@@ ed ,
The supermarket was out of my regular fabric sof@@ tener .
That &apos;s thinking ahead .
That &apos;s just remember@@ ing .
A@@ my &apos;s changed .
Oh , no . Why ?
But recent events indicate that
No , it &apos;s chil@@ ly outside . Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t bring my jacket .
What kind of super@@ hero needs a jacket ?
Di@@ bs on the red ti@@ ghts ! &quot;
You got a number for a c@@ ab ?
B@@ et I got you beat .
There &apos;s no way you could beat this one .
Happy birthday !
You know , food for the wor@@ ms ?
20-@@ something years ago ?
There is no River &apos;s Ed
Un@@ less you like old wi@@ ves &apos; t@@ ales .
Don &apos;t sho@@ vel that sh@@ it to these kids , Lu@@ cky .
If you believe stories for idi@@ ots and mor@@ ons .
It &apos;s a long shot , but we m@@ apped something a few days
See this path through the forest ?
Stop right there .
Look , don &apos;t get the wrong idea .
What the hell is that ?
The de@@ ed you have to this house is
they sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be here , Nick .
You said you &apos;d been sw@@ ing@@ ing a ham@@ mer in here for years .
I &apos;ve been trying to te@@ ar it down .
You tell you friend to run as fast and as
And you run with him , and never come back .
You come back here , it &apos;ll be the ast thing you &apos;ll ever
What the hell are these guys ?
Ry@@ an ?
What ?
He didn &apos;t say anything !
Get the fu@@ ck off of him .
Did he say something to you or not ?
Ye@@ ah , well , they know how to throw a fu@@ cking ax@@ e .
Or he &apos;s just some h@@ ill@@ bil@@ ly lun@@ atic who thinks the state &apos;s
Oh , sh@@ it !
Trust me , no one .
Forest , ra@@ vine , car ?
Come on , we &apos;d never make it by dark .
Well , I would rather go into the woods than stay inside
We don &apos;t need to broadcast ourselves .
H@@ ey , h@@ ey , h@@ ey , h@@ ey , h@@ ey .
Stop it .
It &apos;s so good to see you with your eyes open .
30 minutes ?
U@@ h , he and L@@ illi@@ th went to the van .
You were tou@@ ching the tree .
How would I see anyone ?
was tou@@ ching a tree .
You said you never wanted to touch him &apos; cause you never
Is that what gave you the sei@@ z@@ ure ?
I remember when I used to call you that .
What are you doing in there ?
Your father , Nick@@ y .
The door to the cellar ,
I &apos;m not beautiful anymore .
What do you mean ?
I think you &apos;re looking at a door
W@@ anna give this a try ?
They &apos;re all over the place .
They &apos;re all over out there , just looking
Where the fu@@ ck do we go ?
We only have the cellar .
It &apos;s the door .
What the fu@@ ck do we do ?
Come on .
Where the hell are we going ?
You mean , if you hope it &apos;s still there .

We got@@ ta find the girls .
What are you doing ?
Come on , we got@@ ta find the girls .
It &apos;s a po@@ ison angel .
Come on .
We can find .... we can cover more ground .
There &apos;s a g@@ loss@@ ary of dem@@ ons .
She is the queen of hell .
They can feel stress , remember ?
That &apos;s all it is .
he &apos;s just fre@@ aking out &apos; cause I am .
It &apos;s me , Ev@@ ie .
Don &apos;t make any noise , OK ?
We have to go to the house .
It &apos;ll just be a few more minutes .
Ok@@ ay , I am de@@ ath@@ ly afraid of a lot of po@@ o .
Two kids sh@@ it the van on the way here and we still made it .
So just calm down .
It &apos;s dead !
Pi@@ ece of sh@@ it Bo@@ ost Mobile .
Oh my God , it &apos;s In@@ dependence Day .
Oh , wait , maybe North Korea &apos;s inv@@ aded !
I hope they got a Mc@@ Donald &apos;s in here ,
Come on . I know Gi@@ u@@ cci &apos;s down@@ stairs , let &apos;s go .
How do you think an alien would do against this ?
I got you , brother .
Hur@@ ry up .
I got &apos; em ! I got &apos; em !
Oh , sh@@ it , he passed out again .
I should &apos;ve pushed harder .
And ...
Look , I know what you &apos;re thinking ,
You sure it has@@ n &apos;t started already ?
I &apos;ve seen at you &apos;re capable of ,
I saw the two of you in the courtyard this morning .
He started with me .
Not me .
Who wanted him dead besides you ?
How many times have I had you at g@@ un@@ point ?
Hell
We only been out here a minute .
The so@@ oner W@@ hi@@ st@@ ler dies ,
What difference does it make ?
No more sur@@ prises , Lincoln .
Can you get any more pictures of S@@ ara ?
You didn &apos;t tell him .
Can we get pictures or not ?
He seems a little sensitive to me .
Leave my son .
Is that what this is ?
Ye@@ ah , I &apos;m sure it was really hard
I was looking forward to seeing you
Made up your mind yet , Alex ?
Once the special
What about a special prosec@@ ut@@ or ?
It &apos;s a form@@ ality .
This is just a form@@ ality ?
But the Justice Department

Well , well .

He &apos;s gone south a long way from here . I &apos;ll take you to him , I promise .
Get up . We &apos;re leaving
I was gon@@ na do that anyway and you would &apos;ve heard me
You w@@ anna know so bad
It &apos;s starting to hurt .
Let &apos;s put that band@@ age back on .
You got any fuel ?
What &apos;s wrong with Australian money ?
It &apos;s paper . It &apos;s wor@@ th@@ less .
It &apos;s a piece of fu@@ cking paper !
How much you need , man ?
Ye@@ ah
Thank you kind@@ ly .
You act like they &apos;re doing you a favor to let you work there ,
I know everything , Jer@@ ry .

You have the greatest hair , Tom .
Do you w@@ anna go ?
On Friday night . I &apos;ll pick you up after work .
Or just meet there , then ?
There &apos;s a show
This is exactly who you are
What do you think ? David lost it .
I don &apos;t believe you .
I told him you were leaving ..
Because you wouldn &apos;t have .
What , she didn &apos;t come to pick you up ?
H@@ ey , I &apos;m here as a friend . Nothing else .
Mo@@ ve over .
But funny ,
Why would you keep that a secret ?
I was ash@@ amed , ok@@ ay ?
And I h@@ ated what I did .
So that &apos;s it ? You &apos;re just gon@@ na walk away ?
But I &apos;m not gon@@ na spend my entire life pro@@ ving that I am .
You don &apos;t fight for love .
No . I &apos;m just missing home .
It &apos;s slow and it &apos;s painful , but it works .
Go@@ ing out with other people , seeing friends .
Anne , please .
U@@ h , no , I didn &apos;t .
It &apos;s why I called Hel@@ en and she said she never got my letter .
How could you have fallen this far ?
Two tickets .
This isn &apos;t over , Ta@@ de
And I don &apos;t think you have either .
Do you love him like you love me ?
No , it must have been K@@ eit@@ h .
When the CD player ble@@ w , we had to bring all the records down@@ stairs .
What are you doing in here ?
Oh , look at this . You scrat@@ ched it .
D@@ ad , they &apos;re just records .
He &apos;s not here to ask , is he ?
tried to war@@ n you .
I know it &apos;s not your fault .
Is@@ n &apos;t that always the way ?
in a gospel band .
Me and my Gi@@ b@@ son and Jesus were gon@@ na rock the world .
Those were the days , though .
What &apos;s with the clothes ?
I meant why are they fol@@ ded ?
O@@ oh , what &apos;s this ?
O@@ oh , I have an idea .
Oh , that would be so much fun .
O@@ oh , and get our hair done , and s@@ low-@@ dance .
You went to seven pro@@ ms ?
U@@ h , four &quot; Under the Se@@ as , &quot; Two &quot; En@@ chan@@ ted E@@ ven@@ ings , &quot;
She and A@@ my are out dress shopping for their pro@@ m thing .
E@@ ver since I saw Pre@@ t@@ ty in Pink ,
But then I saw Never Be@@ en Kis@@ sed ,
Ber@@ nie &apos;s really excited .
You know , if you &apos;re not gon@@ na learn how to do this ,
Bruce Wa@@ yne doesn &apos;t make his ro@@ omm@@ ate tie it for him .
There , perfect .
It &apos;s my first pro@@ m , I want to do it correctly .
I was , but Penn@@ y didn &apos;t want to .
Bern@@ ad@@ ette , A@@ my ,
Was that a flas@@ k ?
I &apos;ve decided to em@@ bra@@ ce all of the traditions
Oh , no , this is p@@ om@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate juice .
So , anything else planned for ton@@ ight ?
Get@@ ting our picture taken , s@@ low-@@ dancing ,
It &apos;s gon@@ na be off the h@@ ook .
Why would you say that ?
because a lot of people lose their vir@@ g@@ inity on pro@@ m night .
Is this true ?
You don &apos;t have hormon@@ es .
Try not to touch it when you &apos;re dancing .
Where are you going ?
You &apos;re making me worry .
What &apos;s going on is we &apos;re about to go to a pro@@ m .
What pressure ?
Can you please open the door ?
Leon@@ ard and Penn@@ y also made comments about it .
Even I looked twice when I saw my post@@ eri@@ or
She passed me the Man@@ isch@@ ew@@ itz ,
So , my mother &apos;s ok@@ ay with this ?
Because they have a wei@@ rd , in@@ appropriate relationship .
If you pull this off , you can come up to my room later ..
Just make sure we get paid .
Now , we &apos;ve been negoti@@ ating this for months .
I &apos;ve agreed to meet you here .
Be right back .
Let me give you a little bit of advice .
Watch your step with that thing .

Michael
So where &apos;s your new best friend ?
But W@@ hi@@ st@@ ler &apos;s not who you think he is .
You &apos;re the first that &apos;s ever done that . Gra@@ ci@@ as .
You could choose not to .
Michael Sco@@ field left me for dead ...
What is Spanish for &quot; little angel &quot; ?
Who worked for the Company for about ten years .
Do you know what S@@ cy@@ lla is ?
So he was going to make a copy of it and give it to me .
You &apos;re looking at major time .
So how would you like to walk away from it al ..
If you help me find her ..
I &apos;m sorry , she &apos;s not my department , S@@ cy@@ lla is .
It seems to me ..
Of course .
Only a few people in government will know of the operation .
Or people &apos;s lives will be in danger , mine included .
I &apos;m going to get you help .
Ye@@ ah , but maybe you can .
Fern@@ ando Su@@ c@@ re , and Bra@@ d Bel@@ lick were arrested .
And Alexander Mah@@ one is in a Colorado j@@ ail cell .
And you &apos;ll have me .
W@@ hi@@ st@@ ler also said something about a second step ,
But it &apos;s encryp@@ ted .
So , we &apos;ve got a data card , which could be anywhere .
The location of which has yet to be determined .
He heard from contacts that I could be trusted .
Why now ?
Ok@@ ay ? When W@@ hi@@ st@@ ler was killed yesterday ...
But , u@@ h ..
So this is like job security for you ?
You can collect your pension .
Ok@@ ay , some people still care about their job .
Maybe you &apos;ve been a little too dist@@ rac@@ ted ..
If we take this deal , we &apos;ll both be dead ...
You guys must have some big@@ -@@ time friends .
Som@@ ebo@@ dy just posted ...
You can &apos;t hide .
How high is your threshold for pain ?
We &apos;re gon@@ na go into the night .
Ligh@@ ter somehow .
I don &apos;t even know who they are .
No more updates .
Welcome to Los ang@@ les .
You need to keep your heads down and your ears open .
All the basic nec@@ essi@@ ties to get you up and running .
On a co@@ p &apos;s sal@@ ary or pul@@ ling weekend gig@@ s as a driver .

And taking six figures from a private security company ..
And then I can pick the guy out from there .
Mexican Desert , 60 miles south of US border .
Oh , I don &apos;t want to die out here .
Why don &apos;t we rest here for a while , hu@@ h ?
S@@ i , that sounds good .
To San Diego .
What does that mean ?
What if we don &apos;t have to be in the house ?
Maybe the guy is carrying it on him .
Heavy h@@ itter like that &apos;s gon@@ na have security 24-@@ 7 .
Without anyone knowing it &apos;s gone , right ?
You don &apos;t ste@@ al the card .
Oh , now you &apos;re interested in what I got@@ ta say , right ?
Not only do you have to ste@@ al it .
Only if you don &apos;t got me , hom@@ bre .
This is the reason I got bu@@ sted .
I &apos;m looking at federal time cause I st@@ ole a cell phone , seriously ?
It looks like a cell phone but it &apos;s really like ...
Wireless hard drive that swal@@ lows up any electronic data ...
Like what ?
Of anyone at St@@ arb@@ u@@ cks with a lat@@ te and a laptop .
I can walk out of here and get the identi@@ ties .
On a slow day , with one hand on my j@@ unk .
If we can get close enough ...
I sh@@ ame you in front of your cow@@ or@@ kers here .
C@@ ould be anywhere , I don &apos;t know .
Right ?
You know , if you go down this road .
Then I better not get caught , right ?
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m gon@@ na do .
We just got to keep talking . San@@ cho .
Our empty bel@@ lies and our dry mou@@ ths , ok@@ ay ?
Let &apos;s start with , u@@ h , your@@ -@@ your favorite color .
Why should the both of us die out here .
You don &apos;t want to do this . Please .
San@@ cho .
It must be in there , right ?
In that house without being seen .
Well , if the card &apos;s in there , how we gon@@ na copy it ?
She &apos;s gon@@ na do it for US .
&quot; There is no fighting her . &quot;
I &apos;m a teacher , and I have books and gra@@ ding materials and ...
In a wag@@ on one of these days .
It has so many po@@ ckets .
Oh , no .
Ah , thank God , thank God .
Ye@@ ah , my dam@@ n truck ble@@ w a g@@ ask@@ et a few miles back .
We &apos;ve been receiving some , u@@ h ..
We &apos;d like you to check the windows , please .
All the windows ?
Every room in the house .
Does she still have the bag ?
She &apos;s got it .
I need to know who .
For@@ mer aid to Governor Frank Tan@@ cre@@ di .
We looked everywhere .
Like I said , I can &apos;t read the content ..
Do@@ esn &apos;t matter if we got it if we can &apos;t find it .
It &apos;s still inside the house .
She must have found it .
And then she left it behind .
You know how many months ...
What , you just think I can w@@ hip up another one in a couple seconds ?
If they find it , that &apos;s the problem .
What do you mean , done ? What does that mean ?
Are they gon@@ na kill US ?
If we had a few days , we &apos;ll figure out a way to pull this off .
Ye@@ ah , you gather right .
You got@@ ta throw Us a bone .
What you &apos;re asking for requires involving additional people .
I cannot do .
No , what I &apos;m asking for is competence , ok@@ ay ?
In the hands of a dam@@ n ma@@ id .
That &apos;s it , Michael , that &apos;s ball game .
About the Company , what ..
You know , u@@ h , the one thing I remember most ..
Always walking out the front door .
M@@ om , US , himself .
Was his belief that the Company needed to be taken down .
Then this is our fight , not thei@@ rs .
These guys chose to be here .
They got a choice .
Where the brothers were alle@@ ge@@ dly sent .
And no one has been released during that time .
I &apos;m just trying to find out who .
I know you b@@ ailed them out .
How &apos;s that ?
Because you &apos;re gon@@ na say you &apos;re fine , that you can handle it .
I &apos;ll just leave it at this .
Wh@@ enever you want to talk , I &apos;m here .
You were gon@@ na bl@@ ame yourself .
And , I can &apos;t bear the thought of that .
And just wi@@ pe the sl@@ ate clean and no gu@@ ilt and no responsibility ?
I don &apos;t want it to be out of a sense of obligation .
Because of what we &apos;ve been through .
Start over .
Our flight time to Atlanta is approximately 52 minutes .
So what did you do last night ?
All right , here we go .
We need to get a move on .
I am sw@@ amp@@ ed . I can &apos;t just leave .
We don &apos;t work at the salon .
U@@ h-@@ hu@@ h . I &apos;m sorry .
Did you say I act like my job is life and death ?
Ye@@ ah , that &apos;s right .
Which remin@@ ds me , I have a customer waiting .
No , I &apos;ll call you later .
David , you &apos;re z@@ oning out again .
So let me get this straight .
Dead men don &apos;t swe@@ at , do they , Doctor ?
Have a trace of blood , as well .
What &apos;d you find in his po@@ ckets ?
This old not@@ ebook ,
See how far you get .
Maybe you ought to keep that to yourself .
Ye@@ ah . Ye@@ ah , it &apos;s worth a shot .
Hal@@ f the people that work up there are the walking dead anyway .
U@@ h , I got the DNA results
Ho@@ dges has a proposal :
He also wants you to know
That &apos;s all you have for us ?
but not without one big , fat sc@@ andal .
At least until one of his students
So the government didn &apos;t want to step on the to@@ es
There &apos;s got to be a connection .
He still receives a government pension check .
Hello , Doctor .
Dr. A@@ den ?
You got the wrong guy .
We found something of yours .
Ban@@ ished me from university property .
It &apos;s Phil@@ o Far@@ n@@ s@@ worth all over again !
In the pocket of , u@@ h , this young man .
U@@ h-@@ u@@ h .. He &apos;s dead ?
Actually , the young man in question ...
The Laz@@ arus my@@ th made real ?
It &apos;s , u@@ h ...
In your , um , re-@@ animation experiments , Doctor ,
C@@ ould almost reach out and touch it .
The ma@@ el@@ strom .
Exc@@ ept the third person looks like a woman .
What have they done ?
Dr. A@@ den , slow down .
No need to add bag@@ gage to your trip .
It &apos;s going to be an adventure .
See you on re-@@ entry .
Max &apos;s friends Kurt and Alice .
See who his co-@@ pil@@ ots were .
You know , in the movie Alter@@ ed States ,
You wouldn &apos;t want to go v@@ ent@@ uring
I noticed some f@@ ain@@ t bru@@ ising that started to develop
Hand marks . He was held down .
So dro@@ w@@ ning is CO@@ D ?
Ye@@ ah , great for a h@@ itter , bad for pron@@ ounc@@ ing death .
What are you looking for , Do@@ c ?
The way you &apos;ve got it set , it wouldn &apos;t pick up my hear@@ t@@ beat .
You &apos;re lucky you &apos;re not ben@@ ched .
Why do you ask ?
Well , I would have to know more about
I want you to look at something .
Ton@@ ight , we free ourselves from the physical plane .
She &apos;s got some academic hon@@ ors awards
Do@@ esn &apos;t take a det@@ ective .
O@@ oh , another one of Dr. A@@ den &apos;s not@@ ebooks .
Dr. A@@ den said this was going to end b@@ adly .
L@@ et-@@ s hope there &apos;s still time for Alice .
It is a dat@@ e-@@ tag match to a formula
Right .
So how did Alice get it ?
He and Alice were e-mail bud@@ dies .
When her mother died .
Alice saw an an@@ onymous comm@@ enter
So she e-@@ mails ,
So , here . Kurt &apos;s just wander@@ ing campus .
Some kind of inter@@ ference .
I &apos;m working on isol@@ ating the comp@@ eting image ,
Are we looking through Alice &apos;s camera ?
Where is she , and what &apos;s she doing ?
What , a car stopped for her ?
Wi@@ pers , off .
AP@@ U Fire Protection Test Button , check .

We still need confirmation on this .
Years later ,
And that is how people learned that Fel@@ ic@@ ia T@@ ill@@ man
I like anything that &apos;s not orange .
Your settlement check came in .
After all these years in prison ,
What ? To your old neighborhood ?
N@@ one of your neighb@@ ors supported you during the trial .
Oh , I don &apos;t hate them ...
And so my husband returned to W@@ ist@@ eria Lan@@ e .
They h@@ ad@@ n &apos;t thought about Paul Young in years .
And he was going to make sure
The letter that arri@@ ves by special cour@@ ier ..
Yes , there are all sor@@ ts of ways
Why do I have to tell them ?
Tru@@ ste@@ es of the hospital feel
&quot; Great block party .
Again , very sorry .
He is gon@@ na be so angry !
You &apos;ll never gu@@ ess who &apos;s back !
How is Paul even out of j@@ ail ?
Hello , ladies .
I &apos;ll tell you the story .
It &apos;s a good one .
Why are you so surprised ?
Oh , wait . That &apos;s right .
I told myself I &apos;d explain how I was framed
In@@ no@@ cent or not , that guy still gives me the cre@@ eps .
And he &apos;s using my shower .
You here for your 9 iron ? Dam@@ n , I thought if I sha@@ ved ,
You look a little pa , bud@@ dy . Some@@ thing wrong ?
Jack , what &apos;s going on here , man ?
Let &apos;s just go inside , h@@ mm ?
Then we &apos;re not telling gab@@ y ,
She has to be told .
but I don &apos;t know how .
N@@ ope . I was wrong . P@@ rest@@ on ,
When ren@@ ee pul@@ ls up to this house .
It &apos;s So ... CO@@ zy and intimate and ...
You &apos;re learning a lot of new words for &quot; small . &quot;
Sometimes weeks go by without me
Lyn@@ ette , why so mean ?
Drive s@@ lower next time .
It &apos;s all right . We &apos;re just old friends re@@ connecting .
They work from their own homes .
That sounds like a dream job .
You said you had money problems .
Un@@ to Mar@@ tha for selling her dignity
Look for yourself ! She &apos;s on camera three !
Just some family photos .
So are you gon@@ na be ok@@ ay ?
I lost my business , and I &apos;m sitting here
I &apos;m sorry .
It &apos;s for the best .
Well , whatever you do ..
Goo@@ d-@@ b@@ ye , B@@ ree .
I &apos;ve been thinking about our conversation last night .
I &apos;m fine .
I found myself a project .
I wanted to sp@@ it in your face .
That &apos;s right . You &apos;re not used to prison .
You &apos;re giving me a lot of reasons
I &apos;ve become a bit of an expert thanks to you .
It never hur@@ ts to tip the guard does your cav@@ ity search .
W@@ hi@@ ch@@ ever is easier .
They always record the convers@@ ations ,
That &apos;s a crazy , ground@@ less acc@@ us@@ ation .
I have things to do like shopping
U@@ h , absolutely fear@@ less .
Yes , Ren@@ ee was always the one with the fashion sense .
I &apos;d never even heard of Gu@@ C@@ ci or Pra@@ da .... .
Or Ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia .
And .. som@@ ebo@@ dy got h@@ unt .
Oh , it &apos;s not about the money .
You were adv@@ entu@@ ro@@ us .
It &apos;s just hard for me to re@@ conc@@ ile
Why would she do this ?
Two guys , hu@@ h ?
I mean , isn &apos;t her life perfect enough ?
So was it one ru@@ g@@ by guy and then the other ,
You know , I have shi@@ el@@ ded you
She doesn &apos;t get to be dis@@ appointed in my life .
Ye@@ ah . You &apos;re right . You &apos;re right .
Por@@ k ch@@ ops for dinner .
Some@@ thing wrong ?
Without that money , I can &apos;t hire any help .
We &apos;ll never get ou@@ tt@@ a here like that .
The wine ta@@ sting ?
As you may have g@@ le@@ an@@ ed ,
No , no , of course not .
H@@ old , please .
We knew they &apos;d shoot that down .
They have the luxury of being un@@ reasonable right now .
Their witness lin@@ eup is better , and they know it .
We &apos;re here .
We &apos;ll see you in court .
Hi , Sofia !
I &apos;m so sorry about this .
I &apos;m thinking p@@ anc@@ akes for breakfast .
Let me have a look there .
Get@@ ting fluid in her ab@@ dom@@ en .
This baby &apos;s bar@@ ely vi@@ able outside that wom@@ b .
You can repair it , can &apos;t you ?
Th@@ row in a plas@@ ma patch , hope for the best .
Then a patch is the way to go .
Now you &apos;re confident in a plas@@ ma patch ?
K@@ ep@@ ner ?
Stay in your lane , Dr. K@@ are@@ v .
I &apos;ll update the mo@@ m .
Well , she &apos;s still in surgery but doing great .
And the baby ?
It &apos;s too little to be born , right ?
I-@@ I need you to sign one more form
Morning ! Come on in !
I &apos;m sorry . It &apos;s been a really rough morning .
C@@ alli@@ e and I swa@@ p all the time .
C@@ ould you please tell the court the t@@ ally at the bottom ?
We know she was out with you at least 25 times .
Now , let &apos;s just p@@ ause and think about this for a minute .
150 out of 180 .
Sustain@@ ed .
So , C@@ alli@@ e &apos;s ok@@ ay sl@@ ut@@ -@@ sh@@ aming me now ?
They &apos;re making it sound like a working mo@@ m is a bad mo@@ m .
All you got@@ ta do is come and get it .
God dam@@ n it , be careful with that !
That cost a lot of money ,
No one &apos;s got a fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; name like Os@@ good .
I try to be@@ have like a gent@@ lem@@ an , Dor@@ is .
You think less of me , don &apos;t you ? For walking out
I say that &apos; cause I think it &apos;s the truth .
I lec@@ tured on economics at Y@@ ale .
I was the National Golden Glo@@ ves champion three years in a row .
Jesus !
I lie al@@ ot .
Sh@@ all we say 7 : 00 ?
It fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; worked ! It really worked .
You said I was a cow@@ ard and my breath was bad .
What was that , man ?
He@@ h , women , they like hon@@ est@@ y .
All right , fresh from the bank ..
What &apos;d I miss ? The special spec@@ im@@ en .
Ok@@ ay , she &apos;s dead , but she won &apos;t lie down .
I could get a key to a $ 1,000 suite .
Give me something I can cher@@ ish to remember .
Ok@@ ay . Thank you . Come on .
Dis@@ cs , tap@@ es .
Even if he den@@ ies it , it &apos;s something .
It &apos;s a bit late for that .
Then you &apos;ll be sub@@ po@@ en@@ a@@ ed and forced to repeat this whole story .
Then I &apos;ll give them this .
Ar@@ en &apos;t you , Frank ?
Don &apos;t look so sho@@ cked . What did you expect ?
Exc@@ ept you &apos;re not working for Lang anymore .
You know all this is point@@ less , don &apos;t you ?
Good evening , si@@ r . Ha@@ ther@@ ton welcomes you abo@@ ard .
It &apos;s my first time in a private jet .
Hi , man .
Yes , si@@ r .
Leave it off for now .
Mike would never have believed such cra@@ p . He was too cle@@ ver . To@@ o loy@@ al .
How do you know that ?
Do you mind if I don &apos;t think about that ?
I &apos;m not je@@ al@@ ous .
But at least I know she &apos;ll be having a long day at work .
I &apos;d like to see you get back under 145 .
pu@@ ke .
Some@@ what ir@@ onic .
Can you lift your shirt ? So I can examine your stomach ?
These sc@@ ars are still pink .
You did this in Mexico so your parents wouldn &apos;t know ?
And you noticed her foot tw@@ it@@ ching ?
My foot .
About three months ago ?
We took her to county hospital , and she got the C.@@ T. scan ,
A lot worse . They don &apos;t have the proper equipment back home
Right away .
Ye@@ ah , and thanks for it .
I didn &apos;t give it to you . It &apos;s all over the hospital .
Dis@@ ease , diagnosis , and pres@@ cription from one man .
This is not gon@@ na make me go home .
But I feel fine .
What ? Are you trying to get her in trouble ?
George , this program will make or break our care@@ ers , ok@@ ay ?
And that decision depends entirely
He &apos;s the atten@@ ding . He should know better .
It didn &apos;t exactly sound like
I think so , Dr. Sh@@ ep@@ herd .
Here you go , do@@ c .
We &apos;re gon@@ na put this on your arm , ok@@ ay ?
Here , we &apos;re gon@@ na put that onto you , like that .
This is a butter@@ fly .
M@@ mm , there we go . Blan@@ k@@ et for the butter@@ fly . Good . Nic@@ ely done .
H@@ ey , you like spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps ?
You do ? Ok@@ ay , should we take Captain O &apos;@@ mal@@ ley ,
It &apos;ll be saf@@ er to wait until your lunch di@@ gests
Where did you get the idea to do this ?
Hon@@ ey , there is a healthy way to lose weight .
What are you eating ?
Most of the time , when people hit their target weight ,
It &apos;s ... stres@@ s@@ ful .
I could focus more on my studies .
Life doesn &apos;t work that way , Cla@@ ire .
What ? You want to argue this ?
Left un@@ treated , the disease is gon@@ na kill her .
To@@ o soon .
The treatment requires the dise@@ ased portion
Her brain &apos;s not fully developed ,
There are risks to any surgery ,
Look , I know this is a lot to di@@ gest .
Thank you .
Yes ? What
Are you in , or not ?
Good .
We &apos;re gon@@ na cut out half a girl &apos;s brain
Almost makes it hard to hate him .
Oh , no reason .
You know ?
She knows .
We need to free the bow@@ el from the ad@@ hes@@ ions caused from the ab@@ sc@@ ess .
What was she thinking ?
She wanted to please her .
Great .
She gets good grades .
She &apos;s smart .
Come on , Taylor , she &apos;s w@@ aking up .
U@@ h , he &apos;s as@@ le@@ ep !
Dr. Taylor !
My bad , She@@ p .
A@@ w , I no@@ d@@ ded off . Come on .
St@@ eph , get me some coffee .
I &apos;ll be fine . It won &apos;t happen again .
U@@ h , St@@ eph , call Dr. Penn@@ ington .
Get out of here and get it together .
Does that mean you believe he &apos;s innocent ?
Whether it &apos;s just or not
And we will be here with you throughout the night .
How long until ..
Are his law@@ yers making any progress ?
There &apos;s only one person who can really stop this execution .
Just to tal@@ k.@@ For five minutes .
OK ..
I &apos;m told that you have to wait until final vis@@ itation .
Belie@@ ve me my father knows where I stand on the death penalty
This is ..
Just talk to Lincoln &apos;s att@@ or@@ neys
And if I &apos;m the one asking for cl@@ em@@ ency for your brother
Ye@@ ah but a secret inform@@ ant claims that Ste@@ ad@@ man is still alive ?
You &apos;re his cl@@ er@@ k just get US on the do@@ cket .
If he grants it he can order a stay until the tests come in .
No way .
We studied for the Bar day and night in that cra@@ pp@@ y little apartment of yours
Come on L@@ yle everyone knows you run that cour@@ tro@@ om .
The inform@@ ant that was killed yesterday I was there .
All we &apos;re asking is to be heard .
Thank you .
He knows you tried
So yes .
En@@ ough man all right
Back Up or I &apos;ll beat your sk@@ inny ass into the ground .
All right ladies re@@ c time is over . Back on the block !
And I will collect .
Thanks .
Let me worry about my problems .
Once about 10 years ago
And it may sound crazy
So if something happens to the chair
A new death warran@@ t another medical cle@@ arance .
Y@@ o what sc@@ rap@@ es yo ?
I know time is of the essence .
These little b@@ ast@@ ards are the bane of my existence I swe@@ ar to God .
Ye@@ ah they &apos;re attracted to the heat when they &apos;re cold
Not by che@@ wing on the wire alone but if the tail tou@@ ches metal
So can you change the f@@ use ?
Can you do it now ?
Ye@@ ah .
Make me .
Hair gets in the way or something .
I know you did .
Remember Der@@ ek ?
I said make it $ 100 .
She &apos;s supposed to be coming .
I got to get my head straight .
I can &apos;t take it anymore .
I have to see him .
You &apos;ll never make it through the gate .
I had a dream last ni@@ gh@@ t.@@ You and me were working on a house
It was so clear . The whole dream .
I know it .
Him him ?
What the fu@@ ck is he hop@@ ing to find with these los@@ ers ?
They &apos;re total sl@@ uts here .
No manager . Just the girl .
Ye@@ ah , we &apos;re coming , we &apos;re coming . Who &apos;s there ?
At the Tim@@ one D &apos;@@ Or@@ o ?
Ser@@ gio needs to finish something for work first .
Two details that will soon be resolved , Fabri@@ zio !
And you &apos;ll go back to Tar@@ an@@ to dirt poor .
It &apos;s so ol@@ d-@@ fashi@@ oned ! I haven &apos;t touched co@@ ke for a good ten years .
No , I understand .
Nothing . You weren &apos;t talking .
... Ser@@ gio Mor@@ ra .
You do everything you can to get yourself noticed .
Well , I like to keep busy .
But they &apos;re not enough anymore .
Dar@@ ling , could you look after the boy a moment ?
Lu@@ ig@@ ino , why don &apos;t you drive around over there ?
I &apos;m saying that we lost
All those broken promises ..
His collabor@@ ator sentenced to nine years for ties to the M@@ af@@ ia .
He goes abroad and says ,
Is@@ n &apos;t that true ?
He &apos;s 70 years old , C@@ up@@ a .
I know where you &apos;re headed ,
Fu@@ ck you , Sant@@ ino .
What the fu@@ ck ?
I &apos;ve never che@@ ated on Ser@@ gio .
You &apos;re a piece of sh@@ it !
Because I &apos;ll tell them everything , Sant@@ ino ,
Do you have any wishes , Ser@@ gio ?
Yes , I know , I know .
Where the hell are they going to go with that pa@@ thetic majority ?
Are you bor@@ ed , love ?
Sh@@ all we do something after the Bag@@ ag@@ lin@@ o Show , dar@@ ling ?
Ye@@ ah , Ger@@ i was delighted .
This cost me 300 euros and it looks like sh@@ it .
If only all you needed was a top to make the difference , love !
Let &apos;s hope this sh@@ it doesn &apos;t go on too long . Oh , God , here we go !
How did you know , Sil@@ vi@@ o ?
An in@@ def@@ ati@@ g@@ able lover of my cali@@ bre
On one condition .. that you don &apos;t om@@ it her name .
Tam@@ ara Mor@@ ra . Do you know her ?
A goo@@ d-@@ looking woman .
She ur@@ ged me to stand as your successor
Who@@ ever is not with me is against me .
Two things . The sal@@ es@@ man is a lon@@ ely man .
So put that aside , but don &apos;t forget it ,
August@@ o P@@ all@@ ot@@ ta , head of sales at P@@ all@@ ot@@ ta Real Estate Ltd .
Yes , ma &apos;@@ am ,
N@@ either do I , ma &apos;@@ am . If I &apos;m calling you now ,
Yes , ma &apos;@@ am , everyone dreams of own@@ ing a home .
Not because the weal@@ thi@@ est man in Italy ,
So if all these in@@ ferences of yours are not the reason ,
The problem is that , while I wa@@ ited for you , I remembered something .
What the writer Javier Mari@@ as said about you .
He said that when you attend international sum@@ mits ,
I studied whi@@ st@@ ling technique in Dubai .
And I brought her here because she &apos;s dying to meet you .
Dear Ver@@ on@@ ica ,
I have a favourite writer as well .
I don &apos;t give a sh@@ it . Round them up . You &apos;re dro@@ w@@ ning in debt , Fabri@@ zio .
You &apos;ll help me ?
I can understand that .
It seems that a sort of hand@@ book has been drawn up ,
I do as I please .
At least your j@@ ok@@ es , Sil@@ vi@@ o . C@@ ould you at least avoid telling j@@ ok@@ es ?
What about Ch@@ urch@@ ill , then ?
Was that less mel@@ o@@ dramatic ?
&quot; You were good , dear , just a sh@@ ame I couldn &apos;t hear anything ! &quot;
Fine , but remember that this b@@ im@@ bo
Maybe that &apos;s why I felt the need for compan@@ ion@@ ship .
Fine , Sil@@ vi@@ o , fine .
We &apos;ve had enough of it . And you want to know something else ?
It &apos;s not true you &apos;re as sk@@ il@@ ful as you say you are .
You are so n@@ ai@@ ve !
Do you think they &apos;re all blessed with righteousness except for me ?
They &apos;re all like me .
But I did it better than the rest of them , because I am the best .
But I have a duty to be completely honest with you .
If I come back later , it &apos;s because I won .
Why won &apos;t they let me gover@@ n ?
Instead the le@@ f@@ ti@@ st judges tor@@ ment me with trials ,
What did you expect ?
Yes , that &apos;s exactly what I expected .
Or maybe I never got on it .
A few days ago , in some magazine ,
they all look like Ver@@ on@@ ica .
One day there was a girl here .
I appro@@ ached her and she said to me ..
&quot; An@@ ch@@ or . &quot;
I believe I can do that for your vie@@ wers
I studied journ@@ alism at the University of Texas .
Good answer .
and , um , I am recently engaged .
Skel@@ et@@ ons ?
I &apos;m a good girl .
Be well . Good day . Good day .
Five minutes to air , people .
Its down to you and W@@ endy Ch@@ ang .
Mad@@ eline .
Is she done , or ... . ?
CK is one block south .
You really sh@@ ouldn &apos;t use hand san@@ i@@ tiz@@ er like that . It dri@@ es out your skin .
The one with fl@@ oral or the one with fl@@ oral ?
They can be so bad sometimes .
Th@@ ro@@ wing things , h@@ itting me .
W@@ ere you smoking ?
Do you want some p@@ anc@@ akes ?
I know you hate butter .
Any@@ thing ?
Dam@@ on fu@@ cking e@@ ats . And he keeps it in .
When you were a .. just a little baby ,
I can &apos;t wait till we get that money .
American t@@ ooth@@ paste .
Why are you giving it to her ?
Well , you don &apos;t want me to have it .
I have no poker face .
Carol@@ ine , I &apos;m warning you .
Even if I be@@ g you , don &apos;t tell me .
Your dad wrote and directed this thing too ?
Y@@ ik@@ es , it says here
We &apos;re seeing an under@@ study ?
Steel bars
Well , we won &apos;t keep you prison@@ er much longer .
Second half ? That was three hours !
Especially the escape attempt scene .
He sure is a big man on his blog ,
All right , well , here you go .
I &apos;m real sorry to hear about you and Max .
Why does every single person keep telling me
Here . Let me do that .
You only have to work on Wall Street , ok@@ ay ?
D@@ ad@@ dy , did you and Max talk about this ?
You could still be friends with Max .

It &apos;s the hard@@ est one .
But you &apos;re seeing other people , obviously .
I &apos;m so sorry . That was way too personal .
I &apos;m just not used to it .
Well , then , come work here .
We &apos;ll isol@@ ate the vessels ,
I don &apos;t know if you can , M@@ er .
Nice work , you guys .
Do we need both ?

I &apos;ve been stuck in this bed ,
Re@@ ady to get back to my feet and ...
I lost myself there for a while . K@@ ep@@ ner .
There won &apos;t be enough functioning liver to support this k@@ id .
You print one dam@@ n for@@ k , and now you think
And I need this conversation to be over !
Is that how the decision &apos;s made ?
What ?
No , no , between you and me .
Listen , the whole fu@@ cking game has changed .
Fu@@ ck that ! I fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; love this place .
What are you gon@@ na do with the rest of that ?
No , bud@@ dy , you got to drink every drop of that . You know why ?
It &apos;s true . Go on . Put it away .
So ...
Oh , I remember . Some@@ thing did happen .
Tim@@ my . He &apos;s the k@@ id who &apos;s always trying to trip me .
So I pun@@ ched him in the face .
Jim@@ my .
Is that why you think you got in trouble ?
You got to learn from these things , right ?

Jim@@ my ?
No , that &apos;s absolutely what I should be t@@ ell@@ in &apos; him , babe .
it &apos;s not what you do , it &apos;s when and where you do it ,
Yes , I follow .
That &apos;s exactly right .
it didn &apos;t happen .
Good afternoon , Officer Fl@@ yn@@ n .
Do your fu@@ cking job !
I &apos;m sure the officer didn &apos;t stop us by accident .
In fact , I am .
Sa@@ ys he doesn &apos;t like finding his boys
Listen , mo@@ ther@@ fu@@ cker ,
Close the fu@@ cking door .
It &apos;s a sad day when a native son takes up with his op@@ pres@@ sor .
Pen@@ alty &apos;s death .
Take it easy , will you ?
A fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; pri@@ ck .
Swe@@ ar to God , I &apos;m gon@@ na fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; kill him .
Take it easy , will you ?
I couldn &apos;t have said it any better .
And no one &apos;s gon@@ na raise an ey@@ eb@@ row
you can &apos;t kill any@@ body , Jim@@ my .
No , I didn &apos;t know .
We fu@@ ck@@ in &apos; buried rats , especially our own .
I knew he had his sources .
But obviously , he had a plan .
H@@ ey , Steve . H@@ ang on a minute .
Can I trust you , St@@ ev@@ ie ?
Good .
What can I tell you , Bil@@ ly boy ?
Would you say Winter Hill was thri@@ ving ?
Which meant we had to pay off a lot of people ,
We were thro@@ wing money around like crazy .
Ye@@ ah , &quot; fu@@ ck me &quot; and fu@@ ck you is right .
Jesus , John .
In five fu@@ cking years of
Fu@@ ck that . This , on the other hand
Jim@@ my always had a plan .
Now , that was a smart play ...

Situation down there was changing , and not for the better .
Thank you , Alan .
John Cal@@ la@@ han has us po@@ ised for great success .
Well , they fu@@ cking love it , St@@ ev@@ ie .
But who knows for how much longer with Whe@@ el@@ er moving in ?
But at least we still got this .
All right .

This is why I never married .
You &apos;re as beautiful as the day I lost you .
U@@ h , let me see .
Please , ladies first .
Ok@@ ay , I love you again .
You can still jump .
Check every tra@@ p .

I got it .
Will stop me on my ... journey
And love me for etern@@ ity
That &apos;s your mother ? !
The Alpha !
Att@@ abo@@ y !
You cannot take our dra@@ g@@ ons !
Then it &apos;s a good thing I brought a chall@@ enger .
That is a class ten ! Class ten !
No dragon can res@@ ist the Alpha &apos;s command
Wit@@ ness true strength .
In the face of it ,
But , please , O great dragon master ,
It wasn &apos;t your fault , bu@@ d .
Why do you ask ?
Oh , my God , that &apos;s so generous !
Well , our friend Ra@@ i moved into my old room ,
Be@@ ver@@ ly , you know l hold you in high est@@ e@@ em .
Very well , but , u@@ h , if you don &apos;t mind ,
You &apos;ve recently moved in with Dr. F@@ ow@@ ler , yes ?
Cle@@ arly , your old room represents an escape hat@@ ch ,
And don &apos;t start thinking about it now !
She said def@@ en@@ sively .
This is about Ra@@ i@@ esh moving in with Leon@@ ard and Penn@@ y .
They &apos;ve found a need to take yet another ro@@ omm@@ ate .
I had no idea
That is the word on the street , dear .
I haven &apos;t been here one day , I &apos;m already causing problems .
That &apos;d make a nice need@@ le@@ point pil@@ low .
That &apos;ll do it .
Look , could you please put your dog on a le@@ ash ?
Well , then at least hold her still
Thank you . I appreciate that .
What are you talking about ? We &apos;re fine .
It used to be me .
Any@@ way , I &apos;m sorry for everything .
We don &apos;t have mar@@ ital problems !
Look , just because we took our friend in does not mean
Shel@@ don mentioned you tried to get your brother
Do you agree with that ?
Are you kid@@ ding me ?
Now you &apos;re taking her side ?
That &apos;s for your par@@ ade of ro@@ omm@@ ates to do .
It &apos;s me ! It &apos;s just me !
Not on my watch !
You can hit him with the bat , but it &apos;s fine .
I &apos;m sorry , guys .
I just wanted to go some@@ place where I wasn &apos;t causing problems .
India .
Don &apos;t do that . We &apos;ll make up the couch for you
It &apos;s not that unusual .
Ros@@ e@@ ola , sh@@ ing@@ les , lu@@ pus .

Come on .
Sh@@ ep@@ herd , what are you doing ?
A tan@@ ker didn &apos;t b@@ low .
Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t you get the mem@@ o ?
Ye@@ ah , I need you to start using other intern@@ s .
Ros@@ s , are you feeling poor@@ ly rounded ?
See ? He &apos;s very rounded .
A tan@@ ker didn &apos;t b@@ low .
Oh , speaking of which , when can I have my gen@@ ome m@@ apped ?
It can happen in m@@ ales .
It &apos;s just , now I &apos;m thinking about your bre@@ asts .
The tan@@ ker did not b@@ low .
B.@@ P. 110 over 70 . Pul@@ se 95 .
Does my husband have E@@ than ?
Rach@@ el !
He was walking around at the scene .
Are my mo@@ m and dad dead ?
You &apos;ll see them soon . I got you . Ok@@ ay ?
Ok@@ ay , let &apos;s go .

As soon as we get you signed out ,
Well , I hope your son feels better .
I want to step outside for a smoke .

K@@ ep@@ ner , how are we doing ?
From am@@ bul@@ ance arrival ,
Just like it &apos;s supposed to .
The tan@@ ker must have blow@@ n .

We need another ... IV .
U@@ gh . Right front@@ al lo@@ be hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge .
Oh , cool , is it a ep@@ i@@ dur@@ al hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ?
You guys were having a moment or something .
Well , chief H@@ unt says I need to learn bra@@ iny things .
Lu@@ cky . My ro@@ omm@@ ate went last year .
It &apos;s a f@@ ancy people fr@@ at party .
Oh , map my gen@@ om@@ es .
It &apos;s not a spa treatment . It &apos;s science .
No , you &apos;re right .
Exc@@ use me .
The injury extends into the a@@ or@@ tic arch .
I &apos;m just waiting on Russell for a second opinion .
Not really .
I want to see my parents .
Hon@@ ey , we need to go .
You need sleep .
Yes , you are . You &apos;re coming with me . Now come .
How about we set you up in a room ,
No , of course not . I told you , he &apos;s up all night .
It &apos;s just me .
Are you a psych@@ iat@@ rist ?
You think I-@@ I ski@@ p work
He used to wake me up every morning at da@@ wn
U@@ h , find an O.@@ R. that &apos;s available . Ok@@ ay ?
You never miss , do you ?
Cir@@ cus act .
I know this must be so anno@@ ying for you .
Please . Um ...
Ok@@ ay , are you sure that it &apos;s not lu@@ pus ?
What else ?
Ok@@ ay . Um ...
They said it can cause a heart attack .
It would explain the f@@ ever and the r@@ ash .
But then her dad died ,
That people join bow@@ ling le@@ agues ?
waiting for them to see that they were meant to be together ,
Ye@@ ah .
O@@ oh , B@@ ail@@ ey .
I need to know which parent I take after .
C@@ alli@@ e , I asked for an or@@ th@@ o consult ,
I was , but then .. b@@ aked Alaska .
Well , h@@ ey , look at it this way .
And I still need an or@@ th@@ o consult
It was very inspir@@ ing .
car@@ ti@@ lage right now .
Ye@@ ah , and I &apos;m telling you that it &apos;s great .
Finally .
I feel better about not going .
So any idea when the k@@ id &apos;s dad
No , no idea .
That a@@ or@@ tic repair took a lot longer than I thought .
in 29 minutes .
I could sleep in the shower .
Sh@@ oot .
Where &apos;s Charlie ?
He saved us , you fu@@ cking as@@ sh@@ ole .
You know , in the divor@@ ce petition .
Think I would have loved them .
And then Ly@@ dia .
She was the k@@ indest person I ever met .
Because , in the end , there are only two types of people .
God , you sound like my father .
Tar@@ get heading north .
He &apos;s mobile . Roger that .
May I bor@@ row this ? Thank you .
Alpha 1 now on Fo@@ x@@ tro@@ t . I &apos;m in pursu@@ it .
The ank@@ le &apos;s sh@@ atter@@ ed . You &apos;ll need to carry me .
Sorry . Get in .
Soon as I &apos;ve printed your ticket .
Why , what happened to your ank@@ le ?
Hello .
I need your help .
If you don &apos;t , I could be dead by the end of the day .
L@@ ed@@ ford activated someone called Ch@@ il-@@ something .
Chil@@ cot@@ t ? Oh , Jesus , he &apos;s a psych@@ op@@ ath .
Jo@@ die , I need you to do something for me .
If I can find him , it will clear my name .
I &apos;ll try .
No , it says 2016 .
In that case , I got two zer@@ oes for free , so who &apos;s the idi@@ ot ?
There are people looking for me .
It &apos;s not about the ball , l@@ ads .
They &apos;re from London .
Of course .
It &apos;s all right to be sad .
It &apos;s imperative no one know that I &apos;m here .
Ex@@ ac@@ tly . All right .
It &apos;s just this way , past the train station .
In you go .
If we have b@@ unk beds , can I have the top ?
Go and have a pe@@ e now before the other passengers do .
See those blo@@ kes out there ?
How d@@ are those tw@@ ats show up here ?
No school ! Come on .
Let &apos;s go , l@@ ads .
Exc@@ use me , si@@ r . I think you dropped something .
You &apos;re in Gri@@ m@@ s@@ by now , you g@@ it !

That pel@@ let was filled with L@@ onom@@ ia c@@ ater@@ pillar tox@@ in .
Ok@@ ay , ok@@ ay .
That &apos;s it .
And now sp@@ it it out .
I thought I &apos;d lost you , brother .
Where ?
No , you don &apos;t .. What are you doing ?
And England to have the ball . Time for one last attack , baby .
Get in there . Rah@@ e@@ em Ster@@ ling &apos;s through .

I have done . Your ali@@ as is Mr. Shel@@ ton .
I have something for you to celebrate :
You &apos;ll like it . Listen ,
Who &apos;s that you were talking to ?
He flies to and from South America
At the end of the game ,
By which time , 96@@ ,000 fans
Well , think about it .
I &apos;m just trying to make the world
&quot; C@@ ure the world . &quot;
Put this in your ear .
Ok@@ ay , I will scan for the chemical signature .
No , it &apos;s not .
We need to stop her before she sets off the virus .
We can &apos;t go around . There &apos;s not enough time .
P@@ itch invasion .
This is important .

It allows my hands to manip@@ ulate this craft
Come on , guys . We got@@ ta go !
We got@@ ta get to Daniel &apos;s building
Come on !
And you know Pow@@ ell .
It &apos;s a big job .
Just to be safe .
We can do this all in-@@ house , hu@@ h ?
I promised Bra@@ d I would call his mo@@ m if anything happened .
No , it &apos;s ok@@ ay . I &apos;ll do it .
He kept a bad@@ ge from the police benefit .
h@@ e-@@ he failed the test to get into the ac@@ ademy five times .
This is a map of the Company &apos;s bas@@ ement , right ?
I assumed it would be a lot more complicated than this .
This is some sort of con@@ den@@ sing unit .
They &apos;re all completely dis@@ similar items .
It just , um ...
Well , I can see that you &apos;re busy ,
Come back ?
What exactly is the plan ?
If he gets a tur@@ tle , well ..
What the hell are you doing here ?
Just keep it down ; keep it down .
We need some help . I &apos;m already
Bel@@ lick &apos;s dead .
Let &apos;s go , Lin@@ c .
He &apos;s in and out of consciousness
Does he have insurance ?
I don &apos;t have the card ,
How long have you been working for them ?
I came in in &apos; 94 .
Always fre@@ el@@ ance .
I like to finish a job and then move on .
Do you always leave your name behind
Well , we &apos;re considering modifications and ..
You know what happens ?
You don &apos;t own it anymore .
Then , somehow you stayed out of trouble .
Look , I can handle this .
I &apos;m just k@@ icking myself .
This thing has gotten way out of hand .
You don &apos;t trust me , Fern@@ ando ?
Because we all want the same thing : S@@ cy@@ lla .
Or would you like me to call the bom@@ b squ@@ ad ?
If that thing b@@ lows while I &apos;m pul@@ ling the pin ,
I &apos;m known for my ste@@ ady hand .
Keep your weight even .
Oh , no , I can &apos;t ... I can &apos;t , I can &apos;t do it .
I got a key .
B@@ aker gave you this ? No .
All right , well , this makes more sense .
they &apos;re micro@@ phones .
This is a line of J@@ Z@@ 33 land mines
It &apos;ll cut the power long enough for you
I found David B@@ aker .
You can do it . You only have
Michael and I figured it out .
But by next spring , she will be a trained Alpha ,
Learn to keep the peace .
But . But ..

You &apos;re not allowed to h@@ ow@@ l with her . She &apos;s an Alpha .
But we can &apos;t , you know , h@@ ow@@ l together .
K@@ id@@ ding .
Friends for life !
Welcome back , Hum@@ ph@@ rey .

So I heard you and Gar@@ th spent some time together .

I &apos;ll tell them you said hi .
Ye@@ ah . You know , it &apos;s alone wol@@ f thing .
So I &apos;ll be a fun@@ -@@ loving l@@ one wol@@ f .
I saw this coming a few years back .
Th@@ ought I was dre@@ aming .
And I needed you .
That tr@@ umps what you need . It &apos;s too late , bud@@ dy .
You know what I need ? I need a s@@ have .
Even dis@@ assembled , I wanted to please him .
where would we go once his plan was complete ?
&quot; To the Garden . &quot;
When Th@@ an@@ os sn@@ apped his fingers ...
No one &apos;s ever seen anything like it .
on this planet .
The qu@@ antum realm is like its own micro@@ scop@@ ic universe .
Hope . She &apos;s my , um .
She was supposed to pull me out .
Sorry , bud@@ dy , we got a problem .
Well , what are we gon@@ na do now ?
I just got hit in the head with the H@@ ul@@ k .
This was our shot .
It was six stones or nothing .
You &apos;re repe@@ ating yourself . You &apos;re repe@@ ating yourself .
No . You never wanted a time hei@@ st .
I dropped the ball .
Is that what I did ?
There &apos;s no do-@@ over@@ s .
Each .
by@@ e-@@ b@@ ye , you &apos;re not going home .
then no one else is going home , either .
I said bring them in .
Oh , for the love of ..
It &apos;s not light@@ ning stri@@ kes we &apos;re looking at .
That is a long-@@ hor@@ ned be@@ et@@ le .
Hair . Maybe he got a piece of his att@@ acker .
Ye@@ ah , ok@@ ay .
Ye@@ ah , same thing over here .
Stop , please stop !
Do you see these ab@@ ra@@ sions and cuts here in the chest ?
The place was completely tr@@ ashed .
I was the one who wanted to get married at the convention .
All of our friends were going to be here , anyway .
Let &apos;s go back to
V@@ amp@@ ires , and@@ . unfortunately wer@@ ew@@ ol@@ ves .
May I see your hand , please ?
We found the same sc@@ ar
And .. no returns .
How many of these have you sold ?
Um , out of cur@@ i@@ osity ...
Re@@ ally none of your business .
It &apos;s a terrible thing to wake up to every day .
Your wol@@ f &apos;s in the system .
H@@ mm , how original .
Wol@@ ves don &apos;t normally attack humans .
Who &apos;s the owner ?
Ye@@ ah , someone d@@ rank Michael Wilson &apos;s blood
No . It did not come back to Kurt Francis .
If we accept the myth@@ ology , wer@@ ew@@ ol@@ ves don &apos;t drink blood ,
Don &apos;t they hate each other ?
I understand why the wer@@ ew@@ ol@@ ves
Maybe Michael lost faith .
You wanted her all to yourself , didn &apos;t you ?
The yellow contact lens
But without the murder weapon , we can &apos;t prove
The clothes should prove it .
You know , there should be a lot more blood than this .
Well , at the least , they were there .
He was hit with an ax@@ e at least 18 times ,
Or another v@@ amp@@ ire .
There &apos;s just one draw@@ back ..
What did you find , David ?
We didn &apos;t find any of this stuff at the crime scene .
We know that Michael was running from his att@@ ack@@ ers .
Where did it begin ?
Your beloved used to be a wer@@ ew@@ ol@@ f .
Sa@@ id he knew we were dest@@ ined to be together .
Love built on a lie isn &apos;t love .
He wasn &apos;t one of us .
Did it ?
That was really intense .
Oh , good . You &apos;re here . I need your assistance .
What happened ?
Be@@ en there .
A@@ my &apos;s mad at me , and I &apos;m not clear why .
Yes .
What &apos;d you say to her ?
And that made her angry ?
It was . I asked her
I &apos;m gon@@ na gu@@ ess that your main concern is the time commitment
If I &apos;m in , I &apos;m in for the whole run ,
I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have asked so many questions .
Ye@@ ah , maybe it &apos;s good you got US talking about this stuff .
even when I &apos;m causing problems , I make the world a better place .
U@@ h , Shel@@ don , I think we &apos;re good for now .
So does this mean you &apos;ll finally pick a wedding date ?
Why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date ?
A ceremony isn &apos;t gon@@ na change anything .
It &apos;s his wh@@ ining , isn &apos;t it ?
Look , all she &apos;s saying is we are in love
Ye@@ ah , but we &apos;ll be old and gross together .
Tow@@ ards the end , it was like watching cheese m@@ elt .
Are you saying you want to get married ?
I &apos;m in . Let &apos;s do it .
I &apos;m really happy for the two of you .
Ber@@ nie , Stu@@ art just pulled up .
Show no weak@@ ness .
Good luck .
Never should have told you my middle name .
H@@ ey , you got a minute ?
I felt bad for finishing your y@@ og@@ urt , so I bought more .
C@@ run@@ ch Ber@@ ries .
I want you all to realize that the only thing
And you can feel it when you go into a room ,
And ...
How many do you have ?
I want you to write again .
I &apos;m having dinner with my husband ton@@ ight .
It &apos;s for you .
That means she moved him to a safe house .
Bal@@ der &apos;s program had a fre@@ ak encryption .
That means these guys are going after him next .
She doesn &apos;t have the mon@@ op@@ oly on gu@@ ilt .
What makes you think I &apos;m not ?
Ye@@ ah ?
He has a tat@@ too like yours .
No , worse .
That guy , he &apos;s part of this group .
There were two key stories
I think you are sc@@ ared
Lis@@ bet@@ h . I haven &apos;t heard of the spi@@ ders .
It &apos;s the answer to &quot; the snow comes early this year . &quot;
Father said he made his program based on how I think .
No , I don &apos;t .
Pass@@ enger need@@ ham , please proceed to gate 45 immediately .
North end of the terminal . Person@@ n@@ el-@@ only door .

What I have is a responsibility to my country .
I understand how to open that door .
Free@@ ze ! Who@@ a , wh@@ oa , wh@@ oa !
Please get her a glass of water .
Would you please talk some sense into him ?
I made these just for him .
It will not kill him ,
There &apos;s a lot of pressure .
Well , then you better find a s@@ itter .
Y@@ ep . I got a hot date .
Right away .
No , it &apos;s not a mig@@ ra@@ ine .
I have been off of
Sir , you &apos;re at Seattle Grace Mer@@ cy West Hospital .
No one was hurt , but we need to get you examined .
I must have fallen as@@ le@@ ep at the wheel for a second .
