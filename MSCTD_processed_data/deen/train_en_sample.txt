Is this a met@@ aph@@ ysi@@ cal question ?
I d@@ well on logic .
Death , gri@@ ev@@ ing , mo@@ ur@@ ning
I was given a small chest containing the Wat@@ son stories ,
A few months ago , my brother My@@ cro@@ ft died .
It &apos;s strange to see a sem@@ b@@ lance of one &apos;s self 40 feet high
His club , the Di@@ o@@ genes ,
The story was familiar ,
Dear man , you should fear for your life .
Mur@@ der , Mr. Kel@@ mo@@ t . Mur@@ der .
and played
With what means have T ?
All I knew for certain was that the case was my last
I had a 6@@ re@@ at unc@@ le who lived to be 102
I &apos;m 93 .
He must have decided to take it sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously .
C@@ ould have done .
Should be in hospital . That or one of them places .
Is that clear
It &apos;s from Mr. U@@ me@@ z@@ aki .
He &apos;ll get better !
And why do you think that is ?
If you read their letters , you &apos;d want to help .
If you read their letters , you &apos;d want to help .
Oh . I &apos;ll never go back to Japan .
And why do you think that is ?
If you read their letters , you &apos;d want to help .
Perhaps Mr. U@@ me@@ z@@ aki &apos;s asking you to go back to Japan .
Why not ?
Do it
M@@ um , wait .
Let &apos;s not bo@@ ther Mr. Hol@@ mes with any f@@ oo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness .
You &apos;ve been away most of the day .
There is no sh@@ ame in what I do !
They made you an offer , you accepted
Your dad h@@ ated what he did for a living .
There is no sh@@ ame in what I do !
And you wish you had it better !
Don &apos;t say everything you think .
Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t know it was a desk until I opened it .
Cou@@ ldn &apos;t have . The one in the corner .
Di@@ d@@ n &apos;t know it was a desk until I opened it .
Oh , that &apos;s not my desk , it &apos;s John &apos;s .
I know you say Dr. Wat@@ son didn &apos;t always get things right ,

Yes , but in Wat@@ son &apos;s story , he does have the ar@@ mon@@ ica in it .
I chose ex@@ ile for my punishment , but what was it for ?
Lo@@ gic is rare .
If you can &apos;t remember , then why couldn &apos;t the case have been a success
And if I &apos;d brought it to a successful conclusion ,
My husband could never succeed at dec@@ eption
The man who took away the music you loved ,
And then I witness@@ ed your actions .
To keep you from this appointment you seem so e@@ ager to make .
Even before I gli@@ mp@@ sed you today ,
The second was un@@ avo@@ id@@ able , and all the more dam@@ ning .
Was that the second error
We must place bl@@ ame on your husband for the first .

but since you love her so much , I &apos;m gon@@ na keep looking .
I have looked from one end of town to the other ,
Why don &apos;t I go look ?
It &apos;s just that I have so many questions , and ...
S@@ ure .
And we &apos;d keep this from your mo@@ m ?
&quot; How &apos;s it go@@ in &quot; ?
I didn &apos;t set that fire .

1959 , when I was 18 .
It had gotten a little difficult with the police on one side
It wasn &apos;t long after that
It wasn &apos;t long after that
We both attended the University of Washington .
And it was like ,
The ban on inter@@ racial marriage was lifted in 1968 .
And then when we were both done with our classes ,
In the rest of the country there were no inter@@ racial mar@@ ri@@ ages .
But the fact is , it wasn &apos;t about mass .
You got the job on The Green Hor@@ net ,
That didn &apos;t mean the ban lifted in people &apos;s hearts .
But , then again ,
He would just put it down no matter how big you were .
You got the job on The Green Hor@@ net ,
And it &apos;s a h@@ eck of a name , man .
A lot of st@@ unt guys didn &apos;t know
We could care less about Te@@ en Hor@@ net .
You do the old John Wa@@ yne ,
Th@@ ats something I can really
When I did The Green Hor@@ net , I was not being myself
By the way , I did a really terrible job in that , I have to say .
He really did read
Any book I &apos;d pick up , there were not@@ ations about
what was functional , what was no good !
As an actor , as a mar@@ tial artist , as a human being ,
what was functional , what was no good !
It can be taught .
Do you understand ?
J@@ K@@ D in 1970 will be different . &quot;

Second to none .
There &apos;s no debate .
You name it , man , we use it .
I do think ther &apos;s a cor@@ relation there ,
And he was out , like ,
If D@@ ana White says Bruce Lee is the father of mixed mar@@ tial arts ,
If D@@ ana White says Bruce Lee is the father of mixed mar@@ tial arts ,
Then had a spin , do a c@@ res@@ cent k@@ ick on me
I &apos;d throw him and fli@@ p him and
If you &apos;re gon@@ na say father of mixed mar@@ tial ...
If you &apos;re gon@@ na say father of mixed mar@@ tial ...
He was so directed and
But Bruce Lee is 100 percent the father of mixed mar@@ tial arts .
It &apos;s really heavy and it says ,
My@@ self , right .
Y@@ our@@ self ?
And did that part , just expressed myself like I say
And did that part , just expressed myself like I say
Was he too ?
I don &apos;t know if you remember them .
Like water .
Put water into a bottle , it becomes the bottle .
He &apos;s from the land . He &apos;s one of the folk .
You put it in a te@@ ap@@ ot , it becomes the te@@ ap@@ ot .
Bruce Lee completely changed
But at the same time as that , he &apos;s never one of the guys .
And this is why it was so
They cho@@ p &apos; em up so much .
But the Western movies really p@@ iss me off .
