safe travels .
famous michael scofield .

i 'm really not following you .
and not falling . right .
seeing lily do so well brought out something in me .
okay , here comes her dismount .
she stuck it !
my sweater , which you shouldn 't even be wearing !
short layover in salt lake .
oh , phil , you must have known this was gonna happen .
it 's better that you find out who they are now

what a huge ask !
yeah , i know . it 's the way we look at people
hey , good luck on your balance beam routine , sweetie .
i 'll never beat lily .
and your daughter 's a genius . i am such a fan . such a fan .

you are welcome .
i was downloading all the charts you asked for ,
well , bailey pushed all her patients onto me ,
i mean , is that so terrible , huh ?
i mean , not that she asked me .
well , i suppose i could ask her if she minds if i join ..
she should want me there .
no , but she 's got it all handled .
it 's .. it 's foolhardy
good talk . thanks , kepner .
can you do a minimally invasive ..
we 'll have to use an anterior approach through the chest .
one , two , three .
and then today , i ... it 's like i 'm invisible .
maybe the kiss meant nothing and we 're friends .
wait . no , i 'm not saying that you and i ...
i can 't help you .
go talk to shepherd .
you know what ? you 're right . you 're right .
i should just go right up to her and be direct .
oh , i need to go . hang in there , kepner .
uh , which approach are you going to use ?
it 's not ideal , but ..
who am i listening to ?
you open her neck , she 's gonna bleed out in seconds .
do not open her neck , please .
uh ... that 's my bad .
i know . i can see it through those shorts .
last stop on the cupcake train .
and this is max ,

can you take this ?
max , what did you do ?
and now i 'm about to run .

you need to ask the chief factor about that .
what good is one cow to anyone ?
chief factor wants milk in his tea .
like a proper lady .
god would have put cows here if it was .
well , look who 's here .
didn 't it , william ?
willy , better do something ,
make some proper money , eh ?
thought i might find you here sooner or later .
i was lucky .
well , here i am ,
oh , they mostly went south , some north .
not yet .
and , uh , where are you staying in the meantime ?
i think we should test the waters .
i 've heard a fortune is made on this .
so is anything worth doing .
five twists , six twists half off .
fresh oily cakes .
it 's out of season , i believe .
i-i would pay you handsomely
if blueberry is available , i 'm sure i can make one .
the hotels in saint francisco are grand .
a room with a bed , that 's all ,
he 'll taste his milk in there eventually .
he 'd be suspicious .
some people can 't imagine being stolen from .
let 's hope he 's one of those .
that sounds like quite a situation indeed ,
for the men , broad shoulders and puffed sleeves ,
history moves so quickly in paris .
it never reaches here at all .

she 's a very fine cow .
third is assorted pheromones . tread lightly .

maybe , but i 'm guessing it 'll cost you about $ 500 an hour to try .
whatever .
oh , howard 's losing it .
" i 'm at the bottom of a black hole " staring into the abyss .
you think that 'd help ?
all right , where are these amazing shrimp ?
seriously , you think this is the size of a baby 's arm ?
okay , i 'm going back to the room .
hi , there . howard wolowitz .
i don 't think the manager 's coming tonight , so here .

and given its dimensions ,
and when you flash it to the police ,
i heard the phone . who died ?
oh , jay , i 'm so sorry .
jay , do you have some time today ?
just get whatever you want .
what i want is a husband

jay will take you .
i can 't believe this .
with a heated pool .

i like the trolley problem .
should you do it ?
but what if the situation was slightly different ?
do you push him in front of it ?
gamma ray burst , pandemic , erupting super volcano ,
but is it biological ? geological ? thermal nuclear ? meteorological ?
ready ? set .
sorry , what are we doing in prambanan ?
cake shelter here in this reinforced bunker .
the temperature of an impact point is ten million degrees
i stipulate the existance of 1,000 bunkers around the world
well , you have to .
it 's the sort of pseudo-science
which means , a commitment to reason no matter how much it hurts .
when the hot particles of nuclear fallout
well , i suppose i 'm in .
one in the history of this department .
bribery is not my very favorite form of negotiation .
let 's say if you leave someone else pays .

i stipulated i was the wild card , wich you get in any random sampling
don 't worry about it you 'll do better in the next iteration .
mont bromo .
but we still have a bunker and we still have an apocalypse .
so how would it be any different this time ?
i 'm an organic farmer. who is gay
that still doesn 't answer my question . i 'm a farmer , i 'm gay .
i still have the right equipment so , whoever wants to vote for me ?
that 's a puzzler , do you risk a slot on a doctor
next

more like the toilet . but the potential 's there .. we could make it work .
he said there 's something nasty going around , and you should take one , too .
az-pak ? i 'm not sick , though .
oh , honey ? i need you to sign some papers for me .
it 's boring stuff from the accountant . servicecircuit again .

i will wind up in gen pop . turn around .
i have soft hands and a small mouth . i will be the bottom !
i don 't want to make license plates ! you won 't go to jail .
anyway , speaking of changes ...

we thought you might say that . then carly explained

yeah , good luck , with that gimp leg of yours .
yeah . and i 'm tired , and i 'm starving .

i mean , i 'm hurting here . i 'm in pain .
basson . you hear that ?
it 's a union gig , pension and health . so ...
lots of time in the eyepiece .
so , i take it he didn 't give you my resume ?
this is called a digital file .
kind of wish your website could do the same for you , but i can help .
i 'm a big fan . you know , possibly your biggest .
you know what it says ?
i don 't need fixing .
you binge watch breaking bad , again ?
what i choose to do with my cranium is none of your business .
this is snake , right , not rat ?
it 's van wyk .
mr. gummer really isn 't in the monster business , anymore .
give us a minute , will you ?
i 'm working this dude for some paper .
cash . listen .
request denied . i work alone .

family of werewolves in peru we heard about .
i don 't suppose it would make any difference
three .
how quickly can you roll your tents ?
burt gummer . in africa .
this doesn 't look like any ass blaster i 've ever seen .
come again ?
mr. bravers , are you drunk ?
mr. gummer ?
the owner 's been kind enough to let us base our operations there .
about that .
i should have warned you about the three-day weapons quarantine .
don 't worry about it . i 've procured us some weapons .
there , there it is , there , there .
yeah ?
every morning in africa , a gazelle wakes up .
he gets killed .
and he knows he 's gotta outrun the slowest gazelle ,
hey , if you need my help , call me on the horn .
oh , right , the monster-hunters , right ?
there .
wow .
what 's this ?
a bsa .303 and a 30-06 ?
and a ...
are you serious ? we might as well use a spit straw .
okay , well , sounds delicious .
at ease , mr. welker .
um .. i 've arranged some refreshments for you back at the lodge .
it 's nandi .
let 's rest up , mr. gummer . start fresh in the morning , yes ?
if you 've got graboids , no one is safe .
well , hello .
you did it .
be nice to stay out here in the bush , with you .
yes .
you know , thaba , i 'm really not sure about these guys .
i don 't like the way he 's looking at my nandi .
yeah , well , she could be .
a guy can dream , right ?
well , here 's some intel for you , doc .
you need to evacuate everyone , asap .
all right , load every gun . we 're going after them .
i 'll hitch the lion cage .
hey , gummy bears , wait up .
wait up .
you copy ?
i don 't have the time to posture for your camera !
what 's a veterinarian doing with a machine gun ?
ass blasters don 't fly , they glide .
they fart to take off ? that 's funny .
what the hell you doing here ?
you drove straight into a kill zone , you moron .
this might get a bit bumpy .
hang on , burt !
i think i 'll walk the rest of the way .
damn you , travis !
that 's it .
i don 't know . you got trust issues , man .
you got a signal on that phone , yet ?
trade ?
three , two , one .
i 'll handle it from here .
this is retarded .
mr. bravers , burt gummer here . i 'm in a bit of pickle .
but we are not out of ammo .
the bag is full , and it 's ready to blow .
oh , my god . you 're right .
that 'll scramble a few eggs .
now , how do we get to the chopper without gettin ' eaten alive ?
if we run with them , we can get lost in their seismic signatures .
" when the sun rises in africa , you better be running .
no . impossible .
i don 't believe it . there 's no way you 're my offspring .
what , do you think you 're better than me ?
yeah , look at me .
mom !
travis , look ! amahle , behind you !
off the ground and on the truck !
let 's go .
it 's okay . wait right there .
it 's gonna be okay , honey .
let me get a shot on it .
what does she have in that basket ?
we can build one on a much larger scale .
the lightning .
you can set your watch to the lightning , right ?
let 's hope the bride doesn 't get cold feet .
can you keep her busy ?
if we 're lucky , she 'll follow your seismic signature .
your signal ?
lynette knew she 'd cherish the memory of that moment
mrs. mccluskey , why are you faking my flower pot ?
your boys stole it off my porch .
i bought this in costa rica on my last cruise . you see ?
what ? nothing more to say ? cat got your tongue ?
yes , most mothers will tell you
while some purchased romantic cards ..
and some made dinner reservations at fancy restaurants ..
this flurry of activity was lost
a secret that was positively heartbreaking .
yeah .
i mean , little boys don 't just kill their baby sisters
so this is it .
think of the guilt that she must have lived with .
i wish i could . i still feel like something 's not right .
rex and i are hosting a dinner party for ten next week .
so , you and rex are a couple again ?
there 's just something so civilized and elegant about them ,
well , it won 't be easy at first .
well , as long as you have a plan .
but .. there 's something he 's still not telling me .
i think it has something to do with why he had the affair .
but you know they apologized for that .
that 's the coward 's way out .
you know what ? this has been fun . but now ...
toys all over the yard , bikes out in the street .
get out of my house !
this just reeks of unresolved childhood trauma .
bree , this is a preference .
for god 's sake . you promised to be supportive .
you see , i dreamed of
a high powered career , a handsome husband ,
because now i know what i 'm capable of .
i 'm never really down , yao lin .
pretty lame , huh ?
well , i could see why you would be .
i couldn 't let myself ruin your valentine 's day .
about not wanting kids .
no , susan .
if that means not being a dad ..
you know that , right ?
what about you , lynette ? do you have anything to say ?
suit yourself .
go ahead .
who are you ?
my name 's lilly .
i was with some people and then the wind came
he was running from the wind . was he with you ?
have you told sira ?
sira 's going to wish for his mother to come back
i don 't know .
it 's ok .
i hope both your wishes come true .
where are the guys ?
oh , i get it .
don 't worry , i can act surprised .
tonight , you belong to me .
i am now that you 're back .
great . just keep in mind
me , too . but we 'll see him tomorrow .
i was excited to see the look on his face
i know .
i have a higher than normal body density .
all right , let 's keep it simple .
oh , that 's not fair either .
here 's your mail , sir .
yeah .
thanks very much .
thank you ...
dan , what are you doing ? you can 't talk to those guys !
okay , this is your first day . we are the mailroom guys .
and ideally , not even seen , okay ?
no , i think you 're just scared to talk to them .
i talk to these people all the ...
it could be a fun way in ..
you do have boat experience , don 't you ?
okay , good ...
you have to be at sea for three weeks , completely off the grid .
good , because i thought ..
so , what do you say ?
so , the bermuda triangle , huh ?
it is . your contact 's been arranged ..
yeah .
okay , precious cargo ! no , no , no !
all you chickens , get out of the road , man !
i mean , are you sure this is safe ?
it makes for good stories ...
no signal , but i got 12 messages .
hey , gulliver . it 's me . it 's darcy .
out of frommer 's . because it does ! call me as soon as you get this .
he 's checking his voicemail , general edward .
what 's voicemail ?
wait ! no , i haven 't ..
isn 't that just the most fantastical news you 've ever received in your life ?
i can 't tell you how happy i am ..
why do you look so forlorn , noble protector ?
i know . crazy weird .
i 'm more worried about the one you showed .
what are you talking about ?
" walt 's dead . " you looked like the joker .
you did . it 's like a weird coping mechanism .
i don 't know what you thought you saw , phil ,
do you think ?
death is a profound thing to deal with at any age .
some people lock up their feelings .
reach out for comfort ,
gloria , i was driving by
no problem .
mm . good thing that you saw this paper
i 'm just thinking out loud here .
would it be okay then ?
you know , it would be good for manny to have a little bit of fun .
mind ? the plan depended on him .
of course not , mom ,
well , i will have you know that merle stonewall tucker
my dad likes him just fine . come on .
mitch .
i gotta cancel tonight .
what are you doing ? i just said i can 't come .
my dad wants to know red or white ?
red . and i 'm sorry .
not jay . the guy rubs me the wrong way .
okay . well , you know what ?
okay , you have to make an effort .
now give me the growl that means " okay . "
his lawyer said she wouldn 't even honor his last request
phil , do we really have to go through this again ?
no , it 's just sad .
he said i could take one thing after he died .
i would 've taken that phone with the big buttons .
no . i just wanted a tv in my room .
what do you mean ?
we could , uh , we could take one of his flowers
you sad ? angry ?
you know you can talk to me .
always has .
oh , you didn 't need to , dad .
oh , merle , thank you so much .
oh , this is so sweet .
don 't .
i know . i know . you gotta do homework .
sorry , sweetie . machine 's broken .
oh , it could be before you get home .
some people repress their feelings
it doesn 't go in the den .
i can see it from my room .
if the tv was on , i knew he was up ,
yeah .
yeah , it still feels just , you know , a little wobbly .
okay , it 's " go " time .
it 's okay . it 's just a cramp .
please , no . he 's already made me eat
is this about walt dying ?
i don 't want to be that kind of dad .
who 's eugene cernan ?
when he was leaving the moon , he reached down
i was talking her into it , okay ?
um , she 's 2 . at a certain point ,
so you pick her up and you yank her tights on her .
if you just made it clear in the first place
it 's about new hospital procedures ,
don 't you guys get what 's going on ?
why bother teaching us the new protocols
is it ?
nurses are stockpiling .
your average time between surgeries
thank you , everyone .
we won 't have any patients .
oh , he says he 's not gonna do anything about it
and he can 't be a trauma surgeon without an e.r .
i 'm kind of depending on your rent check .
the e.r. is not going to close .
where is derek ?
it 's gonna work , right ?
and we 'll have enough saved to keep the e.r. alive .
oh , they 're gonna be pissed about everything ,
uh , no , not yet .
wh-wh-wh , is that bad ?
oh , no . did i just kill our proposal ?
go door to door , which is better anyway .
oh . no offense , sir .
to that end , i have brought in dr. darrell nesbaum
when did you become such a kiss-ass ?
i 'll learn to rope cattle if it means keeping my job .
can they ?
of course .
now i have just one question before we begin .
no , she had to leave for work .
you guys , stop .
you 'd be angry , too .
like a badger .
if she doesn 't move her hips , we 're looking at clots ,
oh . look who i 'm talking to .
it 's an order .
dr. hunt , i sent contractors to measure the e.r. space .
i know . that 's why we 're talking .
uh , dr. hunt ,
while we are treating patients ,
i was hoping that you would cooperate .
well ...
sorry . i get a little excited about statistics .
not everybody .
perfect . oh , damn it .
you 're gonna have to start without me .
talk from your heart ,
and there you have it .
after today , something tells me you will , too .
dr. nesbaum .
so if it 's all the same to you , i 'll stick to that .
it 's quick , clean , efficient .
listen to old man webber ,
got it .
hang two units of o-neg as soon as possible .
um , rich . rich campion .
is he on any medications ?
look , is he going to be okay ?
no breath sounds on the right . someone set up a chest tube .
okay . what 's it say ? what 's he allergic to ?
what is he allergic to ?
he 's a jehovah 's witness . we can 't give him blood .
yeah , we have no choice .
oh , we could also be arrested for assault and battery .
i 'm not joking .
we do bloodless surgeries here all the time .
i 'm on it .
here it is .
where is my gel foam and thrombin ?
we need a whole bunch more .
right away , doctor .
can i have a headlamp , please ?
well , i would if we could find out
thank you .
oh , sorry . meant to just say " gauze . "
chief , you know this is all about
dr. avery
if you don 't actually work in one . that 's all i 'm saying .
until today .
i can repair this post-op .
thank you ...
best of luck .
sorry about that .
it 's easier if there 's a bad guy .
i know .
but i also know that without me ,
i 've saved a dozen before just like this one ,
we will discharge you , you will go home ,
why do you care ?
wouldn 't it suck if you didn 't help me ?
no matter how much you care ,
because everything is totally out of your control .
couldn 't have done it better myself .
yes , indeed .
we don 't have a lot of time , but i 'll see what i can do .
hey , hey . tim .
man , he 's cute .
yeah , zola 's at that age
why aren 't you in your skills lab ?
wouldn 't stop kicking , actually .
maybe i should kick my intern .
that 's possible .
he 's not stupid , you know , the eyeball ?
and a zoom lens .
we are giving him everything we have ,
you never administer anything to a patient without my orders .
you know nothing .
the future , kids ,
how 's the research coming ?
not gonna happen .
your team can watch the ted talks online .
the real conf
everyone can benefit from the e.r .
you know what might open my heart to your cause ?
my space is right next to yours .
in fact , you 're 5 feet further from the door .
see , when i use the relaxing incision
the method we learned today is the accepted method
don 't you think every patient
what are their names ? who are their families ?
as long as you can slap a sign on the door that says ,
what matters is ...
obviously , i didn 't mean that . okay ?
everybody 's always been so kind to me .
the neighborhood is about to change .
it 's better to go now , with your memories intact .
you don 't have to worry about that .
i am so sorry . i got hung up .
mr. scully sold ?
i want to have a backup dinner lined up
hey , there 's my favorite lawyer .
you mean free legal advice .
so let 's say hypothetically
she 's not the only illegal i know .
now , let 's say this woman 's daughter is an american citizen .
are we really having this conversation ?
for once it would be nice if you gave me a little good press .
what i bring to the table .
i 'm sorry . i was looking for my contractor boyfriend ,
you look wonderful . hmm .
hang on . yeah , i just gotta grab one thing out of my room .
oh , hey , bree . i heard the door .
hello , richard . are we going to bed or getting up ?
ahh . " wheel of fortune . " getting up .
i hope you don 't mind .
no . no , it 's fine .
okay , i checked the bylaws . we can all relax .
and since he only has one house ...
thank god . let 's call a meeting of the association
not me .
he looks like he could do some damage .
'cause it looks like that 's all i 'm good for .
you okay ?
your friends think everybody on the street is tougher than me .
hey , how about we send lynette over there ?
yeah , that would be great !
listen , everybody . i 've got an idea .
what ?
grace , you want to go to the kitchen for a little bit ?
maybe make yourself a snack .
if anything bad ever happens ,
gaby , immigration 's here .
oh , don 't worry , grace . everything 's gonna be okay .
grace , listen to me . go upstairs to juanita 's room
i 'll be fine .
i might be late tomorrow .
yeah , but it feels like something 's missing .
my father .
oh , it 's okay .
but i 'm really glad it 's just us tonight .
i 'll check on our table .
watson , party of two . i 'm the one who called earlier .
oh , no .
how about an appetizer ?
not jumbo .
well , tracy , not that god needs defending ,
a man with old-fashioned values .
i hope they 'll teach arabic in those schools .
bree , can i talk to you for a sec ?
this plan of yours isn 't working .
you 're a very attractive woman .
hey . you find me attractive ?
would you wanna go out with me ?
ugh . so why the sob-fest ?
great guy from my past .
we only had one ... weekend together , but ..
and the older i get , i keep thinking that ..
and i let him slip away .
there was someone else in the picture .
we never know what 's going to happen .
but i never gave up .
it would work out .
every woman on this street constantly tells me
they do ! gaby says that she wishes carlos
bree says she 's never seen a better dad .
i am the one who 's constantly
see ? you are so nice ,
so if i don 't constantly brag about how great you are ,
who makes me laugh ...
she still cries when she has to
well , we weren 't in a taxi . we were in my car .
ok , that 's a lot of stairs .
you know something ?
thank you for taking care of my baby .
oh , god .
we only have one order of business on the agenda tonight ,
so let 's jump right to the vote .
madame chairwoman ? point of order .
we 'll still vote the same way in two days ,
that 'll be 14 to 1 , too .
how do you figure that ?
what ?
you knew about this ?
couldn 't have done it without him .
how much money did you make from these deals , anyway ?
so that 's why you tried to buy my house .
well , i made it pretty clear how i felt about his offer .
seven houses isn 't enough to win the vote .
so , yeah , i know i can make it here on bloodway
no . not so much .
'course you 'll have to buy a ticket .
thanks ! but in theater we say , " break a leg ! "
welcome to boo york . my name 's elle eedee .
ah , then you must be here for that gala .
that comet must be super important .
oh , my ra , i forgot !
um , your dad will be there . maybe i can just skip .
comet shirts ! show ' em you saw the comet by wearing a t-shirt !
there 's so much to do and see !
ideas ? ideas for what ?
i don 't know what to write about . i just can 't find my music .
um , thank you !

you 're gonna take spectral park west to 14th
upper beast side , born and raised .
i 'm nefera .
after its power was discovered ,
what does any of it have to do with me ?
the money ? the power ? this city ?
once you are promised to seth ptolemy .
he 's .. he 's weird !
uh . i do like power .
oh , well , let 's face it .
you come from two very different worlds .
cleo 's like , " wow , " and i 'm like , " dude . "
she deserves better .
cometpath is unstable ?
luna !
yeah , i know i look silly .
what is that you are doing ?
losing signal . searching again . changing frequency .
what was that ?
iit was like a song in my head . it 's still somewhere inside me .
according to this ,
you are now rocking with the very best rapper from around the way
hey , i 'm pharaoh .
i know . we sounded pretty good together .
come on , let me show you my town .
no , what 's crazy is a famous pop star trying to walk down the street
come on , we have a whole city to explore !
hey , wait up !
now , which do you like better ?
they 're both nice , i guess .
i 've got every album .
they 're my ring tone .
it 's a surprise . you 're gonna love it though !
your friends don 't like music ?
they only like the oldies , you know , from when like tut was young .
just close your eyes and listen .
ah . but you 're not really listening .
rharaoh , i 've found my music .
i 'm too upset about deuce .
but you , you 're singing from your heart . the way i always wanted to .
it 's complicated .
i gave it all up to try and find what you have
ithope iiget see you again .
be true to myself .
thank you , mother .
none of that other stuff
i presume there will be a promise ceremony
the great comet hurtling through space , brimming with magical energy .
our ancestors believed the great comet
why did they send it ?
but what we do know is that any promise made
and when the ceremony is complete , the comet leaves .
the comet crystal . a piece of the great comet itself .
and tonight , the boo york unnatural history museum
the comet crystal !
may i invite you to join me on the roof at midnight ,
i mean , absolutely , madame ... i ... your ptolemy-ness . ma 'am .
right ? they were like romeo and ghouliet .
seth ptolemy ?
oh . you seriously haven 't heard ? everybody 's talking about it .
oh . it 's nothing . pretty silly actually .
you 've got to admit , that would be historic .
and it 's what everybody wants .
i know , crazy , right ? but it would never happen .
cleo , i 'm sorry . i forgot .
luna
don 't worry , you 're going find yourself on bloodway in no time .
we had no idea you and seth .
did ? what do you mean ?
thank you . i have just been assured that
isn 't that right , seth ?
what happened when you and pharaoh left the party ?
it 's a deal .
i always say , " you 're in boo york , you just go for it . "
you 've really given me a lot to think about . thank you .
i 've got to talk to cleo .
her voice ! her musical voice , anyway .
i bet she has the comet crystal !
she could be anywhere in boo york .
and i know where she is .
this is it ! this is what drew me to boo york !
you sang beautiful !
you 're gonna be the next big star on bloodway for sure !
in my next big show , jersey ghouls .
luna mothews . you 're gonna need an agent .
over here !
it looks like luna finally found what she was looking for .
and pharaoh 's voice , too .
i 'm on it .
wait ! deuce !
there aren 't any .
he 's a little shy .
you have to trust yourself first .
right away .
please , follow me . i 'll show you your room .
the treatment ?
it 's called viral gene therapy .
which we can correct using an encoded virus .
i read .
can 't he sleep with us ?
how long have you been a doctor ?
it 's just better if you don 't say anything .
what are you doing ?
put this back in your hand .
who ?
we are thankful for everything that you have given us ...
and especially for placing dr. horn in our paths .
amen .
he 's upset because i yelled at him .
he won 't believe me that i saw someone in the hallway .
in canada . my aunt lives there .
some even thought that orson killed you .
that 's why i left my bird behind and only took cash ,
okay , boys .
hey , wow , look , are those presents for kayla ?
hey , look at that.preston gave you a harmonica . isn 't that cool ?
i 'm out of lipstick . can i borrow yours ?
austin likes the way it tastes .
so , um , where you going ?
but didn 't you tell ian you wouldn 't see him anymore ?
you 're a good friend susan .
it 's ion .
even an ex who doesn 't remember dating you ?
i 'm sorry .
take care of yourself , mike .
you know what might solve something ?
i am trying to open up a restaurant . our life savings is riding on this thing .
you know what ?
she 's part of our family now , and ...
yeah .
exactly .
well , okay , wait , wait , wait , let me explain .
a pretty girl gets flowers .
i work in a flower shop .
hey , mister , help !
gaby ?
i mean , i simply asked her if carlos sent me the flowers ,
the last two years are a blank .
i 'm not sure the jury 's gonna swallow it .
i believe you .
okay , daddy .
that 's why you gotta give her a chance .
okay . i 'll be good .
and you can 't make me .
just when u think bree 's thrown every conceivable theme party
we still don 't know what went down between orson and monique .
just let it go .
we need you to come with us .
why do you think i 'd know anything about her ?
oh , where did you hear that ?
i didn 't know they were gonna come tonight .
my apologies . please , stay .
i don 't believe this .
well , obviously , you weren 't going to .
i told you that in confidence .
yes , lynette scavo had developed a taste for revenge .
we pass by these people every day .
but we just keep walking ...
which we know is a lie .
fine . i 'll talk to her .
i 'm a man of god , bree .
everything 's delicious , gaby .
there was a 2-year wait for a baby .
so we figured , why not ?
and if all goes well ,
what do you really want ?
come on in .
we weren 't a very ... social family .
she 's like the bartender i never had .
i told her not to sleep on her side .
oh . wouldn 't that be nice ?
it-it 's ...
she 's not gonna do it .
it 's ... it 's just the timing of things .
for three months .
is everything okay in here ?
go to your room . go ! both !
of course it 's not mine .
they 're adopting a little girl .
hey , uh , mike 's bringing the car around front .
relax . i wasn 't a match .
come here .
when you were growing up ,
wh-where 's my daughter ? did they move her ?
my own mother !
well , there you go . problem solved .
that is not the point .
and it 's been such a happy one .
yes ?
you go , and i , uh ...
okay .
oh , please .
does that mean you 're not taking preston ?
oh , bree , that looks amazing .
it really feels like old times .
and while i 'm on the topic of embracing people ,
beth young ?
the lady with the bad hair ?
oh , good ! you made it .
ladies , beth 's here !
of course not ! the girls are delighted you 're here .
yeah , so beth 's feeling a little lonely these days .
okay , look , i didn 't wanna bring this up .

because they are the family of the man that i love .
are you okay ? cause i 'm nervous enough as it is .

he could 've done so much better .

it 's a little weird .
i guess , because we made our money in games , it 's part of the initiation .
okay . so , uh , i 'll meet you downstairs . music room .
just .. it is just downstairs . it 's your second door on the right .
i thought i might find you here .
alex didn 't tell us you were brought up in foster homes .
oh . thank you . thanks .
but it was always temporary .
i mean , i 'm sure alex would 've loved living in sin forever .
but he , um , he really understood how important it was for me to ..
and i just don 't wanna let you down .
ou know , it 's almost as if someone 's watching over us .
and this box .
it was a hard life
purchasing exotic antiquities to resell to wealthy americans .
and among mr. le bail 's possessions was ..
and one evening , after indulging in more than their fair ration of rum ..
if great-grandfather could solve the mystery of the box before arriving at port
until finally ...
we place a blank playing card into the box .

he got married , he didn 't play a game , next morning he died .
same thing happened to a bunch of people that i never even met before . you just ..

the sentinel program was originally conceived by dr. bolivar trask .
but covertly he had began experimenting only mutants .
there was one mutant who had discovered what he was doing
i knew her as raven
i tried to help her .
she hunted trask across the world
it was the first time she killed him .
but killing trask did not have the outcome she expected .
they captured her that day .
in her dna they discovered the secret to her power of transformation
and it all started that day in 1973
and end this war before it ever begins .
maybe a month but you 're talking about going back decades .
but the mind can only stretch so far before it snaps .
no one can survive that trip .
what if someone can heal as faster as rip apart .
take you position .
you need to go to my house and find me
logan you have to do for me what i once did for you
you have to be patient with me .
was an aberration
well
speak for yourself dr.trask .
you hah you do that with this enemy
and you will have lost two wars in one life time .
can i help you colonel ?
stand a side soldier . that 's an order .
at ease

so you 're saying that they took raven 's power and what ?
i think i do remember you now .
and i 'm gonna say to you what you said to us then
if you 're gonna wallow in self pity and do nothing
i told you there is no professor here .
he lost everything . erik , raven , his legs .
many of the teachers and students were drafted .
break into a highly secured facility
that 's illegal you know .
what 's there in for me ?
how do i know i can trust you ?
show him
where is the bathroom ? i need to pee .
thank you .

youl and charles
the treatment for my spine fixed my dna .
i sacrificed my power so that i could st
dry your eyes erik .
zou 've no idea what i have done .
well maybe you should have fought harder for them .
we were supposed to protect them !
hiding !
so you were always an asshole
we always said they would come after us .
when did you last see her ?
and how is she ?
ihow was she ?
you should be proud of her charles .
your cause .
you didn 't raise her . you grew up with her .
she made a choice .

gone .
we have to get out of here .
the likes of which the world has never seen .
and most importantly
what the hell are we dealing with here ?
what do you need to get these things operational ?
it 's going to cost a bit more to turn them on .
oh and one more thing if we do manage to capture them
i mean , to be like that
you think she has any family ?
if i see so much as a screw i 'll jam this into your throat .
you taught me well .
i miss you .
so the rest of us could live .
i received a message from the future .
you do not understand it 's not a question of being rusty
i feel like one of my students .
it was a mistake coming down here . it was a mistake freeing eric .
i 'm sorry logan they sent back the wrong man .
i 'm .
but i was the only one who could physically make the trip .
but i do know that a long time actually
and you unlocked my mind .
i don 't know how to do that for you
look into my mind .
so ... much ... pain .
and as frightening as it may be
it will make you more powerful than you ever imagined .

power is back on .
shut her down charles get in her head .
i 'm not strong enough yet .
it will set you on a path from which there is no return

if your guys wanted to fight , why didn 't they just get married ?
amateur .
you 're young and you 're dumb .
never thought you would call in that favor .
do you mind ?

it 's a great plan if it was 1985 .
you heard me .
let 's hear it .
okay . i 'm the plan . um ..
first , i hack the security grid main server .
pow . override the surveillance video and cctv systems .
it 's child 's play .
exactly like that .
ba-bam . ba-bam .
so , why 'd you let your team go ?
they didn 't seem too happy about it .
there are different kinds of family .
you 're talking pretty tough to a guy who 's incapacitated , which is good for you .
why don 't you cut me loose ?
hey , barn .
what do you say ? mix it up ..
you know ? make it snappy .
you should see me when i 'm angry .
so , come on , pal . anything you wanna get off your chest ?
you gonna take me back to the has-been crew ?
when we stop ,
the hague .
for the small-end money , as an employee .
but that 's a concept that somehow eluded you .
god , that stuff gets in the way . he thinks he 's the good guy .
you got a conscience , and that makes you weak .
not everyone 's as sick as you .
did you kill anyone today , barn ? blow any shit up ?
all dead because you couldn 't stay out of my business !
go on , do it !
oh , it 's hard to fathom . i can 't believe you forgot

sorry , mumi , papa , but with all due respect ,
doogie howser is on .
i suggest you go through with it .

i shower twice a day and wash my hands as often as i can .
but you 're a dentist . he 's nuts .

i 'm not hitting on her .
and you have no wrath .
our parents said so .

charlotte was a rare and gifted talent
this is the heart of charlotte .
ladies and gentlemen , our second judge for this evening ,
that is what i 've heard .
oh , jesus !
i hope it isn 't linked to what 's happening down south .
some sort of hemorrhagic fever near the hunan border .
we were just scouting in hunan .
i sure hope not .
pretty much , yeah .
that chinese vodka is brutal .
please . god , yes .
i need like 50 of them .
what is that ? hair of the dog ?
we 're on vacation , right ?
they 're in your hand . you have to get them out , lizzie .
it 's inside of you . you have to stop it .
oh , my god . charlotte , help me .
you know what you have to do .
good morning , you .
of course it does .
i am loki , of asgard
we have no quarrel with your people .
are you planning to step on us ?
free from what ?
freedom is life 's great lie .
yeah , you say " peace , "
this place is about to blow
i have men down . hill ?
i don 't know how many survivors .
i want every living soul not working rescue
coulson , get back to base . this is a level seven .
what do we do ?
i know how you wanted this evening to go .
who are you working for ?
tell him he is out .
.... you may have to write it down .
you listen carefully
put the woman on the phone , or i will blow up the block
are you kidding ? i 'm working .
i 'm in the middle of an interrogation .
i don 't give everything .
natasha ...
let me put you on hold .
i 'm actually out .
grow a spine , jarvis . i got a date .
of course they are . i was directly involved .
how does it feel to be a genius ?
what do you mean ? all this came from you .
give yourself some credit . please .
give yourself 12 % of the credit .
that was on you .
you mean our elevator ?
i 'm going to pay for that comment about percentages
i 'll tell you what .
on the lease .
sir , the telephone .
mr stark , we need to talk .
i said
is this not your natural state ?
the bright lure of freedom diminishes your life 's joy
in the end ,
there are no men like me .
look to your elder , people .
you know , the last time i was in germany ,
the man out of time .
loki , drop the weapon and stand down .
you might have missed a couple of things
yeah , there 's a lot of things fury doesn 't tell you .
what 's the matter ? are you scared of a little lightning ?
what are you doing ?
another asgardian ?
doesn 't matter .
stark , we need a plan of attack !
i 'd sit this one out , cap .
these guys come from legend . they 're basically gods .
and i 'm pretty sure he doesn 't dress like that .
you give up this poisonous dream !
i don 't have it .
but i 've sent it off , i know not where .
i 'm listening .
then don 't take my stuff .
shakespeare in the park ?
this is beyond you , metal man .
he gives up the cube , he 's all yours . until then ,
and for what ?
and then to be reminded what real power is .
he really grows on you , doesn 't he ?
so , thor , what 's his play ?
they 're not of asgard , nor any world known .
they will win him the earth ,
so , he 's building another portal .
loki has him under some kind of spell ,
he 's not leading an army from here .
that guy 's brain is a bag full of cats .
have care how you speak .
and he is my brother .
he 's adopted .
iridium ... what do they need the iridium for ?
i 'm just saying , pick a weekend .
keep love alive .
no hard feelings , point break . you 've got a mean swing .
that man is playing galaga .
how does fury even see these ?
sounds exhausting .
the only major component he still needs
when did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics ?
the packet , selvig 's notes , the extraction theory papers .
does loki need any particular kind of power source ?
what 's your secret ?
is everything a joke to you ?
threatening the safety of everyone on this ship
it 's all right , i wouldn 't have come aboard
well , they are repulsive .
when i first came to earth , loki 's rage followed me here ,
in my youth , i courted war .
you think you could make loki tell us
it 's not just power he craves , it 's vengeance , upon me .
a lot of guys think that
i 'm asking , what are you prepared to do ?
then why do i feel like he 's the only person on this boat
but you figured i 'd come .
this is a child at prayer .
you lie and kill
but they are part of you .
i won 't touch barton , not until i make him kill you .
and then he 'll wake just long enough to see his good work
sorry , computer was moving a little slow for me .
this does not mean that we 're making ..
what were you lying ?
the world hasn 't changed a bit .
you want to think about removing yourself
loki is manipulating you .
you didn 't come here because i bat my eyelashes at you .
i 'd like to know why s.h.i.e.l.d .
let 's see what we 've got .
i need you to get to that engine control panel
it seems to run on some form of electricity .
we are not your enemies , banner .
okay , the relays are intact .
even if i clear the rotors ,
if that thing gets up to speed , you 'll get shredded .
speak english !
it will slow the rotors down long enough for me to get out .
yeah , i got that .
sir , the mark 7 is not ready for deployment .
please tell me you 're going to appeal to my humanity .
you should have left your armour on for that .
it 's seen a bit of mileage ,
the sceptre
the tesseract can 't fight ,
you didn 't know what you were doing .
i built in a safety to cut their power source .
it may be able to close the portal .
sir , we will lose power before we penetrate that shell .
i wouldn 't consider him a role model .
you okay ? i know he meant a lot to you .
okay .
this , uh , this is something interesting boys and girls .
this is pretty cool .
i wonder why that is .
i 've never been to a funeral before .
i just never knew anyone that died .
i mean , when he died , we didn 't have a funeral ,
i didn 't know him very well , but i still really liked him .
it 's where luke was trained in the ways of the jedi .
when obi-wan came to luke on this very spot ,
what do you got for me ?
that 's it ?
well , why-why do you think i 'm here ?
is-is this the. the first time
i 've already had to say good-bye to 11 dr. whos .
hold on , hold on . easy now , we may need him .
i want a map to this phaeacia place .
phaeacia is a hundred people .
but i can lead you there .
well , if he screws with us ,
i can 't wait to kill him .
this should get interesting .
one bullet ? who the hell carries a gun with one bullet ?
get closer . zoom in .
these militants , how 'd they find them ?
hello .
omar had to go somewhere safe .
yeah , the war . that 's right .

i told you you would die .

we 're gonna find out
hey , roland !
wait , wait ! how did you get that to ..
me , too !
i got the love potion .
wait ! i got it for ..
but that 's not why the potion didn 't work .
she was already in love with someone else !
bingo !

and griselda blames me for the no-ove-in-the-dark-forest !
just saying .
we got security footage from the bus station .
no , i got it .

you can 't have open alcohol in a car .

an alien invasion , really ? at costco ?
oh , wait , no , i 'm not . i 'm still here for some reason .
uh , there 's a trauma on the way . here it is .
what was the dare ?
he 's still got some brain waves left , but barely . oh !
oh ! oh , my god ! oh , my god !
what , are you nervous ?
he 's just a guy who happens to have an award named after him .
you want to meet him , too .
thank you .
want to give us a hand here , yang ?
clamp .
i had to get my medication !
i 'm so
no , actually .
so we yell .
i 'm just telling them what happened !
she 's got a ruptured tendon in her knee that will need surgery .
so more waiting on her hand and foot ? brilliant .
they 're taking you for scans ! that 's all we said !
it 's a good thing that our young dr. avery
was it a student . webber ?
what :
grandpa !
it was a joke . he doesn 't get me .
uh . dr. webber decided to focus on his research .
dr. bailey is more than capable of performing the surgery ..
none taken .
what :
a year after mr. meyer 's lymphoma went into remission ,
well , . i mean , he could hear about it and like it
oh , come on .
so you think this could be an ex vivo lung case ?
i do not care .
he 's giving them the speech .
about the wonders of medicine .
sounds motivating .
and you hear it enough times
i didn 't know world-class surgeons had dinner tables .
if i just remove the bones , she 'll be able to hear again .
yeah .
yeah . she doesn 't have to be .
she doesn 't have to be deaf anymore .
you still want to fire me ?
no , sir . if i had to guess ,
it 's of a personal nature .
if your mother was still working here ,
dr. webber ,
i 'm not real sure .
why does he get to scrub in
you paged ?
my daredevil turned out to be a match .
no , i did not steal them .
nothing . i was just
it 's fine . i 'll go .
i 'm almost done here anyway .
yeah .
hey , it 's funny . did you see the guy 's face ?
okay ? and you have a choice here .
you can grown up ,
so just pick one .
look , it 's not gonna happen , all right ?
that 's all i ask .
well , this would go a long way to help that .
you 're not meeting him either .
that was never a thing . now leave .
i hate it when they know im related to him
brilliant , but really not easy to be related to .
what is it ? you paged ?
we never got a chance to finish our talk from this morning .
and you brought dr.grey. that 's good , actually .
and ... now you 're saying it worked ?
barring any complications .
would you like to see him ?
okay , come on .
it was an allergy caused by the suture .
that 's awesome .
yeah , i know . i get it .
you 're putting up walls and you 're avoiding him
but if she were here right now in a room upstairs ,
and you still can .
what :
and i am not trying to make him jealous .
i 'm getting kicked out of o.r.s for a reason .
bye . bye , teddy .
you 're okay making plans with my ex-boyfriend ?
plus , this is one of the many benefits of being gay .
well , i guess iam friends with pepper , so ..
when are you gonna stop bringing it up ?
daddy loves pepper .
that 's private .
i gotcha .
thank you for saving me !
boom !
okay , clearly it 's time to talk .
the gate was open all night .
what are you afraid of ? that some money 's gonna fly in
what now ?
no . no . wait . wait . slow down . what 's the story exactly ?
the wrapping paper .
how good was this bread ?
how many houses you hit ?
must 've been at least three .
it was very hard on me .

why don 't you come back ? stella !
ay , cam , thank you for helping me .
stella !

i was called away for an emergency .
where are you , dumb dog ?
i cannot believe that you did this to me yet again . oh .
i cooked a meal in our kitchen .
and i 'll sleep better knowing he 's got something to fall back on .
i can 't do it .
i don 't have what it takes .
it 's the truth , jay .

you tried hard , and that 's what matters .
you know where i can find some ?
i want to do it .
not what i hear . pick-up !
no , han , there 's plenty of sauce .
hey , are we sure that money sophie gave us was a gift ?
i know when i had money , i gave it out freely .
no , he really owned me .
and i wouldn 't even mention her gift .
nobody is expecting us to give the money back .
no , because it was a gift-a big-ass gift ,
yes , we do .
what 's happening ?
no , i need your help .
i was gonna make more , but i got my period .
whichever one makes me want to hurl the most ,
yeah , plus , if you do that outside our apartment ,
okay , what about sharing cocoa and a hot dog
makes me want to take my head off
and that , my friend , is love .
but i have even a better idea .
sophie , max has something she wants to say to you .
girls , i have something to say first .
yeah , seriously , i hadn 't eaten all afternoon .

my father 's not here , is he ?
during our first trial , we tested the chronicle
the radio waves bounced back ,
from where ?
we received a message from the future .
this is a fucking time machine ?
400 years ?
the message was simple , ethan .
i 'm not just going to abandon her .
this ain 't about saving the world , bro .
save her .
yeah , whoever sent the message , they 're not here .
why did they send you ?
i came to save you ,
well , who else is going to damn near kill themselves
we can 't save everyone , but i can save you .
no . no .
we 've got one shot at fixing this thing .
i can 't do it without you , brother , so let 's take control .
i need .. i need more time .

look , i don 't know what you 're thinking ,
then what the hell was all that about ?
you 're off your head . do you know that ? they 're waiting
we 'll have the cover we need . it 's now or never .
if everything works out today ,
that 's okay .
i bet you 're as ready

so let 's just hope that he does his job .
you gonna swim out , wait for the police to pass , and
you know what , you need to get backs
what are you going to do , shoot me ?
you need to think about what you 're doing .
when they get here , james and i , we 're leaving .
like you 've been playing me .
but it 's okay .
you do this , you may as well be shooting my son yourself .
hey , roldan .

i had a vision . i didn 't wanna believe it .
tony , i 'm gonna need you to focus .

this is your show , you go get him .
now , go get him so he takes the briefcase by himself .
the whole fucking thing was falling apart .
now i got to go mop up your mess .
you understand that he has ... . it wasn 't working .
did you ever have to find a way to survive ,
i would rather be on the taking side
i took it upon myself to drum up business .
became a con artist for real .
i was gonna survive no matter what .
stolen or forged art .
enjoy . come on .

he died this year , you know ?
sydney , sydney , i 'm sorry .
i didn 't want to upset you . sydney , please , i 'm sorry .
oh , god !
daddy !
you 're just such an artist ! look at that !
i respected him for that .
it was a tough situation for everyone .
that kid donovan is being mean to me .
i thought mommy was picking you up ,
and then after we put out the fire ,
did you know they made a lamp that has the sun in it ?
you cannot just stay in the house with a fucking sun lamp .
and i can 't ... i mean , look , i can 't trust you with danny when you ..
i can 't trust to leave you alone .
there is no fire . maybe if you were here more ,
just stop with the whole fire thing ! god ! it was a mistake !
those sun lamps are dangerous .
i bet that happens all the time .
you know that i could take danny ,
saw a hat store down the street
really ? it 's two lunches .
i was trying to get him to be more aggressive .
yeah , it 's ...
no . thank you .
yeah , it 's nice . you liked it ?
stop .
you like this guy ? yes , i like this guy .
no , it 's not messing with my judgment .
give a guy a chance .
paris ? i can call paris .
yeah , take your time . excuse me .
do whatever you need to do .
stick around for a little bit .
i 'm not moving anywhere , all right ?
on fraud ? what is that ? yeah , she may not be .
you may be from england , but you 're not royal ,
hey , not so .. oh , really ?

he wouldn 't let me see her for three days .
jesus christ , i put this lamp here for you
where 's the table and chair ? : there 's no bed here ?
jesus christ , it 's scary .
maybe it was my idea .
you know , i don 't know , maybe .
here , you want to have some tea ?
i thought that we had something
we 're gonna go to romania , we 're gonna take danny .
yes , that 's what i 'm saying
we 're us , we can make it an adventure like we did .
all right . okay ?
trust me , we have to leave right now .
no , you have to take me away .
no , what are you saying ? what are you doing ?
oh , my god . will you pull it together ?
don 't say i don 't love you . that 's bullshit .
i could never con you .
please don 't say this .
no , i 'm done .
i 'm gonna do these four busts , these four cons ,
we don 't need another move .
trust me , and you 're gonna be thanking me .
so i want to believe that we were real . we are real .
that 's a fake ?
not black-and-white , like you say .
irving , could i ..
you can 't meet the sheik , all right ?
we succeeded because we stayed small .
he bought stolen art , sold fake bank cd 's .

you know , you 're getting a little power-drunk , richard .
oh , no . i said we shouldn 't do any of it , irving ,
wait . what does that mean ?
how the fuck am i ruining america ?

i don 't think so . oh , you don 't think so ?

we 're dealing with a very clever individual .
think about it , all right ?
you got u.s. congressmen . you look good .
you know what doesn 't look good ?
i have a warrant for
yes .
i 've been listening to sheldon 's feelings on things for ten years .
yeah , but what if the experiment works ?
that 's what i said .
um , well , it 's , uh , black .
you ready to begin ?
i assume you don 't want wine .
you 're not supposed to drink alcohol
let 's just start .
although , i 'm concerned that level of politeness and charm
or if you 're familiar with the rules
just says " anyone in the world . "
thanks .
i 'm excluding the ones who aren 't of swedish tongue .
it has been 90 years since our last great feast
we already have so much to give back

i don 't wanna talk about it .
my apologies .
on the plus side , i read somewhere that , uh
like , what 's up , b ? you know ?
a card game ?
yeah , what is this , 1986 ?
how about we watch a movie ? everybody loves movies , right ?
do you like scary movies ? i love scary movies .
right .
ooh , another text coming in from jake .
that 's a great idea !
i mean , i can pack us a picnic .
well , yeah , if , uh , trissy wants to do that
see ?
i don 't really know , which is kind of troubling to me .
" that would be cool . ' 
just leave it there .
i don 't know . just , please , just give me a second to think .
they-they must have spread all across town by now .
i think they keep finding us because of bianca .
you know , you got a deep-ass voice for a nine-year-old .
yeah . i think they can smell her .
let 's um mandy and gregory .
or worse , up .
and as an added bonus ,
what about a game of tag on a french schoolyard ?
thanks for coming by .
well , i know more women are buying comics than ever ,
uh , i 've-i 've been stocking more female-oriented titles .
and , uh ,
anyway , so what dol got to do to-to
i mean , this woman 's actually on a leash like a dog .
maybe she kept jumping up on the couch .
like puss in boots .
he 'll get you to compare him to a dead virgin ,
then why didn 't you say that ?
well , i would prefer if people told me
i actually can 't say " don 't " enough .
maybe we can get sheldona prototype .
a machine that reads emotions is intriguing .
wouldn 't that be nice .
i could use those fears to destroy them .
now that sheldon 's across the hall ,
you could make it a train room .
i know , and amy says i can 't have a train room .
wonderful .
well , when you get the machine , you can find out .
oh , god . you went through with that ?
we are going to find out .
well , i want information in order to improve myself .
yeah , sure .
he didn 't know it till he was cuffed , but yeah .
how 's it working out ?
that 's great , i 'm happy for you .
oh , what , you are . aren 't you sweet ?
no , it 's my brother 's . i 'm trying
no , it doesn 't .
leonard , if you 're mad about this , just tell me .
you invited your drug dealer brother to stay with us
i didn 't think i needed your permission .
i think it loses its impact if we 're chatting about it .
i 'll just give them the finger .
howard is here to interpret for emily .
no , he doesn 't think it 's stupid .
okay , uh , let 's get things started .
want to kick it off ?
like this one ?
i did do that .
howard , would you write that down ?
and right now you 're just a , a cute , pink smudge wearing
yes , you are .
yeah , but that 's shooting fish in a barrel .
i 'm sorry . i shouldn 't have said that .
no , see , right there ,
he won 't be mad at me .
so you 're gonna throw me under the bus ?
uh , guys , it sounds like you 're getting angry again .
yes !
i am one !
let 's not wait so long for another bizarre , awkward night .
don 't beat yourself up .
maybe i won 't settle down .
yeah , the field was just here .
don 't worry about it . i can handle it .
she probably quizzed him in bed last night
uh , o 'malley , grey .
but there 's the biggest surgery in the world happening here today
you 're moving to the big leagues. what
a nice old lady with a hernia. you 're gonna fix it .
i know i should seem more enthusiastic ,
simple knee replacement .
i mean , it was a simple knee replacement it was nothing .
and , uh , it wasn 't until he was vomiting up dark red blood ,
and it wouldn 't have been fatal , but the blood thinners .
when she came back with that sandwich in her hand ,
killing him ...
all right , i am making the final dissection .
awesome .
no signs of infection . would you redress that wound ?
go to room 22-14 and ..
just take out the drain .. when you 're ready ?
sorry .
i 'm sorry . i 'm trying to listen .
like what
we 're gonna reserve judgment on that for right now
can we shove them in a locker ?
no . we 're professionals ,
we 'll never get to see the solo surgery or the face transplant
i don 't have family .
i 'm excited to meet them and show them my new face .
dave , um , after the surgery .
i 'd like you to practice on it now , okay ?
take three easy breaths and then blow .. into that .
both of you in the hall , now .
shepherd 's been gone all week .
you survived a war. mm-hmm .
i know i can do this . i 'm saying i don 't want to .
not when i say please .
o r . ' s set. transport 's on its way .
i 've been ready for 12 years .
yeah , after my surgery .
surprise !
get out !
you got the appointment. it 's in , like 15 minutes .
it usually takes weeks to get in there .
time for what ?
you know , i ... i went back .
i showed up for work , you know ?
you go dead inside because if you actually felt it ?
no way .
cristina , please .
swender 's the best surgical oncologist in this state .
why do you care so much ?
so the least you can do is
i know too much .
they 're gonna cut into my brain .
surgery fails all the time .
and even if they do everything right ,
if you don 't want my help ,
because i can 't do my job anymore .
you cannot do this alone .
you need your friends .
you threw a punch at your best friend ,
you been drunk for a few days . i was drunk for years .
i hope you come out of it soon .
i don 't think i can get her back
and when adele found out , somehow she ..
you can make your way back ..
this is year one of your residency .
you are doctors .
and , steve , go to the pit
because , yes , you are pregnant .
you ready dr . yang ?
i need one thing from you before i go under .
you haven 't answered my questions
i may just be a batty old lady to you ,
he said i was cheating .
even after he was down .
all i could think was ,
nothing like who ?
the formics are rebuilding and strengthening their fleet .
turn it off , please , john .
we must never again bear witness
thought i 'd have to ask to be by the door .
ender wiggin .
attention on deck !
my name is sergeant james dap .
but if you are looking for a shoulder to cry on ,
a great responsibility rests upon each of you .
millions of innocent lives were lost
and in the midst of that decisive battle ,
if you expect to compete
yes , sir .
you get one point for a hit to a limb ,
am i clear ?
ydear valentine . . so this is battle school
" the truth is we really don 't understand our enemy .
" the colonel said he expects me to lead
" so many , many things to learn .
" how are you ? is peter behaving ?
evening , launchies . at ease .
as you know , competition for command school is tough .
so , i may have the opportunity to promote some of you .
look to your right .
they are competition .
you said if we had a legitimate question .
you think you 're the smartest kid in this school ?
you will never be a commander ! i will never salute you !
give me 20 more !
you do not speak unless spoken to !
i ask for a replacement for o 'reilly
'm a quick study .
i intend to trade you asap .
are you okay ?
i can 't go back now .
they 've got half their toon back near their gate .
play dead .
got it .
smart move , holding wiggin back .
i had a brother
but use your arms , not your hips .
nightmares , launchie ?
you said the game would reveal his state of mind ,
he 's obviously feeling some psychological pressure ..
this is a boot camp for kids
together they create stories .
the stories reflect the child 's emotional reality .
i don 't know how these images got into the game .
very well .
highest battle room ratings .
i find it hard to respect someone
yes , sir .
no , sir .
i 'll say you taught me a lesson .
raise your fists .
come on , fight ! come on !
please , don 't lie to me .
so he can get better .
i can 't let you go .
i destroy them .
ender , they want me to talk you into going back .
i don 't think you 're hiding here
afraid you don 't know your enemy .
but what if you 're the next mazer rackham ?
but if you stay here ,
i 'll miss you , too .
attention ,
i thought we were going back to battle school .
we 're not sure .
we built our base here to be closer to their home planet ,
for the same reason that you kept kicking that bully
your training begins first thing tomorrow morning
we 're still re-seeding the atmosphere .
lights out in five .
look , this may be amusing to you ,
well , i won 't .
okay . you win .
i surprised you once .
i thought you were a teacher .
only he will tell you where you are weak ,
you will have to win this war one battle at a time .
trust we have chosen our commander well .
and a killer instinct too , i hope .
let 's hope he 's all you claim him to be .
goodnight
" being a third , i 've always been so afraid i might fail .
" but they made me a leader .
" i know if anything ever happened to you ,
if you 're going to use me , i need to be closer .
" as our training progresses ,
" some days , it 's hard to keep up . "
squadrons 43 through 57 ,
we need backup for bernard .
copy that . using 10 through 18 !
we can 't absorb these kind of losses !
sir , i can 't win if i don 't take any risks .
just don 't try and control everything
how can they be effective if they don 't get any sleep ?
a battle with the formics could last for days !
that can 't happen , understand ?
no . but you will be the last .
son , tomorrow colonel raokham will
you will be ready to face the real enemy .
one more simulation and i may have to go to war .
they 're spread too wide for a chain reaction .
just let him follow his instincts
alai ! you 're squadron five ! engage !
and you 're sure we 've killed every last one of them ?
how do you know if there was another colony ?
we won !
the way we win matters .
o on . we need to let him rest
please ?
it 's dark and scary out there .
what 's with the ducks ?
i used to hide things in ' em with i was little .
what are you hiding under here ?
i love you , honeybee .
i was done sleeping
" i am not a real duck . stay away .
honk , quack , quack , quack , honk . "
yeah , no , it 's in the fridge .
wife ...
after last night , you deserve to relax
what ?
bea . bea .
i kind of have a headache .
i feel like we should get a good night 's sleep .
oh , i don 't know . ii took some . advil , but this hea ...
i don 't know . i took some tylenol , but this headache won 't go away .
my tummy hurts .
yes .
what does that have to do with anything ?
why would you go ba ...
i was sleepwalking . i 'm confused .
last might , was horrible . today was horrible .
i don 't want to either .
i miss you . miss you .
sorry , sir , livestock shows are changing .
come on . i 'm not gonna say anything if you don 't say anything .
idiot .
easy .
stop this blood .
wait , wait , wait .
let 's just get the fuck out of here !
now , you wanna be a part of this , you go finish him .
go do it !
god , i gotta get out of here !
come on ! i gotta go !
so don 't sweat it .
remember i got a gun on you .
jack . people call me jack .
what 's your partner 's name ?
you say , " oliver , i got shot . this guy helped me . " nothing else .
it 's small but it hurts .
can we get this over with so i can go to a goddamn hospital ?
i need cash .
yeah , jack already told me .
you sit tight for five minutes , i 'm gonna call you an ambulance .
parker ?
yeah . then my dad came by .
was that .. was that a message , too ?
no stops , no calls .
how long ?
what if you 're not ?
empty the cash out of the storage locker and disappear .
i 'll get it to you by the end of the week . i swear .
if you repossess my car , i can 't pay you .
great . thank you . next week at the latest .
so you lived in san antonio your whole life ?
tell the truth , i was born in ecuador .
ecuador ? really ?
i was in the management training program here before i got married .
you know , do you mind if i hold on to these ?
yeah , sure . i mean , they 're all sold .
here . my card , too .
i know that you 're in town alone , so , if you 'd like ,
i 'll be in touch .
plans .
the girls would love to see you !
jesus christ . i 'm over this shit . i 'm sick of beans .
what ? that 's bullshit .
we 'll go . but we call it in , we go and we pick it up
thanks again .
oh , my god ! mi dio ! i can 't believe he 's not barking !
what do you need ?
there 's so much blood ! what do you do when there 's so much blood ?
i need you to listen ..
leslie !
do we get a towel ? do we get a ... what ?
okay , okay , i can do that .
then go straight to work .
so , how 'd the lecture go ?
really ? triumphant ?
thirsty for knowledge , drinking in my wisdom .
oh , please let me tell him .
tell me what ?
rai , if you would .
that 's rather unfair .
plus , insects have six legs .
i think i 'll turn in .
yeah , it 's weird . even though he didn 't want
it 's like accidentally walking into a gay bar
are you guys doing okay ?
well , that shouldn 't be too hard .
i have to go . i have a customer . bye-bye .
i 'd like a frozen yogurt , please .
luckily , we sell both shoes and yogurt here .
yes . look up at the sign ,
yes .
what ?
okay , you know what ?
oh , and we 're going to use props ?
i had dreams , you know .
show everybody back home i could be someone .
i 'm still not adjusted
i 'm glad you asked .
and you think it 's better than tennessee williams ?
where no sheldon has gone before .
but zola hasn 't eaten because of the surgery .
you might want to try to soothe her with the pacifier .
chupo . oh , yes . there you go . ooh .
all right . i 'll call you when i 'm ready to come take her up .
are you excited ?
i-i feel like things could be good with us .
i mean , besides , i have too many obligations here .
okay . you just listed me as an obligation .
so the checklist is the first page
like grandpa had ?
whoa , whoa . what are you talking about ?
just to be sure , okay ?
dr. hunt , bed seven is admitted for observation ,
and focused and efficient .
well , i 'll take him .
proper protocol is to page dr. altman .
nobody move . gown me . i 'm going in .
right over here .
yeah , it 's extremely rare .
dr. baily , grab his foot
believe it or not , it 's missed about 50 % of the time .
and not just for her insurance .
i need to get my own insurance ,
just a ... oh .
aren 't you supposed to mend them ?
i need to remember why i love being a surgeon so much
just a sprained ankle , hairline fracture , anything .
oh , my god . anytime i hear a baby cry ,
wait . that really sounds like her .
it 's bring your daughter to work day .
i bathed her , changed her .
who 's gonna give him his vaccination ?
what ?
go there . go back with them .
they 're looking for someone who 's single , unattached ,
they 've already been coordinating with you .
well , that 's pretty far to go for a follow-up exam .
so you just think about it .
you are screwing with my career .
you 're a surgeon ,
you will hate it and you will resent it
just be excellent at what you are .
yes .
i 'm not going to africa .
howard and rai helped me bring it up .
they 're lawn chairs .
did it occur to you that was by design ?
what am i doing in your spam folder ?
that was hilarious .
i 'm getting to it .
they don 't get a vote .
and according to the roommate agreement ,
and i said yes .
change seats with me .
there 's a draft on my neck over here .
you 're protected by your turtleneck .
thror 's love of gold had grown too fierce .
it was a sickness of the mind .
.... bad things will follow .
this was a hobbit hole .
and all the comforts of home .
what 's this ?
it 's not ready yet .
reading .
replies to the party invitations .
they all say they 're coming .
be a good lad and put that on the gate .
who ?
oh-ho . he wouldn 't miss a chance to let off his whizpoppers .
.. by belladonna took 's son as if i were selling buttons at the door .
you 've changed , and not entirely for the better , bilbo baggins .
well , you know my name , although you don 't remember i belong to it .
and gandalf means ..
who made such excellent fireworks ?
no idea you were still in business .
where else .. ? ahem .
even if it 's only my fireworks .
it 'll be very good for you ...
i shall inform the others .
we do not want any adventures here , thank you . not today . not ..
good morning .
careful with these . i just had them sharpened .
yeah .
what ? no , it 's been in the family for years .
fili , kili . come on , give us a hand .
shove this in the hallway . otherwise we 'll never get everyone in .
go away and bother somebody else .
if this is some clot-head 's idea of a joke ..
get off , you big lump !
those are my pri .. ! excuse me , not my wine . put that back . put that back .
it 's a tad excessive , isn 't it ? have you got a cheese knife ?
no , that 's grandpa mungo 's chair .. no , so is that . take it back , please .
that is a book , not a coaster . and put that map down .
yes ?
oh , no , thank you , dori . a little red wine for me , i think .
yes . ah .
we appear to be one dwarf short .
mr. gandalf ? a little glass of red wine , as requested .
oh . cheers .
no chance . not from that distance .
bombur , catch !
my dear bilbo , what on earth is the matter ?
what are they doing here ?
i don 't want to get used to them .
.. chiefest and greatest calamity of our age .
teeth like razors , claws like meat hooks .
yes , i know what a dragon is .
good lad , ori !
the task would be difficult enough with an army behind us ...
and not 13 of the best .
and you forget , we have a wizard in our company .
oh , well , no . i wouldn 't say ...
what ?
go on . give us a number .
if we have read these signs ..
rumors have begun to spread .
eyes look east to the mountain , assessing ..
perhaps the vast wealth of our people now lies unprotected .
you forget , the front gate is sealed .
that , my dear balin , is not entirely true .
it was given to me by your father .
it is yours now .
there must be a door .
there 's another way in .
the answer lies hidden somewhere in this map ...
but there are others in middle-earth who can .
funeral arrangements ?
understood .
agreed .
" present company shall not be liable for injuries inflicted by ..
a young hobbit who would have liked nothing better ...
the world is not in your books and maps .
i can 't just go running off into the blue .
you are also a took .
.. was so large , he could ride a real horse ?
yes , well , he could .
he swung his club so hard , it knocked the goblin king 's head clean off ..
heh , heh . hardly the stuff of legend .
old warriors .
over an army from the iron hills .
loyalty , honor ...
i can ask no more than that .
you have a choice .
you have built a new life for us in the blue mountains .
we will see it done .
here , mr. bilbo , where are you off to ?
late for what ?
i said it . didn 't i say it ? coming here was a waste of time .
whose idea was it anyway ?
i signed it .
welcome , master baggins ...
give him a pony .
thank you . i 'm sure i can keep up on foot .
what was that ?
throat-cutters . there 'll be dozens of them out there .
they strike in the wee small hours when everyone 's asleep .
you think that 's funny ?
we didn 't mean anything by it .
you know nothing of the world .
that filth died of his wounds long ago .
it is raining , master dwarf ..
you should find yourself another wizard .
other wizards . there are five of us .
then there are the two blue wizards .
and who is the fifth ?
right you are .
we could make for the hidden valley .
... i will not go near that place .
we could get food , rest , advice .
we have a map that we cannot read . lord elrond could help us .
a dragon attacks erebor .
orcs plunder moria ...
how come he 's the cook ? everything tastes the same .
except the chicken .
i 'm just saying , a little appreciation would be nice .
just needs a sprinkle of squirrel dung .
sorry . ow !
wrap your laughing gear around that , eh ?
that 's why i 'm the cook .
what on earth are you doing here ?
something 's wrong .
yes ?
oh . i had a thought and now i 've lost it .
oh . it 's not a thought at all .
this was your plan all along .
you have no enemies here , thorin oakenshield .
you think the elves will give our quest their blessing ?
of course they will . but we have questions that need to be answered .
and respect .
which is why you will leave the talking to me .
ah . lindir .
i must speak with lord elrond .
not here ?
close ranks !
something or someone has drawn them near .
welcome , thorin , son of thrain .
you have your grandfather 's bearing .
indeed ? he made no mention of you .
does he offer us insult ?
well , in that case , lead on .
i don 't like green food .
have they got any chips ?
not really dressed for dinner .
what are you saying , my sword hasn 't seen battle ?
more of a letter opener , really .
we found them in a troll-hoard on the great east road
our business is no concern of elves .
it is the legacy of my people .
save me from the stubbornness of dwarves .
you stand in the presence of one of the few in middle-earth ..
thorin , no .
what is your interest in this map ?
as you know , this sort of artifact sometimes contains hidden text .
moon runes ?
an easy thing to miss .
moon runes can only be read by the light of a moon ...
can you read them ?
but if he should side with the enemy ...
what enemy ?
sauron is vanquished . he can never regain his full strength .
are we ? are we at peace ?
they are raiding villages , destroying farms .
always you must meddle ...
let him speak .
he 's a foolish fellow .
it 's not that . it 's his excessive consumption of mushrooms .
i 've warned him .
it looks safe enough . search to the back .
there 's nothing here .
no . no fires . not in this place .
we start at first light .
that was the plan .
where do you think you 're going ?
no , no , you can 't turn back now , eh ?
i 'm not , though , am i ?
i 'm not a took , i 'm a baggins . i don 't know what i was thinking .
start with the youngest . wait !
look who it is .
... king under the mountain .
and you 're not a king ..
i know someone who would pay a pretty price for your head .
nothing attached .
an old enemy of yours .
is it soft ? is it juicy ?
i 'll use this if i have to .
just show me the way to get out of here and i 'll be on my way .
what are you going to do now , wizard ?
well , that could have been worse .
gandalf !
only one thing will save us , daylight !
wait !
hey , look at that .
okay , you have every right to be mad .
you do make more money than me .
and i 'm so sorry .
how long have you had this secret account ?
well , how much you got in there ?
$ 47 once my nana 's birthday check gets here .
no , i do , and that 's why i hid it .
uh , uh , you have shoes you love , but never wear .
i 'm angel . i have acute myeloid leukemia .
hi , i 'm pj . um , i have neuroblastoma .
i 'll spare you the gory details of patrick 's ball cancer .
they cut most of it out , and he almost died , but he didn 't die .
all right , ii guess .
why don 't i play another song ?
so ... . was it awesome ?
i couldn 't breathe . no one could get it under control .
don 't be afraid .
oh , my god .
republic of cancervania for not working
but for some reason it 's been working for me .
for , i don 't know , a while maybe .
i got my ged , so i 'm taking classes at mcc .
well , that explains the aura of sophistication .
oops .
no , it 's not that kind of a book .
uh , cancer .
but not like that . trust me , it 's amazing
who , a , understands what it 's like to be dying ..
okay .
that does not include zombies or stormtroopers .
and i don 't know how long i have left to get answers to them .
" but i would just really like to know .
" i would love to read it .
" yours , with great admiration , hazel grace lancaster . "
yeah , i mean , it 's a bit pretentious ..
i think he 'll like it .
is it ?
i should probably go to sleep .
perhaps " okay " will be our " always . "
" dear ms. lancaster ...
ii was 13 .
i was 13 .
and epcot center . oh , my god .
don 't know how long it will stay that way .
it 's true .
they have doctors in amsterdam . and cancer .
i also don 't really want this particular life .
and there 's this pathetic old swing set ... .
it 's just everything , i guess .
i do see your point .
hazel grace , i hope you realize ..
" so o tos oy an oo son
oh , my god .
everything . we 're just so good .
i love you so much .
gus , you 're so inventive
okay !
i 'm really sorry about that . no , it 's totally fine .
see this little friend right here ?
they are augustus and hazel ...
you invited them .
you know why i left america , lidewij .
you 're american .
let 's imagine you 're racing a tortoise .
in the time it takes you to run ten yards ...
you 're faster than the tortoise , but you can never catch him , you see ?
now , certainly , you can run past the tortoise ..
but the question of " how ? " turns out to be so complicated ..
i assume that answers your question .
yet you seemed so intelligent in print , mr. waters .
can we , for one second , just focus on anna ?
i understand that the story ends in the middle of a sentence ..
i am not interested in talking about that book .
right ?
but you promised !
they cease to exist the moment the novel ends .
i get it in a literary sense or whatever , but
of course you do !
you are fated to live out your days ... .
as the child you were when diagnosed .
and we as adults , we pity this .
peter , that 's enough .
that cares little for individual lives .
it 'll be better than any piece of shit that drunk guy could write .
it 'll have blood , and guts , and sacrifice .
so sorry that i spent your wish on that asshole .
hazel and auoustus !
circumstance has made him cruel .
that he could see that his work has shaped real lives .
perhaps we can do some sightseeing ? have you been to the anne frank house ?
so we 've come here seeking revenge .
but between the three of us , we have five legs , four eyes .
but we also have two dozen eggs ..
you know , something they would publish in all the papers , and ..
you are special , augustus .
i do know what you mean , i just don 't agree with you .
don 't get mad .
i 'm mad because i think you 're special . and is that not enough ?
and i 'm gonna remember you .
il just wish you would be happy with that .
it 's a good life , hazel grace .
oh , augustus .
is the convention known as the " last good day "
the problem , of course , is that there 's no way of knowing ..
at the time , it 's just another decent day .
good evening , hazel grace .
however , just in case it doesn 't work out ..
ready ?
but we forgave him .
or because he only got 19 years when he should 've gotten way more .
dude , come on . really ?
interrupt me in the middle of my eulogy . you 're supposed to be dead .
and they tell me to try them on ..
because gus , i don 't even want to see a world without you .
i don 't want to see a world without augustus waters .
sounds awesome .
this is just so hard .
yeah .
to the right , a little bit .
it 's down to you , hazel grace
and augustus waters was the star-crossed love of my life .
and i probably won 't be able to get more than a sentence out
as it should .
because there 's really no one else
so , instead , i 'm gonna talk about math .
there are infinite numbers between zero and one .
and an infinite collection of others .
or between zero and a million .
but , gus
hold on .
within the numbered days .
i am eternally grateful .
i love you , too .
when the cancer , which was made of him ..
the whole thing .
one of the first things they ask you in the er ..
i 've been asked this question hundreds of times ...
when i couldn 't catch my breath and it felt like my chest was on fire
your boy waters and i corresponded quite a bit in his last days .
i wouldn 't exactly call him a fan .
but he was quite insistent i attend his funeral ...
so here i am .
you 'll want to read this .
please get out of my car ! fine .
i 'm so , so sorry .
it was a privilege , though , wasn 't it ?
gives you an idea how we feel about you .
do you know if it hurt or whatever ?
it wasn 't great or anything
i know .
it was annoying . he talked about you so much .
i know . i know you didn 't .
ew . he 's not my friend .
well , i was talking to him at the cemetery ..
yeah , well , i 'm over it .
no , he didn 't write it . gus wrote it .
apparently gus wrote something down and then sent it to van h
you 're a shitty person , but a good writer .
let 's roll !
yeah , come on . move it .
your infamous brother would be proud .
hmm , try not to see this as punishment
" prepare to taste a full turbo charge of .. " um ...
what 's that in your hand ?
what 's it about ?
that 's rad
oh , do you want to play hide and seek ?
before we go , i just have to take care of something
um . himm .
i 've been thinking . i don 't know , do you think it 'd be a better idea
no . no . no , but i mean , do you really think we stand a chance ?
a man with a good plan has already won half the battle .
right now , the plan is to take a piss .
what a cheap move .
soon you 'll have to learn how to fix it by yourself .
good morning !
what are you doing here ?
what ? you 're " ii , " i tagged you !
oh , look at the bird ..
you 're friggin ' fast .
i always want to see something cool
used to walk the earth a long time ago .
it 's kind of like what happened to us ,
as you may know , the situation is critical .
we have reached maximum casualty level .
we have to hit these damn machines with everything we 've got .
where is she ?
my beloved followers , we have a very special guest with us here this evening .
now , frederick wishes to be reunited with his loving brother .
i bet you 're wondering what this contraption is , hmm ?
there is in the average human body ?
the bones themselves , 25 %
ten gallons , which this machine is designed to extract .
ah , ha
hey there , sleepy head .
we 're on a couch
that was really sweet of you .
i just wish i could have done more , you know ?
yeah , maybe you can 't ,
instead , i let you get shot . hmm .
i 'm just losing some hearts
shut down ? you mean you 'll die ?
holy shit !
don 't you think you 're taking this comic book shit too far , huh ?
no , no , no , no , no .
ut that back
hey , what are you doing ? you 're leaving ?
frederick the arm-wrestler is gone !
you could have this
you need to head north ,
you might have some luck finding whatever it is you 're looking for there .
now that 's all i know , so leave me alone . hmmm ?
over here !
stupid piece of god damn shit .
i mean , how could this day get possibly fucking worse ?
are you sure ?
see , i have seven point five hearts left .
oh , i can eat , i can drink , i can sleep , i can breathe .
i mean , cos you know ,
and , plus , you 've got some pretty serious fighting skills too .
i mean , what i was going to say is that ,
so , your mom is up there ?
it 's weird , i , uh .. i never told anyone about my parents before .
no worries , it could happen to anybody .
promise .
lower your hammer please , that won 't be necessary .
thank you .
that 's exactly what i needed .
because this is my land .
83 . come in if you hear me . give us a visual , anything
83 , come in . give us a sion you 're down there .
but there was no turning back now .
sir . no visual , no audio . she 's not responding .
hey everyone ! now let 's see some school spirit .
v i k i .. okay .
some of them spell by themselves , huh .
our campus is now a nut free zone .
have like 2 cambodians and 1 mexican .
yeah .
not usually , but okay .
no . i 'm actually more on the engineering side .
oh , look at that . wow .
av geek .
come this way brother . shining like a rock star .
have fun with recina .
megan , hi .
i don 't blame you . if i wasn 't such a strict vegan ,
you know that guard totally would have seen you .
stealth mode ?
no way you can just tip top down the hall .
his not ?
alienating the target from those closest to him .
right um .
thanks babe .
yeah . no doubt .
why did you run away ?
i couldn 't just raise my hand and say :
okay . let 's get to the bottom of this .
nobody . i 'm not working for anybody , i promise .
aziz , fortaz , zerbaro when the hell were you in levionac .
they make these amazing garlic knots .
i just want to be normal .
you are parker and you are liz .
hell yes , i am .
every morning , you dress yourself in this cloak of sarcasm .
you be force to forge your connections with the near peer group .
go back to fail , elizabeth .
you talk funny .
you sensitive boy with no father figure .
she 's so get to you .
you okay ?
hyper vigilant , domineering , intrusive any of those work .
my foster parents can be pretty controlling sometimes .
more like solitary confinement .
i was never really given the chance to figure out what i want
that 's cool . cos sometimes i wish i had a way out .
i guess it 's just the time for something new .
okay . prune megan .
when i heard you died in the field . it was the worst day of my life .
dude , what is happening ?
to senator benjamin burke .
confederate general corbin dandridge refused to come peacefully .
two other warrants have been served .
to those who truly believed in the confederate cause
these people thought that justice would never find them .
harlan
you killed a general .
night and day . i was asking folks from the mississippi to the colorado .
said he 'd heard of a man fought on the losing side in the war making a living down south .
there was wolves picking at the bones .
and where would a man like me go , mathias ?
the trail , this horse , this job .
you know settling down in old age would not suit me .
i must say i 'm not in a very trusting or kindly way today .
you state your business with him
you came to say good bye ?
right now i m not the brightest , warmest fire on the coldest , darkest night .
no forgiveness needed , sir .
did not
our paths have not crossed until just now , sir .
i waited a long , long time for someone like you to come .
i did a bunch of terrible things in the war
i know you got it .
read it and make it proper .
you don 't need to call me captain .
that was a long time ago .
shoot me right here in my bed .
are you gonna drag me out by the goddamn willow tree ?
and i 'll be goddamned if i 'm gonna think of my daughter going to visit her mother 's grave
i will let you pass as god sees fit .
it 's my job to watch men like you take their last breath .
heavy burden , isn 't it , son ?
more than all right , mam .
why carry two ?
such firepower must be of mighty importance .
but then it 's none of my business what you do .
why 's that ?
heck , we can barely keep ourselves alive .
one man in particular goes by the name of quaid .
now that father is dying , he sees a greater opportunity .
this is tough country
that 's a long time .
i 'm a detective .
you know , he became a different man after the war .
he was afraid .
and that 's why he up and took us all the way out here to the middle of nowhere .
my mother well , this land was just too hard for her .
and for quite some time , i did blame him for that .
bring that chair over here so i can look you in the eye .
i need you to help me to the afterlife .
oh no , it 's gotta be out of sight .
what about poison ?
murderous ?
what the hell is the difference between hanging me out there
poisoning you is murder .
here , get comfortable , i 'll bring you some towels .
do you mind if i help ?
hazards of the occupation .
i think there must be plenty of other men
but it is all some of us have .
i 'll see that he 's properly tended to
room eight , that end of the hall .
give me a little more of that , darling .
a new face is always refreshing
care to go upstairs to that room of yours
honey , how about a ride , darling ?
and why is that ?
what 's this swinging dick got that i ain 't got ?
and who the hell even are you , mister , huh ?
i 'm just a short stop on a very long journey .
is that a fact
jasper , please , don 't do this .
the customer hasn 't done anything .
ou sure you want to draw that pistol on a man you never met , boy ?
whiskey 's got your mind all screwed up like a river that doesn 't run straight .
before i do , ill give you a little information just in case you feel like drawing that steel .
can you say the same ?
but i do think i have the advantage here .
if i know my deputy
make sure he has a good look-over
he was , he was here all night with honey .
and what are we gonna do about that , honey ?
i 'll give ' em all the money back .
nine , 10 , 11 , 12 .
thieves of any kind will suffer the consequences .
i expect you to follow them .
why not just leave this place ?
some of us have a past that we have run from
drag his ass out .
was a rough place as one can imagine any town that just struck silver might be .
wearing that badge is a privilege , not an opportunity .
you see , before i settled here ,
nd i have met many through the years , all kinds .
too calculated , too professional .
and i thought , who could have done such a thing ?
general corbin dandridge .
ah , a man of vision , a man of dreams .
and what are men to do , jasper
that 's mine .
let 's see here , detective mathias breecher .
see ?
i 'm sorry .
really ?
though she didn 't know it , bree had answered her own question .
is to replace it with another .
and you said that you didn 't want us coming by your house .
look , we spent a lot of money on that .
is there a problem here ?
we were all crammed under this little gazebo thingy .
i loved it !
all our friends gathered close around us ?
you said it was the happiest day of your life .
i could not ask for anything more .
see you around , i hope.all right .
what do you mean ?
and if i did , certainly would call donna .
oh , that 's good.so why are you calling ?
bree .
you spent 12.95 on earl 's record ,
he deserves to play at that jazz club .
i appreciate your enthusiasm , but of all of us here ,
and that ruby woman
if i own one .
sir , we 're here to see ruby .
she 's coming in real hot , max .
there 's only one old woman who scares me ,
i don 't need someone to tell me that i 'm pretty .
what do you little girls want ?
of earl ?
from the early birds .
here , hold my hoops
i mean , he 's just a cashier at a diner now .
earl is more than just a cashier .
how dare you !
hold my hoops !
he 's not a cashier . he 's a musical genius .
well , i mean , it doesn 't have to be a dead-end .
okay , i don 't know whose hoops are whose .
isn 't that exciting . earl ?
i 'm gonna go ahead and call it a comeback .
i sang " god bless the child . "
i don 't think i ever remember you playing sober .
i did ?
you know what wasn 't clever ?
anyway , break a leg .
you 're good at that .
girls , i just realized ...
excuse me , ladies .
you don 't think " freshen up " means ..
no . earl 's been clean for 30 years .
i 'll just go take a peek .
you know what 's not in the bathroom ?
damn it ! i forgot i invited people .
well , i love it .
i like going downtown .
where 's han ? '
that 's your whole night in secaucus !
sophie , relax . it 'll be fine .
hold my syringe while i get my credit card .
oh , earl , how you doing ?
no . these are sophie 's fertility drugs .
or , for instance , look in the backseat , tell me what you see .
no , sir .
you and i are gonna open up a video store , rick .

and somehow the dinosaur got into the pile ,
if you breathe one word
one can only hope .
and i understand if you need to hate me .
you came into my life hoping
you 'll always have a hole in your heart

i would have never gotten here if it hadn 't been for you .
meredith , please . help me teach them .

and my whole body went cold .
right now ...
now what do you do ?

lilith is in l.a. for a reason .
well , it could be our only shot .
who knows how long it 'll be before we find her again .

i don 't go .
what the fuck did you just say ?
that what you think ?
you 'd be doing me a favor .
we 'll wait till dark .
i don 't see them .

outlook for the week continues to be rather gloomy .
temperatures cooling down
like it was the last of my business .
... i was gonna finally go home ..
sit on my porch ....

mr. washington 's own traumatic memories .

the prime memory detective agency in the world
john .. how are you ?
you 're still taking the medication ?
well , you 're lucky the stroke was mild .
you know , john , maybe it 's time to get back in the running .
it 's been two years .
and you know it wasn 't your fault .
ah , don 't worry about it . don 't worry !
i 'm sorry .
heard senator rockford on .. tv
rockford hired him . lundgren ?
yeah , but gifts like yours need to be used
what 's the matter ?
what i was wondering was whether i could do something for mindscape .
i might have something you 're right for , perfect actually .
oh , you 're kidding
very special girl .
maybe a viewer can .
she 's on a hunger strike . all you have to do is get her to eat
if you didn 't wanna sell the beach house .
anna 's still refusing to eat , trying to pressure them ..
she 's very fragile , so tread carefully .
thank you so much for working on anna 's case .
and her iq score came back off the charts .
she stopped eating one week ago .
in my opinion , she should be .. in a place that can provide the proper care .
mr. washington , ah .. as i 'm sure you can appreciate ..
i will need you to sign a non-disclosure contract .
of course .
i think there are better words for it .
i would say haunted
oh , i 'm sorry .
not well , lately ... but he 's tried to do his best for her .
is there any specific reason why anna is refusing to eat ?
i 'm sure sebastian told you about her cutting herself
to protect her , from herself .
the gentleman i told you was coming to visit .
can i have a seat ? can i have a seat ?
we won 't guess the next one for sure , so go ahead , make yourself comfortable .
what 's the metronome for ?
much .
there 's this girl about your age at her mother 's funeral .
she gets to meet him , briefly .
she falls in love with him , right there and then .
and two days later. this girl kills her own sister .
her motive is she wants to meet the guy again .
qh , there 's no right answer .
why is that ?
with the second test , i gave you the answer you were looking for
why ?
and it was her mother 's funeral where she met this guy ...
there would be a higher probability that the
she 's my daughter !
can i play with you ?
what are you up to ?
you can 't do that ! you can 't just ..
don 't you think i 'm thinking about her ?
this is not the place for her , michelle !
i 'll let you out when you realize that spying on people is wrong .
she 's different , michelle .
a guy like you always has a picture in his wallet .
if you agree to eat something
robert desperately wants to put me away .
well then , let 's flip out together .
you and that you 'd find out his secret plans .
am i right ?
you 're the only person they 're gonna trust .
won 't survive that .
judith , did you see ... anna push you down the stairs ?
i 'm here for you .
i know i went to bring her some food .
why don 't you go to my memory ?
how do you know it wasn 't robert ?
judith , i know .
i know about you and robert .
whatever , doesn 't matter .
i hope you get better soon .
i 'll have sebastian 's assistant send it to you right away .
it 's strong stuff , john .
and it should have been , john .
look they 're gonna put anna in an institution .
are you sure you want to continue with the case ?
i 'll call you in a couple of days .
that 's pretty obvious .
what made you try to kill yourself ?
blood .. it 's red
my mother 's trying harder , i suppose , but it 's still pretty pathetic .
do you really want to know the answer ? please .
that school was depressing . he was nice .
would you mind if i take a picture of you ?
where the blood sprayed across the floor .
do you want to die , anna ?
it 's kind of a freedom .
not if you 're not allowed to have it .
will you lift your chin a bit ?
like the whole world disappears .
all right , finished .
not yet .
it 's what the people here call me .
so susan merricks your roommate .
i heard she was training for the olympics , had a nervous breakdown ..
oh , great ! frigid and mousey are here .
doesn 't mean you have to be in the room all the time , frigid .
someone broke into the principal 's house and stole all the alcohol .
house mother , you 're talking to someone ..
drinking is the devil 's calling card .
i 'm so , so sorry about the closet . i ..
some friends are coming over to tea tomorrow . do you want to join us ?
what , mousey ? she 's such a retard .
do you copy your roses from the rose bushes out there ?
sometimes we remember things the way we want to ,
a lack of detail
those three girls at school that same year .
but no one could ind out who she was .
i 'd love that family to finally get what 's coming to them .
you a few questions about anna greene ?
no , i 'm not a cop , ms. merrick .
no .. not at all
now , i 'm sorry , but i have to go .
i know it must have been extremely painful .
do you have any specific memory of anna you think i should know ?
anna seriously has balls . she was like drinking is the devil 's calling card .
hey , anna , do you want a cup ?
you sure ?
and coming back ... . now .
so you didn 't poison those girls ? of course , not
not to mention hiding the poison under my bed
maybe you just didn 't have time to hide the poison .
why didn 't you go to the cops ?
why not ?
what are you talking about ? there 's no megan at the school .
and left right after i got expelled .
please tell me , john !

here ! my yearbook !
sleep with it under your pillow , for all i care
can you do that for me ?
john , why don 't you help me ?
mom !
you looked cute while you were sleeping
to what ? have strong feelings for your therapist ?
your teacher was a lot older than you , he took advantage .
he said they were for art , and at first they were artistic
you should be focusing on the sessions , not investigating in the real world .
there is something going on there behind the scenes
and that you are becoming too personally involved .
do you know where you want to go ?
when you 're ready , close your eyes .
my parents brought him to me . who ?
what are you doing over there , anna ?
come here , sweetheart .
take this
now ... . you get better .
i always felt safe there .
i can 't thank you enough , john .
if i know you have it , then at least i know that there 's someone out there ..
i might not be going to an institution .
she has a need for control
in forming and maintaining long-term relationships with others .
and keeps out everything else . it 's great .
locking her up is the worst possible thing you could do .
until it was evident that i was innocent .
over and over again , and looked at it with a fresh set of eyes .
are there any questions ?
that 's a good question .
aren 't they great ? better than what you had before .
i need to see you , john .
before it 's too late !

where are danford and al-hady ?
well , then our intelligence is bad .
north 2-0 , showman 5-0 , i have my men ready . do we go in ?
i 'm well aware of that , general ,
there are two vehicles outside , we have the ability to follow only one .
surely you have agents on the ground who could intercept ?
we 're trying to minimize collateral damage .
but he has also assessed a projected loss of life
a 65 % assessment requires us to do whatever we can
if we wait and they leave ,
james ! you have the authority to make a decision !
sir , the pm is giving a speech in strasbourg this afternoon ,
yes , sir .
yes .
perhaps there could be an assessment of the impact of the damage right here .
what if you put the missile there ?
sergeant , we need to make this work .
we are locked into this kill chain .
there are many lives at risk .
i think ...
there i could predict a 45 % possibility of fatality .
if you would look at the diagram .
we have now done everything in our power to give this girl a chance to survive .
minister .

see if you can switch with ross .
it 's that ross knows what i want before i even ask for it .
shepherd , this is alana cahill .
derek shepherd .

i didn 't fall in a damn field . i fell in my damn yard .
oh , he was conscious the whole damn time .

thank you , doctor .
i 'm afraid not .
what are you doing ?
i thought you were trying to talk dirty .
i was talking out loud ?
though i was weirdly kind of into it .
kepner 's running me ragged .
you know , if you 're too busy for this ,
i am too busy for this .
thank you for understanding .
of course you 're gonna make mistakes .
leave it behind you , the sooner the better ,
move past it , and get your butt on that plane .
who 's going portland ?
you and i are going to portland .
so , wilson , what do you see ?
just calm the waves .
what is wrong with this woman ?
should she even be in the o.r. ?
okay .
i 'm sorry . i don 't see a twitch .

and bed 13 ?
good job , edwards . you passed .
ah , sorry to interrupt .
kinda .
you don 't seem to slow down .
maybe grab a cup of coffee ?
now you think i 'm some sort of creeper . i 'm not .
i 'm sorry , but these children ,
and if you stop the program ,
they will never get that chance ,
super .
that kind of positive visibility is gold .
and i 'm going to suggest one
uh , yeah . i 'm out .
what ?
we 're a hospital .
well , then why would you propose cutting it ?
it 's bringing in the patients .
you have surgical interns in there doing chest exams .
look , i know these cuts are going to be painful ,
sheldon talks about her all the time .
that is true .
uh , so , ramona , tell us about yourself .
leonard , your wife is sitting right here .
my mother taught me .
and don 't be so modest .
can you believe that on fridays ,
it 's bald on one side now !
we 'll just comb over some branches !
she was going to ,
i see .
that you picked a good color ...
you don 't have to entertain her .
ah , these used to be glorita 's favorite !
can 't just let ' em go , joseph .
you can 't run this like the store .
all things come second when we 're on a specified walk .
hey , it was a good follow , though .
it 's definitely going into the book .
it 's an internet guy .
thats all he does ? he seasons meat ?
why don 't we save the next walk for the day after tomorrow ?
okay . fine .
i try to come once every week .
he 's changed over the years .
it 's hard to see .
i 'm not saying he did good things .
those poor people didn 't deserve to die like that .
ain 't we all doing that ?
they keep him heavily sedated .
he 's too smart for ' em .
he 's good thinking through things .
it is actually the center of my work .
you don 't let them get you down , elijah .
stay proud .
you 're keeping him here without guards ?
the individual who came with you is contained .
you were the sole survivor of a devastating train derailment
look at you , david .
you can 't possibly explain everything away .
i 'm a professor of cinema .
and i have absolutely no idea what i 'm doing here .
daryl , who takes over at 11 : 00 p.m. ,
couple that with the fact that i 've overheard complaints
someone has been pretending .
your son is trying to best his dad .
he 's the brains . he 's the reluctant hero .
comic books are not valid history .
uh , the beast is saying that he 'd like you
if that fails , use the machine .
maintaining balance .
we 're not here to buy umbrellas ,
we 're flying you down to headquarters .
she was abandoned in a box for years .
mum , can i bring my toys ? :
i expect they 'll be asking the inn keeper to use the telephone any minute now .
oul car is a flat .
it 's ox , jessie , you 'll be safe now .
i 'm just saying it 's quite common in these types of movies
maybe this place is haunted .
of course not . everybody knows ghosts aren 't real .
highly unlikely .
we need break into groups of two .
anything goes wrong , give a yell .
ew , i stepped in something
keep it together , man !
we will get out all right , in boxes .
jessie , nobody is getting boxed up .
xou have a sale .
ah-u , it 's hard to make out .
let 's see what 's next to go .
you 're not gonna believe this .
like taking candy from a baby .
i can 't believe we 're never gonna see bonnie again .
well find a way , carl .
hey , you better hurry , soldier .
you have a sale .
all right . come on , big money
oh , my god , he 's getting up .
looks like you get to go on a little trip .
ok , he 's gone !
i 'll go get woody .
you 're gonna get in the box .
back through that door and take the other boxes .
it 's the only way to free woody .
i can 't get in a box . i can 't !
this is the way .
why ?
along with , uh , sniffing , snorting , injecting ,
nothing . you bastard
when jean luc died , we were afraid that .
oh , i 'm sorry . i know how close you two were .
hey , eat .
sweeney ! you just received one of the best compliments i 've ever heard .
conti told me you 're going for the third star .
in paris , they say we are " old school "
we 're good ?
mr. jones , your credit card has been denied .
that 's okay . i 'm friends with tony balerdi .
tuck
you marinate the lamb in za 'atar and lemon zest , right ?
keep eating
you leaving me a note to meet you at a burger king .
no , this place is easy , accessible , and cheap . it 's easy to find .
mmm . you want some lunch ?
why not ?
you don 't like people on minimum wage ?
you know why people like you don 't like fast food ?
because it 's food for the working class .
justify why it costs $ 500 more
and consistency is death .
no , a chef should strive to be consistent in experience
adam jones . my god .
closed down any , uh , good restaurants ately ?
my reviews close bad ones .
i 'm back , and i 'm gonna cook like we did in the old days ,
how do you to plan to maintain your sobriety ?
the power of prayer .
i run a group here on tuesdays and thursdays at 10 : 00 .
i don 't make sandwiches
oh , i 've been myself since the ' 90s .
well , that question indicates a serious lack of research .
that 's how i want my chefs to be .
do we have a problem ?
you 're an addict . so it 's not alcohol now
doomed middle age really isn 't .
reece , in truth , the lobster was good .
but you fucked up the sauce with too much lemon juice .
absolutely not
i don 't do groups . so what do you think ,
my french is rusty , but , uh , i think technically it 's a death threat .
i 'm sure he 's very .... busy , it being opening night .
come on ! what the fuck is this bullshit !
what did i say ? did i make a mistake this morning
carrots ! carrots ! carrots ! carrots !
what the fuck is this ? you don 't give me a plate ? !
you 're handing me a plate with nothing on it ?
i said 40 seconds with a warm ingredient .
when you 're ready to cook , let me know , i 'll be right here .
outside . throwing up .
and i 'm gonna write to each and every one of them and apologize ..
my fuckin ' fault .
yes , chef .
did you think that was a joke ?
did you measure your potato slices ?
there 's no time . you just have to know .
my fault
we were backing up , chef .
then you throw it away .
no matter what .
eat it .
now spit it out before you die of " who gives a fuck " scallop .
do you ever take a chance ? do you ever take a chance in your life ?
you don 't get to talk back . that wasn 't a fucking question .
you 're a piece of a equipment .
.. " whatever you want , chef , right away , chef , "
you 're a fucking poison , you know that ?
don 't ever fucking touch me again .
everybody get the fuck out now !

sandy 's behavior before they left home made him uneasy ,

new burlington , indiana .
this photo really meant something to him .
dark hair , not bad looking . quiet .
i don 't know .
look , kid ...
he just went off to the shoe factory one morning and never came back .
some people were born just so they could be buried .
his father would have done anything to save her .
anything .
and suddenly he realized , standing in his father 's church ,

goddamn bird scared me .
and i know that you don 't wanna hurt me !
okay .
remember that night you brought me up here ?

i 'd had two really bad experiences in the youith cup .
played as a first-year apprentice , and got knocked out in the semi-final .
the football was so good , i think . it was just so enjoyable to play in that .
and here 's ben thornley . could go it all alone !
switzer trying to get in behind and there are people in the middle
didn 't go in , but he got so excited about it .
you , ust knew
i 'm happy that us lot came through at that time ,
and it stopped .
for me , that 's my best moment at the cliff .
and all that , come and watch your team play ,

said , " sharpey ! " sharpey 's in the mirror , just
he 's in his bedroom just , you know , putting his jacket on .
his bedroom just , you ' know , putting his jacket on .
this time , the apprentices can hear his voice ,
one of them jumped out the window .
and he didn 't know. about them . they didn 't get caught .
nd he 's usj sat us down and he 's absolutely battered us .
he had this grace about him .
and lee dixon went for one , martin keown went for one .
i 'm thinking scholes is coming in back post .
it is the best goal i 've ever seen .
as a defender , you look at those lads differently ,
every single one of them .
you needed a result , but you didn 't need extra time ,
lit could all blow up in my face at the end of the day ,
the players will be talking about that for years .
trying to reach peaks and climaxes to our season ,
now we go and try and win this league now .
have you ever seen the footage when ,
watch the footage of scholesyes
i 've never seen it .
it 's simple , then to have the manager who gives them the chance to play .
obviously us , but the team in general ,
nd then six days later we lost the fa cup ,
but to be real lis ti

cause i didn 't know whether it was going to be all right or not , you know ?

i always try and hit someone on the back of the head .
h lot intentionally
and now and again he 'd obviously hit you . more often than not , actually .
we weren 't getting our crosses in . i wasn 't overlapping
things that we 'd done all year .. the moment
we made a couple of changes .
and all of a sudden i thought , " here we go . "
but maybe that was god 's way of saying this is nicky buit 's moment .
he was immense . i was there .
gorton , there you go .
you know what i mean ?
and with people like becks on the pitch to put balls in like tl
manchester united teams under sir alex ferguson always went to the end .
i don 't remember the final whistle , to be honest with you .
history is made .
" what has just happened here ? "
let 's move .
all right . go , go , go . let 's move . go .
i asked her marry me , and a truck came outta nowhere .
i 've been benched .
he wants the best for torres .
they 're not thinking about you . they 're thinking about torres .
what 's her status ?
i promise you . we 're gonna make a plan ,
you 're gonna be okay .
she needs bypass to fix it , and she needs it now .
which is why we should wait to repair the heart .
no , damage control ...
look , yelling at each other is not .
i take it back .
if there 's a baby to godmother .
callie .
but we 're going to lower your sedation
can you follow me with your eyes ?
can you squeeze my hand ?

she didn 't respond ?
look , it 's just too soon to tell .
anything else ?
these are dr. burke 's ex-patients .

it 's the heparin .
it 'll work . i know it will .

i 've been assigned to mrs. santiago 's case
except inside that house .
it crosses over into several categories of mental illness :
based on my interviews with her and her children ,
keeping things that are important to her ,
well , if that were the case ,
so it wasn 't about restraining him .
case file did mention something
i gotta tell you , man , this place is disgusting .
it 's what created it .
you can be traumatized
you know , i 'm starting to think this whole hoarding thing s
you know , someone
what 's her deal ?
well , unless she married young ,

is hoarding people part of hoarding ?
the damage inflicted on others is more

what nick means is that
ryan hoff went missing from the halfway house 17 months ago .
derrick kennedy , ten months ago .
six months ago , that 's the last time
but maybe it didn 't compromise the source .
is it wrong this place is starting to feel like home ?
yes , dr. prescott and i are with you now .
the last time i was in the house ,
okay . which dresser ?

not if you take into account " churning . "
yeah , maybe .
people are raising their tray tables and putting their seat-backs in an upright position
at least these trains have modern plumbing .
he is referring , of course ,
holy crap ! look !
" no , summer , don 't kill me ! i 'm pro-robot ! ahh ! "

that 's it .
why do you get first crack , at her ?

you forgot your flash drive .
it 's hot in here .
so ... where you gals headed ?

this is the time to apply .
and also ' cause they 're jewish .
you know what ? you 're right .
let 's go get that loan .
hello , ladies . welcome to rodney .

caroline 's losing her hair , isn 't she ?

wow , even your pillowcase had an edge .
it was kinda like the end of your new pjs .
oh , my god !
max ! no !
rod stewart just busted us .
the big deal is that max thinks she needs these pills
she has to rub it .
but my aunt threw it away .
it was my cousin nora .

you have a good one , too ... mrs. tucker .
why does he wear those boxy jeans ? i don 't know .

how i would love to go to the desert for a night alone .
if you want to go alone , go alone . i don 't care .
because that 's how much i don 't care .
cam , don 't be hurt . i 'm not running from you .
and i 'm not folding that .
it seemed like a good night to do it .
you know , i don 't love the implication
you didn 't not say that .
well , to show you how not needy i am ,
oh , yeah , well , this is the third time
oh , hello , claire .
look ! it even made my teeth whiter , huh ?
here i was beating myself up because i couldn 't be alone ,
ah , yes , sir ?
nobody keeps me on edge for 500 pages
yes , exactly .
you did .
well , at least the steak was good , right ?
terrific wine .
my mum taught me how to hold a rifle when i was 10 .
i have to do what i have to do to get ahead in life .
i 'm freshman cadet .
i think it 's hard , but too severe ?
if anything , it 's not severe enough ,
it 's training for life .
i 'm starting to think that we could sort these things out
what do i think of the insurrectionists ?
you don 't kill people who aren 't even fighting .
civilians where i lived really had to learn how to protect themselves .
i 'm responsible for them .
i 'm proud to do things the corbulo way , the unsc way .
in that sense , i feel like i fit in great .
my brother always thought i 'd be a good soldier .
you need a clear head ,
yeah , i 'd be able to kill .
i don 't really feel like i 'm ready to go into battle .
mayday , mayday .
is anyone listening ?
that doesn 't mean .
for over four years , all i have done is think .
what are you dreaming in there ?
" i. "
had this been a real firefight ,
understood , sir !
lead them on tour , orenski !
the coms are messed up ,
they 've got secrets .
hey , ease up , gingerbread .
my combat scores suck because of you .
come on , i swear ! i 'll tell him . i 'll tell him .
so we make a drop into the rainforest a couple weeks ago .
rich warns us all not to drink the water .
of course , the first thing i do is to get a mouthful .
ha ha ! volcano !
the pincer movement .
this is an actual strategy ?
the romans outnumbered hannibal 's troops by over 10,000 strong ,
hubris .
never underestimate what they 'll sacrifice for victory .
yeah , how do we apply this ?
true , we don 't , but what do we have instead ?
lasky ?
you passed out during the training exercise .
turns out the cryo blisters and your difficulty breathing
it occurs in about one in every 50,000 or so .
the intensity of your allergy is still undetermined .
i want you to take it real easy the rest of the day today .
thanks .
i 'm on andesia . it 's a jump away from home .
mom would be proud .
we 're doing a good thing .
you remember rich from back home .
he wasn 't .
i had to shave it all off for rich .
anyways , uh ..
i can 't wait to get home .
guys , look , you 're missing the point .
why would we protect the enemy ?
colonel mehaffey would like to see you .
my chest burns , sir , quite a bit .
seems like you have a choice to make , thomas .
it appears dr. hughes ' test has revealed
when would i leave ?
you know , thomas ,
you have to decide what you 're willing to sacrifice .
thomas , it is with a heavy heart that i must inform you
i 've been told it was a quick and painless death .
with this in mind , i have decided that you
lasky ?
now 's not a good time , sully , okay ?
now what the hell is that ?
i 'm screwed , man . it 's oni .
i got to talk to dimah .
it 's a whole new war .
it 's invisible .
one of the things is inside , and it is invisible .
no , no , no , screw that ! we stay here !
no , no , no , we 're gonna go to the training room .
and maybe you feel like you 're like them .
you live in another world entirely .
but if you truly wanna go join them ,
i guarantee it 's all there ,
how old are you ?
oh . it is a little cold in here .
ill have somebody look into that right away .
oh , everywhere else i go ,
but london just sort of slaps on another coat of paint .
oh , no , i like it .
call me if you need anything .
it 's beside the schedule .
i really do appreciate it .
see you tomorrow .
who wants to hear the trolley song
i 'll go and check .
we could have a drink if you like .
well , your television interview 's all confirmed .
no , i beg to differ .
really ? do tell .
when i was 11 ,
what if this people magazine thing is the best rai is ever going to achieve ?
come on .
sheldon ..
boy , we 've got to get you into a better office .
really , you don 't have to go to any trouble .
he gets a new office , i can 't even get
let me ask you something .
science
i have a master 's degree .
dr. koothrappali , have you ever had lunch
it 's the same food as the cafeteria , only fresh .
okay , big buddy .
you can stop smiling now .
have any of you boys ever been to a photo shoot ?
it 's fantastic .
they say it 's the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent .
excuse me .
go for koothrappali .
have we at this point met our social obligations ?
okay , just put it on my calendar ,
you might want to drink this one slowly .
gee , i 'd love to , raj , butl can 't make it .
no , i could ... . no .
i can make it. but i won 't .
rai is celebrating a tremendous accomplishment
that would be cool .
come on , this is huge .
would you like to go with me ?
i would be honored .
look at that , i got a date with penny .
now .
yeah , call me when you 're on the cover .
it was in the limo. they sent a limo .
that 's what you 're wearing ?
nothing . i was just hoping for something a little more ,
it 's not a date , and that 's racist .
he 's a beloved character on the simpsons .
with any luck , tonight will be the night my sleep apnea kills me .
even though the menu description specifies " shredded " ?
yes. did you stop at the korean grocery
just sit down and eat .
all right , it 's shredded. what do you want me to do ?
sorry .
sheldon , don 't take this the wrong way , but you 're insane .
for the record , it could kill us to meet new people .
and i 'm not insane. my mother had me tested .
look , she has a constitutional right to visitation .
can you argue self-defense ?
anything that might help her is out of frame .
you telling me you can 't get your hands on any cash ?
.. considering you was gonna kill me not too long ago .

location ....
okay , so tell tom the secret of your risotto .
oh , no , no , i 'm gonna hang on to these .
ma 'am , we can 't charge him without evidence , and if he walks ,
but guard them with your life .
we 've been open for three months now , and we 've barely turned a profit !
yeah , i think we should use ' em all the time .
so come on.eat .
if we serve this for tomorrow 's special , will will clear 4 grand .
mother , no ! he 's the best cow in the world !
we 've no food or money and no choice but to sell her .
ool at her !
the beams
that your family tree would always be
your father was no father
now there 's no more fuss and there 's no more scenes
but that 's cheating .
i 'll need a certain potion first .
one , the cow as white as milk .
three , the hair as yellow as corn .
bring me these
bring them and i guarantee
now may i go to the festival ?
darling , those nails darling , those clothes
look at that flesh fink and plump
mother said not to stray
get it , get it , get it , get it !
you go up to the little thing , and you take it !
why don 't you take it ?
why do you think i asked you to do it in the first place ?
get me what i need !
hello , mr. baker .
ate all the sweets and half a loaf of bread
give it back !
now off you go to granny 's ,
this is hopeless !
oh , wait , is it a golden slipper and a yellow cow ?
wait a minute , i never thanked you !
i 'm sorry .
mother said , " straight ahead " not to delay or be misled
here
thank you !
what sort of boy exchanges a cow for beans ?
get your head out of the clouds , jack !
go on , get in there !
to bed without supper for you !
the first night of the festival ball
that way !
i must find that girl .
i just need to catch my breath .
were you at the king 's festival ?
cow 's gone ! get it back ! get it back !
get away from me with that , you fool !
by midnight tomorrow bring me the items ,
did i abuse her ' or show her disdain ?
if i should lose her how shall i regain
am i not sensitive
the girl must be mad
do you mean you 're going to let me stay with you ?
you 've changed you 're daring
i know we 'll get past the woods
i 've missed you so much !
from the giant 's hen .
and you can have it , along with the five gold pieces .
i could !
i 'm not a liar . i 'll get that harp , you 'll see !
bring back my harp !
jack is just a lad !
the boy ! i want the boy !
i 'm waiting !
you must be quiet !
let us not anger the giant !
let 's not anger the giant .
i 'm gonna get my boy and hide him so you 'll never find him !
get back , woman !
no , no , this isn 't an earthquake .
then i 'm sure the prince will see to it that the giant is rid from our land .
no doubt he 's off somewhere seducing some young maiden .
you look like the princess , but dirty .
no , no . please , get up . i 'm not a princess here .
if you 'd like , you could come with me .
thank you .
we decided to walk 500 paces in one direction
how brave you are to be alone in the woods .
what was that ?
did a prince really kiss me ?
and did i kiss him back
back to life , back to sense back to child , back to husband
either plain or grand ?
thac 's what woods are for
listen to the roar giants by the score
maybe i shouldn 't have stolen from the giant .
maybe i shouldn 't have attended the ball .
where are you going ?
but you said we had to find our way out of this together .
we need your help .
i depended on my wife for everything !
you would leave your child ?
if you love me , why did you stray ?
i was raised to be charming , not sincere .
is that what you really wish ?
well , i 'm glad that we hashed all that out ,
we 're the best team .
very good to see you .
uh , kevin , this is barry kripke . we went to college together .
we should hit up the buffet at the strip club
you can come , too .
i 'll walk you out .
you 're the best !
that 's strange : you seem quite fond of him .
how do i know you 're not just being polite
why do you say he 's a weasel ?
was to take other people 's ideas and turn them in as his own .
i 'm not surprised . i heard the only work he did on his thesis
you 'd do that for us ?
i also don 't want to see you win a nobel .
i don 't know , barry . it sounds a little sleazy .
sleazy is where i thrive .
really ? what 'd she say ?
so couldn 't we just bring down our wrath
and ?
oh , good , you 're all here . uh , we 're wrestling
yeah . fire away .
quick question : does it happen to do with online tastes
it goes on our credit card .
kripke says he plagiarized his thesis ,
hang on . i don 't think it 's fair to use something
i don 't know . if someone 's a cheater ,
so you really think they should do this ?
okay . okay , well , well , let 's see .
wait .
uh , because she had a type .
not just their names .
your husband was acting kind of weird today .
no . he was acting all sketchy .
oh . well , that doesn 't mean anything .
i 'm so okay , yeah .
okay , look , leonard knows
why did you tell me ?
but you wanted me to .
i wanted to be a princess .
apparently , i 'm the light of your life .
well , now that i know there 's a thing to know , i have to know .
that 's not a real thing .
leonard , i know what you 're planning to do ,
well , you told me .
you 're not doing anything wrong .
yeah , but it 's still wrong .
and if that means i have to do something shady
i mean , it 's sweet that you want to help , but we don 't want you
i thought we were just worried about looking bad .
okay .
listen , i did something kind of stupid today .
i went to the cheesecake factory
don 't worry . i didn 't find out ,
and why should i need to be validated by another woman
the restaurant manager already called .
and i regret that .
well , you 're off to a good start .
no problem .
we didn 't say we were going to buy you lunch .
this isn 't another apology .
yes .
i 've got wounded , colonel . we can talk politics later .
get him to deacon unit with the rest of his team .
yes , sir , colonel .
someone you don ' ! know .
taking from you our only birthright
medical says they 've never seen anything like it .
what the hell did they do to us ?
talk to me , medic .
they 're coming in from further and further from the blast site .
population of this ward
you 're saying they got their hands on a compound
an element . closest they can pin it is the 120 family .
this thing randomly compromises human dna , but not others .
way of wiping us out without firing a shot .
question is , why sedra ? why use this on an outer colony ?
test run , probably .
he says he 's only a middleman .
but he did anyhow .
he says it 's sourced from hell .
so they buy from someone who will .
intense red giant .
piece of the halo ring .
exactly .
this one apparently ends up in our red giant 's orbit .
treaty says no one goes back to the ring . not unsc , not covenant .
problem is ' there 's no record of an element like that on the halo ring .
after , it could be a different story .
display object 's composition .
cross-reference other planets , celestial bodies with this element .
galaxies , known universe .
an element fatal to humans .
ninety-six sauare kilometers . we could nuke it .
hold up on that .
another inbound
we don 't have a lot of time , admiral .
one day , he up and walks away .
it 's not supposed to be possible
scars like they took a bunch of titanium out of his body .
how 's that come to pass ?
colonel , i 've got ' em . running east of you .
you have no idea what you 're doing !
not bad for advisers , huh , colonel ?
yes , sir !
pull up , sir ! pull up !
i don 't know . but pull up !
we were cloaked . how did they know ?
it 's like a magnet to them .
once they on you , they can even sense your movements .
you call them hunter worms , we call them lekgolo .
they don 't respond 10 it well .
so reliant on their technology ,
my ankle is broken .
none of these units have an ex-orbital comm .
as of this moment , none of us are getting off this stone .
that 's not true .
it 's a two-seater .
some of us aren 't going to survive the night .
doesn 't mean we can 't get the mission done beforehand , though .
we got them .
make sure what happened back there on sedra never happens again .
ow do we decide who takes it ?
down there to the left .
plants , water . what the hell is this ?
could be a million things .
we 're losing momentum .
but they can 't make the muscle movement .
we gotta get out of this hole . we don 't have time .
then why don 't you leave me here ?
maybe the hunters are none the wiser .
everything 's chances now .
come on , man .
as we planned
anyone who wants to go after them , they can .
wouldn 't make it 200 yards .
hurry up !
shut up .
me , he needs to y the ship . you , what 's he need ' ?
because i trust you more than him .
if you 're interested , i also know all about frying meat
football or chicken-fried meats ?
i 'm going to penny 's on saturday
come on , sheldon , please teach me about football .
i 'm sorry .
the taiwanese government has released a statement
tension in the area has increased
numerous small arms and rocket attacks continue to be reported .
orange , are you happier this year than you were last ?
aid there 's talk of war with china
orange , tell me you 're a machine ,
orange , which smells better .
donkey ass ? what ? can you repeat that ?
donkey ass ? you 're not making any sense at all .
test subjects must keep wounds clean at all times .
please report any infections to a medical center .
please . listen to me . they 've got my son .
there was no body . why did they lie to me ?
what do you really do in there ?
let go of her .
look , i felt sorry for her , too ,
he died two years ago in the port of houlong .
well , some people can 't give up hope .
still , they shouldn 't treat her like that .
anyway , look , you want to get a coffee ?
clever bugger , isn 't he ?
vincent 's told us all how talented you are .
after all , vincent 's no slouch .
i spent an entire semester
odd for a 19-year-old to pass on such an honor .
so nothing to do with your politics then ?
but indistinguishable from human skin to the touch .
we 're having trouble getting the skin to take the dye .
so you want the machine soldier to look human ?
we already have plenty of machines that can kill ,
all we 'll need to do is give it a new skin job ..
how are you finding the new model , james ?
this is what i miss the most .. the feel of another human ,
i .. i actually don 't think that 's a good idea .
when did they take him in ? half past 7 : 00 .
do you think they can remember who they are ?
how can you trust something that doesn 't fear ..
it 's not programming . it taught itself .
i don 't want to see you get in trouble .
sorry to interrupt .
i fooled them . they thought i was human .
well , why didn 't i think of that ?
if you hate this place so much , why have you stayed for so long ?
my research is too important to me .
i hoped a brain implant would help her .
girls are genetically
glad we gave it tits then .
all right , that 's enough . take that bloody thing off it 's head .
they 're human .
but how do you know that ?
apart from their flesh ,
yes . yes . everything 's fine , thank you .
yes . yes , i am sure .
well , don 't work too hard .
you know me , don 't you ? my name 's thomson .
it 's full of skills that you 'll need .
and install all of the programs .
i can speak different languages .
that man killed your mother .
why would you let him go ?
that 's the law .
how would you stop him ?
well , he doesn 't care if you shout .
yes , but that 's not going to stop him , though , is it ?
you know that . don 't you ?
but i need proof .
i would trust you with my life .
vincent , it 's time for you to come in .
what was ? vincent said
that doesn 't make any sense . how can you remove the g.p.s. ?
test room .
security teams are engaged .
their language is mostly transmitted thoughts .
why didn 't they tell us ?
where are you going ?
that 's my mom .
always there to snap us back to reality .
come on .
finally old enough to sign up for the fight .
i can 't let you do this , dad . this is my fight .
it was supposed to be me .
london 's not going to war , right ?
why can 't we stay together ?
i don 't want you to go .
you have nothing to blame yourself about .
all right .
we shouldn 't use that word
mom !
i will make sure freddy makes things right .
you know what ? let 's just keep an eye on you .
i will , however , suggest
little boy .
come on , get up .
he really blew a fuse about his car .
this ain 't time to be spending money like that .
dad 's been eyeing these boots for a long time , hasn 't he ?
thank you .
does this mean your father 's coming back ?
good morning , mrs. busbee .
his platoon was sent to secure malabang
after years of internment , the army , in its wisdom ,
well , i for one , remember pearl harbor ,
you forgot the onions , hashimoto .
i 'm getting sick and tired of hearing again and again and again
and they did it in the most cowardly way you can imagine .
if i could , i would smash every tap with my bare hands
here you go . have at him .
there he is !
i guess that was stupid of me .
again .
no , you moved it .
see , i moved it because
at least some of the time .
in theory , yes .
the ist , the ancient ist .
this is what you have to do .
how is that supposed to .
in order to make this list work for you ,
i 'm sorry about the other day .
yeah . how can anyone be friends with a jap ?
hey , jap .
and all he did was throw it in the trash .
yep . just get to know him .
i just don 't see how this helps anyone .
jeez . just tell the kid to stop .
the will to face one 's fear
measure yourself from here to the sky .
hey , freddy .
look . someone 's giving you the stink eye .
maybe this . it 's a magic list , right ?
do you have hot dogs in japan , mr. hashimoto ?
it 's been 42 years since i 've been in japan .
and do you still have relatives over there ?
takeshi and koji .
the war changed everything
and did they send you away to the camps ?
no , no , mrs. busbee , it 's okay .
i have the face of the enemy .
doesn 't matter if i love this land , this country ...
london , what are you doing ? put that down right now .
london , think about your dad .
london , think about what you 're doing
get out now .
get out !
this is all your fault !
listen to me . if i see you hanging out with that rat ,
stop what ? stop an eight-year-old boy
nothing
mom , i 'm just trying to be prepared .
look at that .
they need crap like this to believe that there 's something bigger than them .
i 've been walking to work for 35 years
eather oliver ?
no , a boy moved a mountain .
i figured it out !
today is me and your dad 's wedding anniversary .
what 's little boy doing ?
with dynamite .
much of life is a gamble , ollie .
so tell me , ollie .
then my " imaginary friend "
if he doesn 't , could lose faith in himself
i mean , not like our wedding beautiful .
amy , i don 't understand , are we broken up or not ?
it 's because you 're not giving me any space to think .
you know what , sheldon , you 've made this really easy .
i don 't need any more time to think . we 're broken up .
will someone take me home ?
we-we were both drunk , and she smelled like an ashtray .
did you feel guilty ?
did you feel guilty after kissing her ?
i feel guilty every time i see her .
what ... do i mean ?
please . i 'm begging you .
you 're doing the right thing .
preparing for level two extraction .
there is no universe in which you and i could be anything .
a great man , huh
he is a visionary .
he 's had to make choices and take action that you could never comprehend .
of course not . i 'm ...
oh , no .
i 'll do anything .
i think we have a problem .
i went straight to the police and i told them what i saw .
well , he flew back to nyc .
i 'm the only living witness to any of his crimes .
okay . you ready ?

we were in syria .
the sniper was using him as bait , trying to lure us out
i saw him there ..

i could hurt him .
i don 't have much time
you 're so pretty .

so , you 've just gotta keep living , man .
you 've just gotta keep living life .
let 's all turn to page 49 .
you 're right . stay away from the liberal arts .

the teachers union .
she wrote back .
this is the sort of weird fact i find myself recalling
i turn to other people 's words , too . "
like a lady .
" what they really want ... "
would you like to weigh in or are you just gonna scream throughout the meal ?
mom !
or we could go to your place ?
where were you born ?

it 's symptomatic . here , look at my purse .
it 's too late for a purse smackdown .
should i just put the cheese plate out for the irs now ?
i bought some of those curly light bulbs once .
sorry , max , i can 't stop myself .
if we were at a copper-plated jewelry sale ,
that ... .
you like that , throwing murphy on my service ?
now you understand that it 's in both of our interests
his wife was on a stripper pole and fell on him
so why don 't you get mr. olsen 's past medical history
your face ?
we could buy a house .
we could buy another house .
we could buy the team to play on the football field .
well , we 'd buy another team .
mo ' money , mo ' problems .
james was born with crouzon syndrome ,

oh , you 're right .
same way i remember it .
oh , making something turn blue in a tube , that 's for us ?
perhaps i could use a bite .
wait up .
i presume this is the young man of whom you spoke ?
grandfather told me all about it .
very efficient , though .
it 's a bit chilling
looks rather effeminate , don 't you think ?
where is he now
that door leads to your bath .
and you also have this for your amusement .
of course . i know that .
see for yourself .
the one on the wall plaque ?
well , he was trained by the league of assassins .

bad enough you 've given yourself away
every day .
you can 't fight crime by becoming a criminal .
we searched his place , nothing much there .
hey .
it 's a phone se .

sometimes afterward , we 'd go to the amusement park .

ii was up to my old experiments .
he wanted you to make the ultimate warriors .

it 's not a molar pregnancy , is it ?
who the hell are you , and what are your credentials ?
who the hell are you ?
oh , uh , that 's , a-a ..
lesbian lover , baby daddy .
oh , well , it 's probably too early for that .
just take it easy for the next few days ,
uh , call me if the bleeding gets worse or if there 's pain .
martha elkin , 75 , multi-vessel coronary disease ,
that 's just doctor speak for a quadruple bypass .
pre-op labs and her x-rays were normal .
my husband went down for some coffee .
oh , martha , it 's hard to tell .
uh , but we 'll keep him posted .
oh , that 's helpful , dear . he 'll be glad to know that .
i can live with being a part-time wife .
so ...
give him the drug .
day one and this thing already blows .
well , you 're the one who wanted in on the trial of the century .
well , about five years ago , i was visiting my mother .
so i realize that she thinks
i couldn 't cure her alzheimer 's ,
oh , you may want to put all that away . mrs. elkin .
i think you mean " tweets , " sir .
no , no , not whatever .
uh , let me try .
i told her i 'd look into it ,
it might be a good way to reach students .
this thing isn 't designed for medicine .
for now . i mean , look at gps .
you know , you go out , you never have to get lost again .
we 'll just save that conversation for next time .
it looks like she 's tweeting a surgery right now .
she won 't say anything .
well , what did you do ?
we 're both on the same surgery .
i want owen .
what the hell ...
owen 's at the dentist . he 'll be hard to find .
he started it .
the highest resolution there is .

uh , anyway she would take the , uh , messed up pancreas ...
check the flow on the graft .

max , do you want to be my maid of honor ?
which would take a long time and be a lot less embarrassing .
that 's right . i don 't .
sophie , as honored as i am that you asked ,
it 's nobody 's thing .
thank god i 'm off the list ,
and then she was my maid of honor
i 'm gonna go home and find out
it 's already too crowded in here
oh , i know !
that 's your solution to everything .
we need to just take some to that new bar
and also , the special skills i 've listed on my resume .
yeah , we 're there .
can you , like , do this for me , just , like , once ?
i haven 't heard i 'm beautiful
hey , can i kiss you ?
i 'm wet .

it was insane . i mean , like , so hot .
what are you two celebrating ?
we are celebrating the release of the new :
you know , i won my yacht club talent show
where are my manners ?
but you can call us by our gang names ,
i mean , that 's a tough call .
yeah , it 's really not my thing .
i get it . i deserved that .
like the old saying . " tit for bigger tat . "
uh , i would bail my maid of honor out of jail .
i 'll be your maid of honor .
yeah ! and the penis-shaped pasta ?
i hear you 're a man to watch .
you don 't come to congress meetings .
well , do you know anything about us ?
if you went out today and said , " follow me , "
when i am better qualified
see , this is the official method of establishing racial type .
i am a black man .
the pencil stays in your hair .
always works .
yeah , yeah , it 's you that i want to see !
and what else did you find out ?
it 's just here .
what time do you finish ?
did you see a weapon ? you find that weapon , pienaar .
police killed 69 africans in the township of .
tragic consequence of the desperate endeavor
we no longer accept the authority of a state
i 'm going underground .
nonviolent .
when the acid reaches the mixture , it catalyzes ..
they 're calling me a terrorist .
now , find a foreign journalist .
i want the world to know .
we have been forced into an armed struggle .
brian widlake .
for 50 years , we have been talking peace and nonviolence .
if you were us , what would you do ?
i want freedom .
hey , it 's daddy .
it 's ok .
look , it 's daddy .
do you want to come run with dad ?
i 've lost the new job , though .
no . i 'll be all right .
fight them .
what happened ?
i 'm so sorry , madiba .
time for you to move on .
police !
run , run !
get down on the floor !
before the judge imposes the supreme penalty ,
that won 't help your appeal .
no appeal ?
i have reached my verdict .
the accused are all found guilty as charged .
in essence , they have courted martyrdom
i have therefore decided not to impose the supreme penalty .
in a line .
move , move , get over there .
all right , listen to us .
indians get trousers . indians get socks .
sit down , sit down , man !
move ! move , move , move !
no problem .
let 's work , boys .
every time they make us angry , it 's like they win .
never .
but don 't worry .
the girls send their love .
i think of them every day .
it 's not been easy on the boy .
most dangerous men in africa .
wild animals , the lot of you .
i see myself more like a lion .
no tigers in africa , madiba .
no , it 's a fact , there have never been tigers .
what kind of a lawyer is a tiger ?
they 're killing us on the streets .
what is your name ?
mr. lekota , we have been in prison for a very long time .
aye , aye , brave man .
so , did brent do well in his examination ?
it must be his 14th birthday soon .
do you ever forget anything ?
these are the same people
you are right .
how can we ever allow you to have any real power ?
i have seen what fear has done to your people .
now consider our position .
make them suffer as we suffer .
i think we 're going to make progress .
i believe you will soon be reaching your 70th birthday .
do you plan a celebration ?
is this my new prison ?
who else is to be held here ?
ah , mr. mandela , welcome to your new home .
no , you have a vital job to do for your country .
by the way ,
you are hungry .
i know that it has been tough for you , but ..
these boys that you have around you .
well , the violence , for one .
is that for me ?
so you are doing that because of the color of their skin ?
that is what they do to us , and we must do better .
swart , you can stop .
yes , but she won 't . this is still a prison .
maybe .
well , i was married in 1958 ,
i 've seen you with her and the way you look at her photograph .
a car will be ready at 9 : 00
i don 't want you at my side at that moment .
just open the gate
loyalty , winnie mandela .
i have decided that it would be better if i live in my own home .
better for us
am i to blame because i don 't want to be alone ?
we have both been alone too much , winnie .
why , why do you show me this ?
this has gone too far .
i have accepted the situation !
it 's the logical fallacy of extending someone 's argument to ridiculous proportions
i 'll get you a blanket and a pillow .
i use the bathroom from 7 : 00 to 7 : 20 .
i do not .
well , then it 's all settled .
although at this point , it 's more like doctor why bother ?
wolowitz is with his new girlfriend .
have you seen penny eat chinese food ?
we don 't order egg rolls .
can we please make a decision ?
there 's an idea . why don 't we just go out for indian food ?
tell you what i 'm going to do .
when i 'm walking over to the table ,
i 'll know .
yeah , we can always divide soup .
sheldon , remember , we role-played this .
all right , fellas i gotta go .
maybe we should 've asked if we could go dancing with her and her girlfriend .
your anger is not with me , sir , but with basic mathematics .
what 's happening to us ? we 're falling apart .
the only man who can restore any semblance of balance to our universe .
come here . what on earth do you think you 're doing ?
oh , it 's you .
well , no harm done , eh ?
here .
what 's wrong with the patient you 're visiting ?
try to call in twice a day .
you must be rolling in it .
i treat the whole family for a few shillings a year .
ah , well , rod fixed her up with a wireless .
oh , look , i-i meant to say ,
really ?
oh . oh , but that 's too funny .
i was such an obedient boy as a rule .
they were just asking to be vandalized .
i was overwhelmed by admiration .
mother almost died of shame when she found out .
heavens , no .
we never spoke of it again ,
i forgive you .
that you were here before rod and me .
susan .
and i once smoked a cigarette .
no . but then my mother was very hot on rules .
gillian , look at that beautiful piano .
i 'm so glad you did .
oh , god , is he in a bad way ?
you 're not the only one .
he said he could smell smoke ,
it 's nothing like that .
we must keep it from mother .
i 'm inclined to agree .
why on earth would babb need to knock down a wall ?
didn 't rod say ?
surely you can 't mean to break up the park ?
goddamn .
this is my house ,
what are you doing here ?
you are no one .
i knew you 'd be down , miss ayres .
she puts my foreman to shame .
right , well , come on , then .
here we go .
nights like this , i feel my age .
she 's got hips and she knows what to do with them .
don 't let that stop you .
oh , come on .
do they indeed ?
valerie , darling .
have you been ignoring me ?
shall i light you one ?
no , can 't ! can 't ! can 't !
i thought you wanted to .
wait .
after approximately 15 minutes
positive effects diminished over time .
you should think about staying on .
mmm . so , where did you train ?
then got seconded to a military hospital
caroline , i 've-i 've missed you .
what a bloody idiot you 've made of me .
i won 't do it again .
be no more of this sort of thing ,
i made a pig 's ear of it .
i know the feeling .
i just feel things are out of control .
i was medical officer at a girls ' school for a while .
eventually their mistresses , too .
i don 't know where it will end .
some malevolent force in the house .
i 'm beginning to wonder myself .
we all subscribe to the general principle
detach under sufficient pressure .
acting out all the nasty impulses
oh , god .
oh , no , no . not so fast .
we mean to ask caroline to come
she isn 't all alone .
you 've been very brave today , rod .
she 'll be next .
no , no , no , i , i 've lots to sort out ,
i used to visit quite often , but unfortunately
i 'm afraid i can 't remember your name , doctor .
she totally knows you 're gay .
uh , maybe it 's the way you ordered a drink-a-doodle-doo .
and julia roberts were single ..
it 's not crazy .
no , you handed her a bottle of water .
because you wouldn 't let go .
if by that , you mean lift her off the ground ,
there you go .
you , too . bye !
wham , bam , thank you , cam .
sure did. and all my shirts get ironed ,
america was built with nails , son .
i 'm telling you , you are gonna love this bad boy .
worries
are you kidding me ?
trust me , when you get older , it all changes .
well , life gets in the way .
'cause sometimes i do that .
and you have lots of friends .
it 's not the same as just shouting out
i can 't do this .
because i 've never had any obstacles to overcome .
really ? name one .
see you in september . "
i 've lived a boring , sheltered , pathetic life .
oh , you should be ! it is all your fault !
that essay practically writes itself .
but did you ever consider there 's a reason ?
there 's a reason why we were so easy on you .
oh , honey , you 're old enough now .
the truth .
we 're gonna go for a ride .
you are my mom , right ?
oh , no . what did you eat ?
how can i forget her ?
how could i be so cavalier with her emotions ?
she gave me her number ,
oh , my god . where did you get all this self-confidence ?
people at the time said i could go gerber .
what ?
i have to come clean so she can move on with her life .
first ring .
oh , smooth .
i 'm a gay guy .
as am i , on account of the gay .
no , no . and i want you to sit
no , thank you .
i 'll grill some steaks , open a bottle of wine .
she 's going salsa dancing without me .
a forbidden dance floor . only makes me want it more .
yes , because even though he 's old like you ,
last week i took you to dinner ,
what do you want from me ? i don 't like dancing .
yeah , right .
who doesn 't like the coconut , hmm ? who ?
fine . i hope you have a good time with shorty .
i won 't have any problem finding a partner on my own !
i 'il do it
i said 1'll do it .

could you run this up your shirt
thanks . okay , is that good ? woyep .
he 's going down ! get his head . i got his feet .
i 've got his head . rotate him . look out .
just long enough to talk us into this .
industrials , um , web series .
maybe we shouldn 't be here .
thanks
my whole life has been defined by this place ,
after it all happened , i , um ...
i found him hanging in the garage .
we both lost our families because of this place .
saralh . sarah
we need to watch the rest of those films .
yeah , it looks great .
sure there 's a kmart around .
we lost our family because of this .
okay .
to be released and come back
into my body .
it 's a little cocktail of my own making .
something must have gone wrong .
yeah , they all thought that they were coming back .
this is from the living room mike .
i have been reborn .
this is track two , dining room .
guys , what the fuck was that ?
enough is enough , magvie . let 's get the fuck out of here .
but we just ...
let 's just load up our shit and 90 .
but we 're so close .
ve can 't leave .
but , jim , certainly , the children don 't ..
it means " going home . "
it is a task which requires
a lifetime of devotion is not enough .
sam .
just a spoonful of sugar , children .
i will be your guide .
and when we return to our bodies ,
sam .
children .
don 't put them in your mouth . don 't eat them .
be calm , sister .
she is the flame of life
sarah !
and fear not them which kill the body
there is no joy without suffering .
what is it that we bury in the tomb of the ..
you al will be subsumed !
you all !
that was my dad .
yes , sir .
we 're on it .
i mean , the whole landscape of false vacuums
i sense a disturbance in the force .
so , dennis , how long have you been in america ?
no kidding .
yes .
really ? how old ?
hm , you were the youngest person ever to win it .
this is really delicious , isn 't it ?
oh , sweetie , you are so damaged .
how about a hug for howie ?
something you 'd like to share ?
fifteen years old .
you can 't let this kid get to you .
yes , but i assumed i would 've been dead
i really don 't see what the big deal is .
you 've never excelled at anything .
oh , sure you do .
is that a laser array ?
what happens if you use argon lasers
are you sure ? pretty sure .
sheldon , what are you doing here ?
i 've been in this lab for three years .
well , up until now , i 've had better things to do .
a small payload support structure
when this is done , it will be attached
yeah , okay , it 's a shelf .
did you give any consideration to carbon nanotubes ?
sheldon ,
sheldon ? yes ?
did leonard tell you to say that ?
that can 't be a coincidence .
go away !
you really want karev in charge of all the new kids ?
kepner . kepner .
yes . right .
it 's really only been two nights ?
so , three months ? that means you started walking from ...
were you , uh , walking for charity ?
and then i got hit by a truck .
you did an amazing thing .
it wasn 't anything you did .
they love it when we innovate .
the motorola flip phone ... . that came from star trek .
hey , the future they show in back to the future il
how cool would that be
therefore , the timeline in which 1955 biff gets the almanac
he 's right .
sounds like when you pop open a can of pillsbury dough .
guys ..
do you know if you look at austria on a map
w-we sent the girls away
maybe after this , you 'll be in the mood for some manilow .
hey , penny .. hey , let 's go .
we want to see if they twirl their junk in the other direction .
but i have a little more studying to do .
all right , guys , look , i would love to go out ,
and if you get in trouble , find a policeman .
okay , okay , this is obviously very important to her .
and of self-awareness .
has led to significant advancements in the field of neural engineering
to be more important than the destination .
to develop new methods for the early detection of cancer ...
simply put , to save lives .
and it couldn 't be more relevant than it is today .
to conquer our most intractable challenges .
to heal the planet .
i don 't know anybody who is doing more to make that future a reality ...
please welcome my partner in science and in life
my wife has always been eager to change the world .
can you prove that you are self-aware ?
can you prove that you are ?
ve have no idea how our own consciousness works .
he sent us his research just before he was killed .
and that this works ,
no one is saying that we give up .
both are decades away . this is what we have now .
look at what they did to him .
i 'm worried i 'll miss her .
evelyn
if it were to happen , when it does happen ..
last time you look in those eyes .
dark
it was truly incredible . i 've never felt anything like this .
thoughts are there , but they don 't .
arrive properly .
evelyn .
tl 's incredible
we built this from pinn 's core .
new processor three times more capable than this current system .
i can 't describe it . it 's like my mind has been set free .
i need to access financial markets , educational databases .
no . what are you doing ?
it 's not him . it 's not .
get faster ? more powerful ?
stock footage pinn could have accessed them
i said that i liked the carousel music , some ragtime tune . the next day ...
alright . all i 'm asking is that we 're careful .
you 're not being hacked .
i 've accessed surveillance cameras all over the country .
we can 't stay here , evelyn .
accessing thousands of databases ?
i 've never seen anything like it .
okay .
somewhere its massive appetite for power can be met .
after a while survival won 't be enough .
perhaps the entire world .
one and two are online . six and seven will be on tomorrow
scared the shit out of me .
drake , i got it . come on .
let 's go . ha
i think you 'll be very pleased .
i 'll get dressed .
welcome . we 're glad you 're here .
rift posted a video of martin online .
you mean you let it go viral .
they have no hope .
it 's time for everybody to see .
basically , cut power to every networked hard drive on earth .
and why do we need the terrorists ?
it 's already sideways .
i haven 't handwritten anything since i was at school .
heow did they turn you ?
but you can ?
if those hybrids are networked
brother ? your brother ?
we 're gonna spend them spitting on each other ,
english , fitz , or percy .
and you want us to tell you which one ?
i 'll take it from there .
ok , but what if something happens to you ?
just have a little faith .
we believe lincoln , this tape is a lie .

she deserves better .
then you get what you want .
she 'll tell your kid you tried .
how 'd you get back on the surgery ?
yep . i 'm down to the abdominal wall .
not too good .
it 's probably a can of worms , but ..
let 's have a ... little peek .
bailey . webber , scrub in . fast .
so there 's a hole in the wall ?
and it can 't get to her brain ?
yes . or to her lungs .
they 'll try to , but the heart has to be strong ,
what happens if she dies ?
if your mom dies
you did everything you could .
remember me telling you this .
you recommended that care be withdrawn ?
yes .

you 're a coward , dr . shepherd !
gary , come on .

you 're a kind man , dr. shepherd .
but he 's grieving , and they have no case .
and the kindest thing you can say to him right now is nothing .
it 's over .
it was a pleasure working with you .
i didn 't say anything to her .
i-i miss my dad .
we still have to watch you very closely
you have no choice if you want to survive .

hunt wants you to take a look at her .
uh , yeah , i 'm working on it .
you 've been working on it for a couple of weeks now .
they think it 's stinky .
you should 've called me the minute you talked to the police .
my first concern was keeping her alive .
you didn 't ,
dr. grey . fine . that 's who holly has chosen .
what 's going on ?
i have no psych training .
our job is to break that pattern by letting her know that
we 'll have to work together on this .
thank you . if you 'll excuse me ,
i 'm flattered that she likes me ,
you 'll have a lot more mobility in your elbows .
give me some photo albums and a stuffed animal ,
well , then tell them that i remember all of it ,
and that the only reason i finally ran away
tell them that .
the patient is in good spirits ,
where are her parents ?
it 's not complicated .
frank .
holly 's in a fragile state .
she was brainwashed by him .
possibly .
right now you 're still strangers to her .
did you show her the photo album ?
not even the bunny ? she loved that thing .
i 'm sorry .
it might take some time ,
oh , hey . chief .
have you , uh , have you spoken to him ?
oh , thank goodness .
what do you mean ? he said he thought i was impressive .
she was being kept 5 miles away from their house ,
maybe she could move in with you
are you ready for dinner ?
and ...
impressive .
yeah , well , uh , if this whole surgeon thing doesn 't pan out ,
i think people would pay good money for that ,
we 've been after him for years .
you 're like the freakin ' ritz-carlton of surgery .
because he knows deep down he 's more of a roadside motel .
bold move . she 's gonna have to talk to the soup guy .
for those of us
the therapist and my parents and ...
kicked and raped and slapped and starved .
it was my life .
but you can talk about him .
wherever they are , one of them is bleeding good .
i can 't .
kind of sad really .
we 've got a blanket on all the hospitals .
if they 've got band-aids and bactine ,

your organic line isn 't really organic .

i hope somebody videotaped that " cause that was some crazy shit .
see you , maya .
first , we have to work for his daughter . now we get this one .
he 's competitive to the point of occasional insanity .
you worry about him .
since my mother passed away .
six years and he hasn 't been on a date or a single vacation .
he is always on me about having more of a life outside of work ,
lost both my parents when i was young , so ..
is that why you never married or had kids ?
well , now that we 've analyzed each other ,
how are you guys coming ?
how do we get rid of the chemicals and still make it look and smell nice ?
good . all right then , start searching .
oh , my god !
dude ! oh , god , did you see that ?

it wasn 't even a question .
you 're kind of who i want to be when i grow up .

but i have to be the person that she thinks i am or .
and i couldn 't survive that .
i don ' .

thanks .
was kind of a regular .
our data shows a 37 % increase in sales
how much of a price ?
thank you .
my god , can we bring that down ?
the game was to create a line that was more profitable , not less .
that 'd be admitting that we couldn 't do what we said we could .
oh , everything i touch gets ruined .
what 's wrong ?
not yet .
so you didn 't come clean ?
i ust should have stuck with what got me there .
so many products .
you got your under-eye , your face cream , your hand cream ,
" i 'm not great at these things .
the whole nutralis scandal was felix 's idea .
i wouldn 't do it .

i haven 't even touched a camera in , like , five years .

your dad needs you to be happy .
we just found each other .
what you thinking about ?
something my ex-boyfriend said earlier . i saw him tonight .
i didn 't know you had a .
why 'd you guys split ?
why not ?
everything happens for a reason , right ?
we 're building a company with dad .
as it all a lie ?
the stuff about the adoption agency . them telling you not to look for me .
no , of course not .
listen , this is why i tried calling you last night .
i got my girl back .
he negotiated points on some convertible debt .
we spend half our lives looking back , wishing .
chosen smarter ,
even the gay one .
as far as relationships go , forget it .
three of them are dead .
but now they 've abandoned me , too .
everything i love ..
we 're all married .
stop calling me lynette . it 's really creeping me out .
why don 't you all come back to my place
we 're not on speaking terms right now .
i tried .
well , my recommendation ?
we should 've seen this coming .
such a tragedy . so much potential .
excuse me .
pathetic much ?
i just need to talk to tom for five minutes
who 's there ?
this is ms. schoenfield .
it 's really important i talk with tom .
jeez , stalk much ?
seriously ? my mom told me you were hiding under his bed

it 's clear jimmy feels conflicted
mrs. manzani , go ahead .
i have somewhere i need to be .
i thought you worked here .
his girlfriend .
girlfriend ?
he 's got nothing else .
what you think he knows
god , this is a hell of a time for me to be stuck in here .
you just focus on getting better .

i 'm gonna run to the men 's room . it 's a long flight ,
hey , lynette .
okay . i 'm confused .
i 'm sorry . i have to tell you something ,
i 'm an accessory to murder .
i think you 've helped enough .
can 't we talk for a minute ?
wait . what do you mean ?
he called us down to the station and grilled us one by one .
good question , given this whole thing is about you .
bree , he wants revenge . he wants to bring you down ,
i will figure out a way to make things better .
don 't talk .
now before i give it to you ..
what i was going to say ..
they 're my whole world . i have nothing else .
that 's a bad position to make a deal from .
hey , you remember that deal i wanted to make with you ?
but at least he 's honest about it .
actually , you were the reason for that .
do you remember when we were talking about this guy ?
yep .
she likes cooking italian because according to her ,
i 'll have to have you over for spaghetti some night .
oh . um , okay .
will you cut up hot dogs into little chunks and mix them in with the sauce ?
oh , it 's all right ; i do .
hey , where you been ?
what 's wrong with you ?
that 's totally uncool .
i 'm over it .
is he making any progress ?
certainly .
so , you guys want to do something tonight ?
18 overweight women flapping their arm fat in a swimming pool .
for an hour and a half ?
satellites are down . solar flares .

no , i don 't want to do it . you can do it .
i just took him for shoes .
fine . i 'll take him for shoes next saturday .
you 're taking him to disneyland ?
was i going to say " no " ?
but let me know if you 're going to stuff him with junk food .
we 're going to disneyland .
the cards seem completely out of order and random ,
you get a sense of how everything fits together .
and i said no planes , but we don 't have a choice ,
sorry . my bad " ?
hey , jackson , you 're talking to sloan , right ?
yeah . not about work stuff , though .
what is wrong with you two ?
arizona 's not gonna lose her leg ,
so let 's act like it .
we 're all going to be fine .
as long as she needs .
they say , if you don 't have something nice to say ...
come on , yang . i 'm wide open . just hit me .
look , she is clearly a danger .
look , there is nothing physically wrong with her .
i am the chief of surgery and her husband .
well , with all due respect , sir ,
okay . it 's time .
they are gonna take you upstairs
and you 'll never be you again .
you have to say something .
do you hear me ?
1 , ' 1ef
the tumor can recur too easily .
you get it all , she 's cured .
that 's why we keep him around .

like the past five years has never happened ?
oh , okay . well , then you should just go then .
meredith ..
and owen isn 't your person .
what the hell did they do to this guy out there ?
i just feel like we 're losing him , derek .
i 'm so scared ,
promise ?
he 'll do whatever i say .
you heard what i told her .
pull it together .
damn it . i knew i shouldn 't have gone home .
just come see .
avery , tell me what 's going on .
where you been ?
yeah , his sats are good
and he 's making inappropriate sexual comments to brooks .
no , i still think that 's weird .
you tell her she 's beautiful just the way she is
no , but it 's how you talk to a woman , avery .
again , sometimes when you talk ,
she 's scared and she 's worried .
so pointless .
it 's why we 're doctors .
and whether we walk away leaving them better
if you love someone ,
i had that thought a lot , too .
i kept thinking about my wife and baby ,
so i kept wondering ...
and no matter how hard i tried to make him better ,
i keep wondering ..
so i guess i 'm still pretty pissed off .
hey . look who 's here .
bye , baby . i 'll see you tonight .
she goes from that apartment to the day care .
okay .
why the fuck would i do that ?
two and a half million dollars , unmarked .
can your team prep by 1 : 00 ?
there 's lots of exits .
we 'll have snipers cover the exterior .
i 'm right behind you .
yeah , i 've got eyes on him .
do not acknowledge that you can hear me .
you have him ? he 's out of my line of sight , jane .
i don 't want to say something that i 'm gonna regret .
i feel really stupid . i just ..
we 're just gonna sit and talk . that 's all .
hey , what 's going on ?

decreased breath sounds on the right side .

i like you more than i wanted to .
and i knew what this was .
well , i 've got a couple of thoughts about that .
well , i 'm not entirely sure it requires a professional .
incredible magnetism .
or only in town for a few weeks .
i 'm getting my fucking rematch !
and sadly , like many former professional athletes ,
as the spotlight faded
still , one can almost imagine him tonight
what the hell is happening ?
t don 't have a t. bad for the brain
man , come on , like .
you really wanna know ?
never told anybody this ,
the ching-a-ling . pony .
you don 't know a good thing when you see it .

a great performer knows when it 's time to get off the stage , kid .
he was 15 years younger than you .
i saw your eyes dart at my gut five seconds ago .
did you see that five seconds ago ?
i can 't believe you .
7oul were never curious about me ?
you respected that , but
you had me and i was just a big mistake .
hey ! you got 50 more feet !
lightning ?
oh , my god . i can 't believe he 's still alive .
so why are you here , sally ?
well , i 'm training right now . can 't do it .
you know , because of the fight and all and clips of us ,
you know , henry , it 's taken me almost 30 years to say this .
it 's okay .

i could be watching dancing with the stars .
then strike the hell om
good tip .
don i need this shi
let it go , kid .
bradley tames . it stands for bradley james , but i just .
it 's one thing to get one and it 's another to be called one .
kids in school use to say that ,
fighting you mean ?

none of this , none of this pilates crap .
i 'm talking johnson , i 'm talking dempsey , i 'm talking louis .
let 's go ! joe rrazier did this three hours a day !

and i choose to believe that
that 's funny . that 's real funny
they 're ready for you .
the octagon ?

they cover for you when you get in trouble .
you were everything in my life .
and you were different .
and everything started to fall apart .
i put it behind me . and i don 't wanna get emotional about it .
but why him ?
i can 't get it through my head .
i want to pound my head against .
why him ? he 's the worst guy in the world .
okay . okay .
you wanted to be alone . you wouldn 't return my calls .

and so ,
i think we 've depressed the shit out of these pigeons .
it 's the first time taking you alone . you nervous ?

let 's you and i get out of here .
so , what 'd you want to talk about ?
come on , i wasn 't paying attention .
how 'd you know ?
a two-year-old could 've seen that coming
a crucible blew up at the yard a couple of years ago .
i figured i could get by .
if he finds out he can hit you on the right , he can kill you .
i need to do this , light .
it 's too dangerous .
i 'm tired . have you seen kid ?
you gonna quit again ? again , you 're gonna quit ?
no way . i don 't think so .
what are you doing , you moron ?
because of her ? did she make you quit ?
hey , you made me wait 30 years
you 're gonna move on . move on !
now that you got her , you want me to move on ?
nothing . nothing

i let him take from me ,
i had some talent . i did
you 're stuck with me , believe me .
no matter how hard you guys work ,

besides , you don 't have much of a choice .
they 're all here ?
well , you don 't get to hear the languedoc much these days
my parents are from the basque country
how do you know it ?
no , you make yourself comfortable .
three girls dressed the same to rob a bank so no one knows who 's who .
see , the thing i can 't figure out is
one of us had to stay behind and look after dear old dad .
you could have left him tied up in the boot .
you 're not that smart if you 're calling him " old "
i hope the transfer code works .
here we go .

they 're both adults .
you know what ? you 're my best friend ,
this is stupid .
priority ones ...
4 people for 8 : 00 .

i wasn 't talking about him .
i like kids and i like their parents ,
i don 't like being used .
he can 't beat us every time .
how does he do it ?
i 'm kidding !
you 're 250 years old .
of course you 're better than us .
don 't worry !
he 's cheating .
klaud , i hope you fixed that surge .
but legend describes it as the hidden world of the sith .

harvest more of the galaxy 's young .
what is he asking for in return ?
my knights and i are going hunting

i wanna see your brains in the snow .
we gotta crack this droid 's head open and fast .

i 'm afraid artoo 's memory bank
that 's an old craft id .
it 's transmitting course marker signals
ships that size need help taking off .
so , how do the ships take off ?
except they won 't .
ground team ?
a power like life itself .
and now ...

oh , please !
and goodness knows what they 've done to my birds script .
cary 's great .
you 're still an artist , gracie .
many lives have been lost .
that means the stability of europe is under threat .
conflict is often a necessary evil .
oh , but colonialism is so last century .
i was brought up to participate
it is the american way .
this is not america , grace !
these children , they can 't live like this . it 's appalling
we 're running out of money and he has a lot of it .
were you considering accepting ?
well , if you really can 't do without it , i won 't stand in your way .
i don 't want people saying that i 'm running away or abandoning you .
gentlemen , have wonderful news .
and i 'd like to introduce to you rupert allan ,
no princess of monaco has ever taken to the stage before , altesse .
there is a first time for everything , mr delavenne .
as your press officer ,
but what about the prince ? the prince is very supportive .
what if the studio wants to publicise it ?
mr hitchcock has agreed to be discreet .
which won 't be until this crisis is over .
it 's a good likeness , no ?
i think that people have to work hard enough
not everybody is lucky enough to marry a prince .
move back guys , move back .
oh , i think we 'll all find out it 's been a terrible misunderstanding .
i 'm sorry ?
we received a copy of your press release today from universal pictures .
no , no .
maybe it wasn 't a mistake .
ok , that is enough . thank you .
why would they do this to me ? this isn 't about you , grace .
this is all about how de gaulle reacts .
listen to me .
if he even suspects there 's a french spy in the palace ,
phyllis . i hand-picked her .
here are a few reactions to the american plans of former
grace kelly .
she 'll never be one of us . she 's not from here .
they do that in films .
you 're married to my brother .
your children .... you must protect them .
it doesn 't ever get easier , does it ?
olitics is never on vacation miss calas .

you 're nothing but silent and angry .
you know i 've never been good at this sort of thing
oul vetted her . i needed a princess
there are no sides , ray .
it 's another role for you to play .
for almost a thousand years ,
since 1297
and his men captured the fortress protecting the rock of monaco
hello .
princess .
never before have journalists seen a princess
is it a dress rehearsal for hollywood ?
so many questions .
if we can get the media on our side ,
i 'll arrange for you to cross the western border .
the road passes through a pine-forest . i 'll meet you by the small cross .
any idea who you 're speaking to ?
she 's meeting with a french private detective .
do what you need to do .
i 've asked the vatican for a new post in the states .
and you 're just .
ray doesn 't need me any more . neither do you .
i 'll always need you .
t don 't know who else is involved .
i 'm a bad priest here , gracie .
if your family is to survive ,
dear god , we thank you for the food before us .
amen .
when does the shoot begin ?
i will not be returning to hollywood .
i left grace kelly behind when i married prince rainier
you can 't banish me
long enough to see the back of you .
and why would i do that ?
are you absolutely sure ?
she 's keeping herself busy , that 's all .
oh , he 's just about ready to agree to anything ..
good . your loyalty to france won 't go without reward , jean-charles .
shouldn 't we shun this ball ?

what are you listing as the cause of death ?
she died from a pulmonary hemorrhage .
fluid builds in the lungs
sorry , you 're not listing this as a homicide ?

uh , the circumstances is your field , not mine .
no , i don 't need it explained !
i mean , clearly she wouldn 't have been running through the snow
and i can 't get an fbi team to the reservation

in order to maximize the chance of human survival .

i 'm looking for my son , jesse , jesse rivera .
down the hall to the right , sir .
so what did you find out ?
i 'm a bad mother .
i know bad mothers . i came out of one .
you know a gathering of more than two white people
ah , same thing .
we 're interested in renting this location
i get it .
dude , i 'm from pasadena .
i never thought i 'd be in a tv show
i feel like brenda from 90210
damn , this room 's got a sweet spread .
free dessert ? uh duh .
we 've gotta figure out a way to get paid
would it be tacky
this is the vip lounge .
stay for a glass of champagne , max .
my driver can take you .
because as much as i don 't want you
come on , let 's sit down and hang out .
max there , caroline there ,
you know , i love this hotel .
and he wanted to take an inch off
so was that okay ?
it-it 's just max is here ,
that was nice .
i 'm eating a cinnamon altoid .
look , dj , i think you have the wrong idea .
i would never interrupt this for a work call ,
i 'm not talking my way out of this one .
yeah .
what do we do , max ? i don 't want to offend him .
this is the oldest tale in the book
look at the bright side .
and now that he 's married ,
no , max , i can just tell him how i feel .
you heard me tell him he read the signs wrong .
just close the window if you don 't like the smell .
it 's salt and fat .
so , there 's something you like ,
no , it-it 's a distraction .
so , go get one .
that 's why i have a rigid schedule .
you know , why don 't i just go down to the food truck
no reason .
what could be better than this ?
i 'll give it back .
one of the propellers is broken .
oh . do you think you could fix it ?
yeah , that 's probably a good idea .
looks like it 's ours .
oh . yay , we got a drone .
the exact price of a new gavel .
as a friend , i was touched .
do you know he is the entire tenants association ?
he 's also the pope of a planet he invented in hyperspace .
you can 't just declare yourself president .
i nominated myself , and after a pretty moving speech ,
yeah .
when is that ?
unless there 's an emergency meeting .
you really don 't have to .
i-i just can 't think of another word .
yeah . i think i have her address on my mailing list .
you think you 've got a shot ?
she 's not .
a little tip .
hi . what are you doing ?
" you must be at least this tall to use washing machine " ?
and then his clothes will smell .
all right , then . my so-called friends have forsaken me .
oh , balls .
it won 't help my case
that 's just wrong .
wait , hold on . before we get to the courthouse .
what is this ?
now , don 't worry ; it 's written in your vernacular .
do i have a choice ?
although we live in a deterministic universe ,
i call your attention to the events of november 16 .
really ?
dr. cooper , before i find you in contempt
i can 't wait to ask stan lee
hey , buddies .
what happened ?
you guys wouldn 't know anything about that , would you ?
and i may have hit on her a little bit .
i see .
i feel awful
you 're sleeping now .
do you have any evidence to support that hypothesis ?
that seems fairly conclusive .
thank you for agreeing to see me , agent page .
that 's not how it looks in the picture .
why don 't you give it a try .
to the metric system .
all right . sheldon , what 's on your mind ?
oh , right , that .
penny , you face failure on a daily basis .
i drink .
nope .
you know , sometimes stuff just happens ,
i see .
i am your son .
but if you don 't have our new jerseys for tonight 's game
i have the jerseys .
come on , come on .
can you please put that down on your little form ,
that is why we 're not gonna give you any money .
no , we 're not a pawn shop .
and for all these reasons , i have to turn down your application .
all right . i understand .
i 'm gonna call the bar association today , reactivate my license .
i lost it because of a small formality .
this envelope contains the profiles of 142 of your children .
brett .
i think i 'm going crazy , because i swear
it 's the law , okay ? i 'm entitled to parental leave .
you absolutely have to have kids , david .
how many times have i covered for you ?
i 'm begging you , man .
i can 't even talk to you .
oh , i 'm sorry .
who the hell are you , man ?
if you want to be a waiter ..
i am an actor missing the opportunity of a lifetime right now .
you want me to smile when i am totally pissing away my life ?
okay .
good afternoon .
yes or no ?
it isn 't always empty . i can 't leave you with the shop .
yeah , and how do i know you won 't just walk off with the cash ?
and why would you do this ?
bring it back without a scratch .
i can figure out how to make a cup of coffee .
and you decide to disappear ?
and in spite of having the simplest job , you manage to do the job badly !
there are only two components to your chosen occupation .
that 's not what i ordered
i do the hiring here .
rine . he can look for another job , then .
that 's not the problem .
he 's not a good actor . he has never been cast .
tell me ! what am i supposed to do now ?
you , uh , won your pizza .
you won our , uh ..
i just got this great job
i 'm going to sign the release .
she says she 'll be happy .
she needs to stop using
i do
where do you work ?
you 're okay for tonight ? yes .
the objective wouldn 't be to always have them there
i just want to say that ..
but .
but , whatever happens ,
hey !
why doesn 't he dribble ?
everybody 's gonna be there .
but you were the one who came up with this whole concept
anyway , i spend a heck of a lot of time with you .
f 'amily .
just because you decided to turn the page
viggo !
that i lied to the woman carrying my child .
i don 't think we need to continue to dwell on our little misunderstanding
with your fake kids .
fake ? viggo , what the hell are you talking about ?
david , your debt problems will go away .
it is all over twitter , it is all over the net
iwe 's donated 693 times !
anyway , listen . he went by the code name " starbuck . "
the mic .
here we are , outside of the new york courtroom .
what i 'm saying is ,
yeah
how would a normal person handle a situation like this ?
let 's just say that a normal person had a slight lapse of judgment
your brothers are not mentally equipped
why not just tell them ?
yeah , your debts .
yes , i know , pop .
what are you doing here , my dear ?
there are ghosts and demons up there !
but i want to go up there , mother !
how many times have i told you not to climb up there ?
you are my darling , right ? you won 't do it again , right ?
it goes way up into the clouds ..
he always slips and falls after the first hundred feet .
watch ! he is going to come sliding down again .
your mother is up to something there !
that is fifteen !
sage , if i do this , will my son listen to me ?
of course ! this is a powerful ritual !
alright ! o ! sage .
mother , you are not getting younger , are you ?
out of my way !
why should i ? do you ever listen to me ?
shiva , stop !
shiva .
and his forehead shining like a brilliant fire
he brought with him eternal light spreading everywhere .
river bhagirathi , lord shiva head towards you .
with the stream of merciful look which removes hardships
he , who is with his bride whose face is decorated
makes my mind happy and contented in him
tt was tied to his wrist . i took it from him .
let me go ! let me .
dilip too has attained martyrdom , chief !
that monster from the palace has imprisoned our princess
our pride and honour is injured and we suffer in silence .
if we are to achieve our goal
our body is for our lost motherland , kuntala kingdom .
my leader ...
called kattappa of mahishmati
he is indeed a good man .
but he won 't .
kattappa .
the ore is extracted from the depths of baghdad mines .
you are the head of the armoury , how can you be a slave ?
he forges the weapons for war .
i will pay 10 , even 100 times that to buy your freedom .
my ancestors pledged that everyone born in our clan .
for a pledge that a long forgotten ancestor made
as long as the sun , moon and stars are shining there .
a flourished kingdom , happy subjects
our flag with the emblem of the rising sun
we haven 't broken it yet . it is quite dangerous ...
i know deep in your heart
how do you do it ?
alright ! you deserve it ! ask for a reward .
your majesty !
at least , accept it now .
and i will break these shackles and set you free .
no , kattappa .
how can your dead child come back for you ?
he will come looking for me !
who is no longer alive , my lady !
birds chirp and ask you to take me along
write it with your eyes and make my heart your canvas .
the life i lived all these years has no value
birds chirp and ask you to take me along
this is something the world has never seen .
even the gods don 't get this honour .
yes , your majesty !
the applause and the din will be unprecedented , my lord !
i cannot let go of you nor can i abandon my duty
i also share your obligation .
if your goal is to free her
he hasn 't returned yet .
our son carried lord shiva 's idol all by himself ,
maybe he found his family .
will he never come ? will he not call me mother again ?
once again i request you to have that belief in me .
alright !
who says that baahubali ,
you are dead and yet you are alive in people 's heart .
the echo still lingers in these walls .
did the people express their bottled-up feelings ?
no ! impossible !
as to who uttered the name and why they did so !
what are you doing here ?
speak ! or i will have your tongues cut !
bunch of idiots as you are ! didn 't anyone of you see him ?
i have seen those eyes before !
my mother looks at me
and when i see the wounds that fester on that lady ...
who am t ?
the story you need to know began 50 years ago , my son .
though elder , bijaladeva was not crowned
the king died .
three months passed by and mahishmati continued to mourn .
being an astute woman
the empty throne reminds me of a widow 's forehead .
hail him !
a revolt at a time when the kingdom mourns
lady sivagami ?
who will support a woman , sivagami ?
they have soiled mahishmati with their revolt .
how can you stand and watch ..
move ! kill that slave and sivagami !
what kind of a question is that , minister ?
tell him , sivagami !
the one with more valour , compassion and wisdom
you found in her an ocean of affection .
amorosia and venom
feed me , uncle .
now flies the arrow that will pierce .
blallaladeva !
great bhalla !
both the princes have excelled
how are you going to decide who will be crowned , queen mother ?
now he is testing me
before she could decide on who will ascend the throne
kattappa .
kalakeya !
there is no limit to their morbidity .
they will destroy and burn everything
why should we be scared ?
one hundred thousand .
we have to defend our kingdom
i will command the forces to the north
our military formation and our weapons .
but we have to kill the chief during that time .
tn the middle of that battle
that will be enough , mother . victory will be ours .
accept it .
hail mahishmai !
your uncle has treated you unfairly .
of what use will those be in an open battlefield ?
you should have objected , baahu !
he lives two states away .
that 's why i need a new one .
sitting down .
ie 's memorized it word for word .
oh , it 's lasagna . it 's still good , take it .
david . call , line one .
where did they find him this time ?
i can 't take it anymore .
and mom 's right . it 's time to think about a home .
no . he doesn 't need a nursing home .
that 's al this is about .
seems like drinking always gave him more than enough to live for until now .
a home is in his best interests .
he never gave a shit about you or me
it 's your first time in the chair , right ?
and apparently i didn 't stink the place up too bad , so ..
the new tom brokaw of billings .
i 've paid my dues .
the council is expected to debate the propose ! in monday 's session .
how about we go see mount rushmore ?
it 's just 30 minutes off the interstate .
so , what do you think , dad ?
how do you mean ?
washington 's the only one with any clothes ,
let me know if i 'm hurting you , bud .
don 't worry about it . almost done .
you did great .
it took you two days to drive 750 miles ?
it 's a subaru . outback
i done that in eight hours .
oh , bart was moving .
thank you .
son of a bitch must have been driving in reverse .
ain 't that right , ray ?
did you get that , dad ?
could have been worse .
never came up .
how many you wanted and stuff like that ?
then why did you have us ?
mom , come here , please .
i mean , you and i both know
at least , semi-coherently .
you and ross , always fretting over your father .
what about taking me out to see my sister in eau claire ?
that farm just ruined him .
and there 's woody 's brother , david
woody slept in the same bed with him and never got it .
she was only 19
i 'm just telling you the truth .
come on , mom . jesus .
oh . they 're over in the catholic cemetery .
here 's delmer , woody 's cousin .
wow , they look like kids .
people took advantage of him .
now that everyone thinks he 's a millionaire ,
what are you having , old man ?
where does it say " meatloaf'
are we ready to order ?
do you have meatloaf ?
that 's only on the lunch buffet .
do you want the fried chicken , or the flame-broiled chicken breast ?
i was thinking about having the roast beef ,
it 's all good , but i 'm kind of partial to the tilapia .
i 'll have the tilapia .
that 's ed pegram singing
thank you .
uh , it 's no secret , though .
he was older than me . kind of like a big brother .
and i wanted to show him some respect ,
it seems to me only fair if we settled up .
woody owes me a lot more than that .
it 's all a big misunderstanding .
right , so you 're all headed down to lincoln
lawyer ?
what 's up , dad ? what 's wrong ?
tomorrow
and all your brothers are coming over today . remember ?
but god damn it
do you remember a gal you used to go out with
i don 't know . when ?
it was a long time ago .
snap to cutler .
he makes the grab and a first down to midfield .
oh , they 're out volunteering today .
they 'll be home in time for supper .
it 's community service , on account of colds rape .
well , what 's the difference ?
cole can explain it better than i can .
bears come out for their third possession .
a what
well , hell , i don 't know what it was , then .
are you still driving that ?
i thought you still had it .
uh . dance recital
how long did it take you to drive ?
not yet .
i went by the office and gave them the lowdown .
it 's okay .
let 's raise a glass to kate and woody , here .
they 're after dad 's " winnings . " right ?
see ? there is money .
what on earth are you talking about , betty ?
you know as well as i do it was the other way around .
aunt kate , we 're not asking for much . just a token .
the money you gave him didn 't come close to what you owed .
i think you 're having a senior moment , here , kate .
i don 't believe the nerve of you people .
calm down , aunt katie . we didn 't mean nothing by it .
don 't you dare think about asking that poor man for money .
even if he was , he wouldn 't give you a blessed penny .
may be it ain 't up to you , aunt kate .
you listen real good .
boys , get your dad .
okay ? can 't you get that through your head ?
it 's my own damn fault for taking you this far .
you can 't drive .
i want a new truck
that 's 1-3 !
yep , berk is pretty much perfect .
and it 's a good thing , too ,
so , what do you think , bud ?
this is amazing !
oh , no !
we-we got to work on your solo gliding there , bud
oh , what , do you want an apology ?
you know that doesn 't wash out
what do you reckon , bud ?
the odd whispering death or two in the rocks ?
wouldn 't that be something .
just keep going ?
very serious .
hiccup , that 's amazing !
the calibration is very sensitive
t- didn 't .
well .. it 's a lot of responsibility .
i-it 's not me , astrid .
i mean .. chief
i-i ... i 'm not like you .
that is a night fury .
looks like our luck 's had a turn for the better , lads !
in his dragon army .
look , we don 't want any trouble .
that 's right ! yeah , look at it !
what are you talking about ?
hah ! dragon trapping is hard enough work as it is
you mean other than your thieving friend from last night ? you tell me .
how do you suppose we explain this mess
does anything you say make sense ?
and drago don 't take well to excuses !
he promised to be far less understanding in the future .
just give us back our dragon , and we 'll go ..
oh , where are my manners ?
oh ! sorry , mrs. ack .
eh ! he 's probably flown
you can still delay your retirement .
there he is !
who finally decided to show up for work . yay .
hey , uh , dad , could i have a word ?
uh , not quite the itch you 're thinking of ,
now , lesson one : a chief 's first duty
uh , the dragons don 't really care
unless you do that .
h-how is your swimming ?
oops . almost forget .
give me that .
just what every dragon trapper needs .
the other sprays hideous zippleback gas .
once they see you as one of their own ,
he can be really persuasive .
you won 't be changing any minds around here .
uh , may i ?
you left my dragon back there !
we have to head back for my dragon !
the dragon thief ?
valka .
all because i couldn 't kill a dragon .
it broke my heart to stay away ,
he must have thought i belonged here
one of the very few
with his icy breath ,
this gift we share , hiccup ,
who we are .
we will make it a better , safer place .
oh , this is so great !
whac
we must protect our own .
we should be getting back .
now get this thing off me .
don 't you know anything ?
and once you move back in with all your dragons ,
slow down , son .
oh , gotcha .
remember our song , val ?
will stop me on my ... journey
and i would keep you from all harm
show them what you got , bud .
i 've waited a long time for this .
they are controlled by the alpha !
another one ?
oh .. i gotta go to work .
will take a while , market is jammed .
there 's construction on hyde .
and then just leave me on the corner of market .
adaline was driving north to her parents beach cottage ,
something almost magical .
the immersion in the frigid water ,
her heart stopped beating .
its effect was threefold
she will never age , another day
adaline

i 'm just tired of running ..

it 's not the same when there 's no future .
i mean a future together , growing old together .
it 's just heartbreak .
how many times have my heart been broken ?

the great paradox of all this is that .

ta 's how we go .
mr. huggins , you have one minute for a rebuttal .
what the hell ?
let 's clean up d.c .
there was a clear winner in the first debate .
two hours ago ,
i was jacked . i don 't know what i was saying .
bizarre news coming out of
this is likely to hurt him
after cam brady 's baby-punching incident ,
why have you consistently voted against campaign-finance reform ?
old on .
like why won 't marty huggins here
is he an al qaeda ? is he a taliban ?
i 've seen a mustache like that before , and you now who wore it ?
and i believe we never caught two of his sons ,
i am not beholden to cam brady 's accusations .
jesus loves you , marty .
good question .
hallelujah .
is that what we 're resorting to here ? gestapo tactics ?
would you like to hear him say the lord 's prayer ?
fine , i 'm happy to . ahem .
our father .
i think we can all agree .
all i know , if you say , " it 's a mess , "
ii was the last one to say something .
you want a holy war , little man ? you got one .
how do you say " it 's a mess " in hebrew ?
i have the faith in me
mitch , i could do this forever .
mitzi , look at this .
i was watching that .
you 're never home , and when you are , it 's all politics .
everybody 's got me running every which way but loose .
you have an opportunity to win this thing
can you do that ?
that 's my boy .
hey , dad .
hey , uh , i just wanna let you know that
so , uh , what are the issues you 're gonna run on ?
the black button looks like it has a lens in it .
look , i came over here tonight
cam , do you think i 'm an idiot ?
okay , then take off that camera , please .
i just ... i 'm so used to wearing one of these things
what is this we have here ?

i 'd love to .
did it happen to be coke zero ?
look , i 'd like to say one thing ,
you 're taking money from marty huggins ' campaign ?
yes . i did take money from marty huggins .
but you can rest assured that every dime ,
let 's change topics .
oh , there 's been no toll .
i find that laughable .
we are really hitting our stride , and my lovely wife is a rock .
hello , piers .
i 'm doing an interview .
yes .

marty huggins ,
now , we ought to think about how we gonna get back , okay ?
we gotta think logically here . now , what do you wanna do ?
coming .
marty 's down at the tourism office , so .... ..
it 's very katie couric .
may i come in and use your phone ?
best known for starting the samba-salsa jazz craze .
i find it tragic when someone isn 't recognized for perfection .
oh , uh , well , i love owls .
but i got some porcelain or maybe china ones .
oh , god , i know exactly what you 're talking about .
come on , little buddies . come on .
they 're marty 's dogs . they don 't listen to me
mitzi , i 'm gonna cut to the chase .

okay , well , get out of here . go .
inyone .
th , tason , sir .
but i 'm a poli sci major in college .
are you serious ?
n iice round of applause .
did you know that our government ,
look , ivarty i definitely did wrong .
the entire country is talking about what you did .
when did tim wattley
i think you should leave , mitzi .
it 's been a really good day .
we have purchased
and we immediately sold that real estate and debt
the 14th district now belongs to china .
actually , american workers are paid way too much
they 'll clock in at 50 cents an hour .
the word tested through the roof .
you have factories in china . why are you gonna bring them here ?
it 'll double the already-doubled profits that we make .
and today opponent marty huggins
listen , guys , he opened his life up , and it 's worked .
the whole country is still waiting on the result
with 90,362 votes , camden brady .
cam brady wins .
how can that be ?
words with friends , scrabble , draw something .
so i took a bunch of money from the motch brothers
not you , not me , not america .
jesus , i think we should take our leave . excuse me .
get away now . get away or l 'll start slapping people .
marty huggins . that son of a bitch fears no man .
sure , i know what you 're thinking : he 's a weirdo .
haven 't broken into his house and kidnapped him for a permanent display .
ome on up here , marty .
i 'd really like to work together again someday .
il 's a deal .
i started drinking again .
i hate when it gets dark early .
it 's a mess .
ice chips .

oh , she 's with other laboring moms right now .
you 're the only one i care about . the rest can wait .
yes and no .
you get this baby out of me safely .
what about william ?
sebastian shepherd ? that 's a bit of a mouthful .
i 'm not giving birth to a country singer .
i need f.f.p. , packed red blood cells , and platelets .
what ?
i might have injured something in my abdomen .
i 've been in labor .
ross , we don 't have time .
i 'm on it .
mine 's out , too .
see ? we 're handling it .
under control ? do the math .
you 're the only one left .
you don 't need my help .
no , you don 't ,
and you 're not gonna freak out .
don 't revive me . i do not want to be a vegetable .
shane , i need you to respond .
dr. ross , your ...
communication will be carried on in the language of the species to be judged .
understanding you now , sharon .
with great respect , sharon , we should not pronounce a destruction order
maureen is right .
if they cannot , we must eliminate them ,
not at all , miss barker .
no , i don 't want to see you , either .
what part of over do you not understand ?
these questions of yours make it sound as if i thought
that 's why we have to pee on it from a great height .
don 't you know ? she never reads the books . she hates books .
i spy trouble . just ..
no , i think people watch because it 's a book programme and they love books .
oh , so we 're not just selling out , then ? we 've sold out ?
for god 's sake , smile .
uh , page 56 , paragraph d .
to prove that they understand the difference between good and evil .
they will be given the power that all superior beings have .
what if you could make someone worship the ground you walked on ?
come on , ray .
okay , but suppose there was one thing you could do
that sounded ike it was in the school
now , just stay calm .
who was that ?
you say one word about this , constable , you 'll be on community relations .
uh , let everyone who died be alive again .
oh , no . no , no , no , no . no , i meant everybody in 10c be alive again !
shit . shit .
oh , shit , shit , shit !
oh , that 's better .
oh , that 's a good idea .
no , i mean , if you could make anything you wanted happen ,
i 'm sorry , what ?
that 's very weird . i think i just dreamt that i could .
what 's the truth under publishers ' blurbs ?
you 've come to the right place to find out .
mortimer , your last novel was published nearly ten years ago .
what possessed you to write another one ?
well , yes , but on her deathbed , she urged me to write another book .
this is a wonderful opportunity for you to get to know the real me .
no , not just the charming , high-flying military strategist .
not the inventor of extreme rendition , either .
or the mastermind behind warrantless domestic surveillance .
okay , grant , i appreciate that you like me ...
so similar to what you were wearing before .

i want to say salmon .
so , how are you gonna tell rai abut what you did ?
you told lucy he was a pathetic mess .
hey , what 're you working on ?
that 's a pretty cool idea .
i 'd love to get an engineer 's opinion .
this chair is squeaky .
well , sheldon , it took me all morning ,
anyway , there is no one to return the dvd to ,
you know , you could reimburse the video store owner 's next of kin .
you , too .
i , uh , i got you a cappuccino .
i also got crumb cake ,
i 'm pretty good .
well , and i ate all the crumb cake .
okay .
you know , as friends ,
i think i know the answer to this ,
i should 've listened to mun-mun
do you enjoy my pain ?
can you believe this is my first bar mitzvah ?
jewish people are so awesome .
people get that way in dance season .
luke , we have to go to that bar mitzvah .
there was a connection .
you made a very similar speech
that way i can spend some quality time
no , no , i 'm gonna take you both to lunch .
fine . i guess you won 't get in the way .
i won 't get in the way ?

what ? a break already ?
look , you do not have to go through this alone .
that 's really nice of you , mitchell ,
you and i could have a real gab fest .
mobile spinner .
what are you doing back here ? !
i thought about what you said before ...
well , in our house , i 'm kind of your only source for that .
haley e-mails me pictures of her nails .
he does get his head pretty far around .
it 's okay .
i guess i needed somebody to blame for what happened today ,
come on . i know a back way out of this place .
no way . i paid good money for this .
it means a lot to me .
" your husband 's dead . have some food . "
oh , hey . how 'd the surgery go ?
glad to see she 's not mad at me anymore .
we just did a mitral valve repair without bypass ,
how long 's it been since you slept ?
i 've done , like , 8 surgeries in the past 72 hours .
he 's my patient .
i 'm taking over the patient .
back off , yang . i met the ambulance .
a 32 year old ran his bike into a wrought iron fence .
i know how to deal with these injuries .
actually . wes , we may be postponing hawaii .
really ? then i won 't have these aches anymore ?
what about ortho ? callie would be a great mentor .
oncology .
what the hell ?
i thought i was gonna have time to go to the store ,
no . go for it . you know what ? take this one , too .
got it
cristina ?
i 'm , uh , gonna watch a surgery .
you need sleep .
it 's a lot like sleeping .
uh , i didn 't say that .
i know , i know , you don 't want to talk about it .
get past this with her ?
you just gotta deal with it .
oh , god .
yeah , i-i will go find your husband .
um , could you just stay with her
okay , well , uh , i have an office on the third floor .
we don 't get this tumor , this surgery is for nothing .
are you asking me or telling me ?
i mean , um , we could mobilize the great vessels ,
i 've attached the hepatic veins .
he left me . he left me . i don 't want to see him working .
right here between these two ?
you should 've informed me .
dr. yang stopped and had a nice little chat with me
i think you 're lying to me . both of you .
can we get into this later ?
yes . why don 't you pull it over ?
did you see that throbbing vein ...
i have the hardest time keeping a straight face
the surgery wasn 't as hard as they first thought ,
i think " thank you " is what you were looking for ,
you have no idea what 's going on here , do you ?
you let me operate on her husband ,
anything she wants from me , ever .
bailey says you 're declaring general .
oh . oh , i ... thought it was a done deal .
let 's go ! let 's go , baby . let 's go !
don 't drop that guard ! sit .
keep your hands up !
come on , d !
wheeler 's power just isn 't the same , and no doubt creed can sense it .
creed 's on a mission , really pressing the issue now .
creed staying in the pocket , max . moving , not running .
these two men are really going at it .
another left hook drives wheeler back .
ain 't nothing personal .
call it whatever you want .
the money is a side effect .
somebody had to make it happen .
oh , yeah , that 's supposed to be you , huh ?
i want the same thing you want .
in the history of boxing ,
but how many do you think they know ?
five ?
you need a narrative . something that sticks to the ribs .
creed clearly in pain , as he finds a way to his feet .
i don 't know . this is getting dangerous , jim .
and now , bayless is gonna let him go again .
box !
huge right hook !
and creed delivers a big right hand at the bell .
bayless restraining drago , seemingly frustrated ..
you gonna counter with the right
he 'll never expect it . his old man did the same thing to me .
i think creed is withstanding drago 's combinations
and round two begins .
and a big right hand .
once we came up with a closed seeding system ,
i have a question .
does the difference in tensile strength
and testing revealed a tensile strength of 0.6 megapascals .
we expect our conduits to grow and remodel
mm . fine . i 'm actually killing it .
i can 't do this .
you know how hard to go now .
i just think it 's kind of shocking that the first option
can you just be on my side ?
don 't worry about annie . i 've got her .
okay , let 's get annie next door asap .
all these printers are yours ?
there 's ...
i can 't stand that .
dr. bailey , i have braden 's most recent results .
you 're testing his white blood cell differential .
a boy with no immune system grew over 500 t-cells overnight .
okay , it worked !
it 's amazing
so you agree ?
yep . either you 're a surgeon or you 're not .
i 'll end up back in school .
will you stop ?
i went crazy very publicly .
these are all people 's pets ?
i saw those kids .
yeah .
see this one over here ? i carved this myself .
that 's short for winston churchill .
oh , i know who winston churchill is .
i 'm afraid so .
i didn 't know who to call .
your parents should never have left you alone with her . never .
no , no , no , no , no , no ,
that does not make you a monster . okay ?
tell you what .
we 'll just tell ellie that he ran away .
nobody can .
there are places in this world
nobody knows what that place is ,
we 're at work .
it 's been so long , i have the tolerance of a fetus .
the third glass is still bad .
i wanna have an article on her site someday .
suze gets invited to cool shit . i miss all of it .
you 're welcome to take this seat until my colleague gets here .
actually , it 's just the most expensive seat .
but you 're welcome to sit here until my colleague arrives .
thank you .
hey , you 're home before me . did you quit ?
making suze some dinner .
why did you say it like that ? why 'd your voice go up ?
becca 's engagement party is next weekend . i need to guarantee that i can be there
there 's a wine festival next weekend , and you 're gonna plant all the information
okay .
i literally just quit .
and even when she 's complaining about you , she 's really complimenting you .
i don 't know what you think you 're getting out of this , but you deserve better .
oh , my god . cave myself goose bumps .
what 's my favorite food ?
thought you said you weren 't working over christmas .
hey , roger , what 's up ?
you know what ? after what you pulled , you can do that alone .
ah , it 's a christmas cluster-eff over here .
wait . mom , aren 't we gonna watch charlie brown ?
because they are family , beth .
well , i 'm not sharing my room with girls who pee standing up .
human shit . for the last time , that was their dog !
omi ? hmm ?
what do you mean ?
your mom popping xanax again ? like candy .
awesome than it actually is , you know ?
careful , kids .
from macaroni and cheese with hot dogs .
well , you were wrong .
what are you now , a jew ?
it 's delicious , honey . it 's a little dry .
well , i guess i should have gotten your bird .
i 'll say it when she gets back if dessert 's good .
just say something nice about dessert . hey .
no , stevie . what happened to santa ?
shattered both his legs .
so , to survive , he had to slaughter and eat his reindeer .
" ate " tiny reindeer . get it ?
don 't start anything .
macaroni and cheese and hot dogs . oh , jesus .
plant your feet . all right . right .
be careful , okay ? okay . back later .
okay .
she went to her boyfriend 's earlier and she hasn 't come back yet .
aunt dorothy , please .
it 's probably nothing . but i thought we 'd go pick her up ,
okay .
and as he had for thousands of years ,
he and his helpers .
but krampus didn 't take me that night .
the keys were in the ignition , and it was beat to hell .
and go where ?
and if it 's empty , we 'll try the police station .
then we keep driving till we see lights or people ,
for beth and howie .
well , a shepherd 's got to protect his flock .
welcome to miss charlotte 's doll academy .
how can i serve you today ?
really ?
but i do let good little girls adopt some of my friends .
i don 't care .
she would love a doll ,
very good . i have someone in our royalty cabinet
my lava lamp ?
man , my stuff is clumsy .
everything that happened over the last few days
it 's only slightly worse than your aftershave ,
there is a god .
well , obviously , i want to help my daughter .
we 'll do whatever it takes .
so we canvassed your neighborhood
they all did .
so ... what 's the next step ?
what kind of questions ?
my wife is not a suspect in this investigation .
okay . uh ...
not that i can think of .
what are these photos of grace still doing here ?
you should have gotten rid of these the second we got back from the doctor 's .
what are you gonna do with them ?
no . we have to throw these away .
juanita could find them .
dr. lunt never said we had to throw grace 's photos in the trash .
you understand what that means ?
now give me your phone , please .
i 'm going to delete every photo of grace .
juanita is in pain !
and i 'd feel a lot better if i had your support .
god , i can 't believe you 're back .
the vases , the calligraphy . the two styles ..
and for your hotel , we think it would look ...
but not this time . i love it .
well , we should be . we 've been best friends for 25 years .
aren 't you afraid of getting food on it ?
keith .
well , i suppose i should be happy it wasn 't his own feces .
let 's just put this behind us , shall we ?
oh , and please pass the peas .
bree .
tell me you don 't feel the same way .
do you know how easy it would be for me to ... become that woman again ?
then do it . we have a connection , bree , and you know it .
but i 've made a new connection .
yes , and i will always have feelings for you , but i 've ... changed .
i ... i can 't articulate it to you because i don 't understand it myself .
i don 't believe it .
you will always have a piece of my heart ,
so ? did you tell him ?
what ?
please ? he 's very fragile right now .
well , i can 't just throw him out .
what ? !
bree there 's nothing to talk about !
let 's just cut our losses .
that 's who i was , not who i am now .
uh , well ... yes .
you know what ?
mrs. delfino you 're in no condition to be getting out of bed .
let me at least call you an orderly and get you a wheelchair .
look , i need to do this . he 's scared .
oh , not too long . trust me , sweetie .
i noticed we were running low last week ,
oh , probably because the last time i looked in there ,
really ? i thought it was a one time thing .
thanks for ordering these , i 've just been so busy
someone 's here already ?
is that a stereotype i don 't know about ?
i mean , if i had known , i would have dressed !
now get ready for entrance number two .
i can 't believe it .
could anything be more wonderful ?
i liked it better than the book .
can you talk a little bit about the women
moving on , maria alonso-gonzalez ,
i need to make room for han 's body .
and by " we , " i mean you .
because if i learned three things from cops ,
i got some kids looking for me and they don 't need the help .

with half the population you can implant false memories
i 'm just happier now .
he looks forward to seeing you again , that 's good .
no , no , not really .
jonas .
oh , it must be such a drag , jonas , putting it about .
i like him .
i didn 't say anything .

wow , it 's early . it 's early to call it a night .
oh , we 've got to get back ,
well , actually , what time is it ?
shit , it 's quite late . time 's gone on .
but we 've got the babysitter inside , so ...
no , it 's just that we , i mean , we thought , right , fi ?
big deal , big hear-breaker ?
it was a weird week .
the point is , it wasn 't a big deal .
jonas , king dormouse-dick of marrakech
you 're getting obsessed .
we had all this with dan , i don 't want you going like that again .
i 'm staying faithful to my corn flakes right now .
i don 't really want to get involved .
my dad 's on his way .
we both want him to come back ,
wow , it 's early . it 's early to call it a night .
got to get back ,
sorry .
i don 't know , a redo of the side of his fridge , something like that .
your gauges are all over the place , hot and cold .
you can 't hide it . not completely .
the less the relationship means ,
now , how you look at me .
does it matter ?
just not trustworthy .
and big ones .
does that look like marrakech ?
so , how long did you go out with him for ?
so not a week or a month . six months .
you 're probably still going out with him .
what 's been going on ?
yeah , sure . i 'll let you in .
what do you want ?
that looks expensive . is that expensive ?
fucking hell . liam .
i thought you were meant to be fucking brilliant .
yeah , figures .
i think you should go .
go on , chuck it on the screen , don 't be shy .
i 'm fucking joking again , jonas .
he 's uptight , isn 't he ?
it 's a lovely room , this .
yes , i was expecting your call . three years ago .
wait . what happens if i choose not to give a speech ?
and if i don 't want to forfeit the award ?
all right .
problem .
they expect me to give a speech at the banquet .
well , no , you 're mistaken . you give speeches all the time .
yeah , before the movie ,
i am perfectly comfortable speaking to small groups .
like , uh , professor xavier and his x-men .
did i see x-men ?
oh . i say a lot of things , sweetie .
i don 't know .
might give you more confidence .
leonard ?
what qualifies you to attempt to understand my mind ?
then , put on a sweater .
yeah , whatever . just go buy a sweater .
you own the damn thing . just take a freaking sweater !
all right .

a godzilla-like monster is approaching the city .
people of sheldonopolis , this is your mayor .
if the children can 't run , leave them behind .
rai ?
i question your premise .
it 'll give you confidence .
don 't you eventually realize you 're just the same stressed out person
now , let 's see what we 've got .
that 's a lot of money for only one color .
why don 't you pick out what you like .
no . you 're wrong .
okay , i think we have a winner .
in the prom department .
please just try this one on .
this is absurd . i look like a clown .
.... how you doing ?
go on .
i had never seen my brother 's project .
so , i hear you saying you 're angry with your mother .
for god 's sake , i was eight years old .
that 's when the bed-wetting started again .
for what ?
wait , that 's it ? i thought we had a whole hour !
but before i do ,
she 's proud of him . i wonder what that feels like ...
i 'll have to re-pipe the whole system .
i 'll do the job at cost , but you 're still looking at six , seven grand .
look , um .. if money 's an issue ...
you don 't consider sewage backing up in the house a priority ?
so , what brings you here ?
i thought as much .
there is .
wow . that 's a big favor .
i have some money that i 've been putting aside for emergencies .
keep my mouth shut ?
gosh , i don 't know .
all you need to do is remove one little name .
they 're so cocky . they know they have the upper hand .
maybe 15 years ago . not anymore . now we 're just lonely and desperate .
i don 't want crumbs . i want mike .
i 'm sorry . it 's just so hard to find a guy like mike .
i came by to bring you your key . i was just about to leave you a note .
what the hell is going on here ?
my note was gonna tell you that i , um ... i ... i wasn 't kidding this afternoon .
to use if the mood strikes me .
you know i 'm proud of you , right ?
life ain 't all about racing , you know ?

you shouldn 't throw these away .
party 's kicking up to phase two and y all are just chilling in the garage .

jay has been very explicit
making your birthday dreams comes true .
should we put him in the trunk ?
you said there were no bad ideas .
i thought you said the hood would calm him down .
don 't worry , gloria . we 'll have him back in time for dinner .
it really is .
uh , dark .
well , you would 've been right .
i don 't think my falcon could have found that many ,
i thought we were talking about jay turning 65
i 'm telling ya . i got a vegetable garden .
now i got tomatoes , i got five kinds of beans ,
why would that be between you and me ?
but don 't worry . all you guys are on the list .
to jay , who 's not particularly buoyant .
but he 's the best father-in-law a guy could ask for .
that 's great . it 's great ! you 're pregnant !
it was a surprise .
i haven 't told him yet .
ohh , no . don 't be silly .
i knew he wasn 't gonna be thrilled .
you know , you 're a real smart-ass .
lucky .
i gotta tell you something .
and for the first time in your life ,
you never do .
so could you please just be loving and supportive ?
oh , thank you .
sorry we 're late , but it 's for a good reason .

i 'm just looking out for your best interests .
but officer bellick , you and i both know that

i read your psych records .

i-i don 't know anything about show business ,
are you sure ?
we didn 't get to tap the juicy vein that is howard 's .
why do you constantly feel the need to put down my husband ?
the same way my boyfriend makes me feel terrible
no , no , no . this is not a fight .
now it 's a fight .
howard started it .
i wasn 't referring to this evening .
isn 't it a little late to get plane tick ...
plane tickets ? yeah .

my car threw a rod and it 's totaled .
i 'm so sorry .

i 'm surprised you made it .

you wouldn 't send all the information together .
at the same time as the london e-mail ?
two more e-mails followed from the same ip path .
it picked up the ip address , but not the content .
oh , look , e-mails get bounced to routers all over the world .
wherever the mail 's been , it leaves a shadow file .
probably squatted at the anaheim server cluster ..
so that 's where you 're going to find your shadow file .
not every geek with a commodore 64 can hack into nasa .
have more firewalls than the devil 's bedroom .
it 's on a main server in anaheim .
i know what you 're planning , alex .
if you do track him down , call me .
i won 't .
and alex , i 'm so sorry .
i 'm sorry , they can 't see you today .

the next time you run from me .
i have not heard a word for weeks !
don 't worry about leo .
this is war , sonya !
the scientist whom joan and i worked with in canada .

i 've let her draw hearts on my upper thigh for the last 10 minutes .
hey , logan , is that your new girlfriend ?

tell the truth , you 've been sitting there since graduation , haven 't you ?
they really should have a bar right by the entrance
and i haven 't been on my bike since valentina was born .
well , i 'll be damned .
as we say goodbye to old friends .
some people just call it texting .
heh . of course you do . it 's a party .
i have told this story about 10 zillion times , but okay .
it 's pretty boring partying on a boat after about 15 minutes .
ripped the boat apart looking for her .
last time i saw susan , she was blowing chunks over the side of the boat .
what a nightmare .
must have been awful when you figured out she was missing .
i still can 't go on a boat .
you already have a job . it 's in new york .
don 't let this town take you down like it does everyone else .
well , love is blind
i have someone in the sheriff 's department ..
the nerve ? the sheriff 's department is a joke .
they 're dangerous , veronica .
i want you to stay away from them .
well , that 's not that bad .
or i could just play her in drag . hey , penny , give me your glasses .
if you 've got the cash , i 've got some hidden video i know you 'll want to see .
good job , fen .
of course .
here 's a tip . change professions .
i need everything you got off bonnie deville 's tablet .
i am just a respectable businessman trying to earn an honest dollar .
or i 'll tell 50 cent 's security team where they can find the guy ...
while singing " afternoon delight . "
do you have any idea what people will pay ..
t do the circuit .
if you have more than five imdb credits .
ha , ha . i 'm the reason people know anne hathaway has a vagina .
anyway , you 'll like this . i stuffed 30 tablets into those mtv gift bags .
you 're legal now , right ?
i 'm assuming it 's a signed confession .
quickly . guards at the security gate checked logan in at 1 : 15 a.m .
time of death sometime between 1 : 21 and 1 : 31
many people , including free hugs over here , spoke to carrie after that .
carrie was alive when gia left , but gia didn 't go alone .
probably in the trunk .
he waited for his opportunity .
he shows up at the 09er , establishing a very public alibi .
i suppose they murdered her for kicks .
they murdered carrie because they were convinced she was cracking .
something worth killing carrie to keep secret
where 'd you get these official police photos ?
that foreman hands down a life sentence .
i don 't care if logan ain 't the guy .
now get the hell out of my office .
i , uh .. i believe the captain told you that the use of cell phones was prohibited .
yeah , i gathered . i really wanna be there with you .
i just ... i couldn 't leave .
okay .
i completely understand .
just walk away .
i mean , that 's not what i want .
who flew to new york mostly to meet you .
i wish that same feeling made you get on the plane today .
she 's concerned that her blowout 's gonna flatten before you get here .
logan 's coming over to talk about the case .
what ? i 'm over 21
okay . i 'll give them a call . thanks .
they needed someone a little more " motivated , " i think it was . or " dedicated
you worked so hard for so long ...
you 're throwing it away ?
this is keith
i 'm gonna .. i 'll be right back .
i guess i picked the wrong week to quit smoking .
she immediately freaked out and called her partner in crime .
i can 't actually see luke right now .
what are you talking about ?
what 's he doing at . ? oh .
so i just got this call from this random number and ..
she called cobb for help .
you are protecting his bright future , right ?
i was at the 09er . there are witnesses . everybody saw me .
we 're past that now .
i even have proof you were there .
the baby that she gave up for adoption .
carrie found her later and she was barely breathing .
we were picturing jail time .
well , i appreciate you keeping it pg-13 for me .
i got you off murder charges .
listen , it 's 180 days , veronica .
our story is epic
yeah .
so , what now ?
i know all about accepting the things i can 't change .
your point guard shoots too much . i 'm with you , fennel . bench him .
even if it means disappointing the one man i can 't bear to disappoint .
now , you cut one down in arizona , you can do a year in prison . imagine that ?
i know guys that rob people in here
i haven 't slept in a few nights . but other than that ...
what happened here ?
i got groceries for you .
aw , do you got any real food ?
i don 't know , henry . take a wild guess . maybe water or milk or something .
it 's been confirmed that the victim is boston police captain john boylan .
no arrests have been made .
thank you for that . there is a city-wide manhunt ...
was it you ?
son of a bitch , they finally killed boylan .
i can see ' em .
beautiful truck . she is . her name is black betty .
your hands and feet are in charge of 80,000 pounds of fast moving steel
you mess up ,
you 're not gonna get away with it .
any questions ?
hey .
and if this is real ,
we should go check it out .
hundred bucks says i 'm right .
but let 's go ; i 'll drive .
oh , man , this just keeps getting better .
extremely .
dispatch , charlie 0-5 stokes .
i need two backup units to my location .
hey . hey !
yeah , well , now it 's our evidence .
you can call my boss .
i came by ' cause i saw the picture on the web site .
so you called in your own 419 off a web posting ?
don 't tell me you 're dropping bodies for extra cash .
t.o.d. was four to six hours ago .
when i say that , i mean , like , in a live way .
and how did you two get together ?
" carrot top 's wild ride . "
i know , shocker , right ?
it was great ' cause some of my fans were there ,
she was the " everything else , " yeah .
very attractive .
i don 't remember them as well .
uh , my eyes were more on the girl .
well , you 're lucky you didn 't end up like amber .
yeah .
i get , like , one phone call , don 't i ?
i know , i need my publicist .
i take it that 's greek ?
that and the skirt were my idea .
spartacus was in that limo .
well , it 's not so much the skirt
scene of the crime .
like to think i can handle myself ,
how did she get you that much cash
they scan cash now .
and if one of our chicago boys gave her the money ,
you 're leaving , harold ?
did you finish with the thing on the drive-thru ?
okay'
did you get your shift meal yet ?
i 'm gonna hold off on that .
oh , there you go . you should .
i 'm not really a cookies-and-cream person , but that one is good .
a what ?
we ain 't got no pickles .
nah .
god .
swear i wasn 't even supposed to be here right now neither .
i want monday through thursday , saturday , like i used to .
if they don 't stay normal about it ,
oh ! now that you say that , i could see what you saying .
i 'm always waking up late .
hey , what 's all that ?
hi . welcome to chickwich . what can i get for you ?
can i get a number one ?
what ?
they don 't open . there 's nothing in them .
yeah , i know . i 'm sorry , but they were dirty . i didn 't ...
okay , good . uh , does she have a purse ?
i have ... i still have my purse .
it would be in the employee cubicle area ,
miss , be quiet .
now , had you seen this woman before on the premises ?
i am being s .. i 'm .. i 'm being straight with you .
i 'm gonna need you to address me as sir or officer , understand ?
okay , good .
now , do ... do you want to tell me where it is ?
you don 't have any money ?
i don 't know .
i don 't know why .
this isn 't the easy way out of this , you understand ?
this is confidential information . okay ?
we 're hoping that if we can find the money that she stole ,
and here 's the most important thing .
that 's why it 's important you take them to the car
yes .
sandra ! are you or marti gonna come help ?
okay , one of us will be right out .
oh , my god .
should i have my people start watching him ?
oh , goodness , no . no , no , no . nothing like that , no .
yeah , he does , like you can 't imagine .
oh , hey , listen . kevin said that you told him about becky 's brother
i don 't think i said much , though , did i ?
the last thing i need
if you can 't cooperate with me here ..
i need to be able to trust you .
i 'm very sorry ..
that fall under shit that ain 't none of my business .
what 's it look like from there , evan ?
come on .
nothing .
we 're just waiting . that 's all .
w-when are they coming ?
well , let me talk to him , then .
hello , officer daniels . how is it going ?
yeah , i 'm busy as ever .
sandra , you gotta help me .
can you see i 'm on the phone ? sit down !
oh , yeah . he b-heb been great .
sounds good .
okay .
what are you ... what are you doing , honey ?
stop talking .
hello . this is van .
sounds like sandra 's running around
yes , i 'm sure it 's busy in there .
is sandra still in there ?
you have one minute left on this card .
what do you want me to do ?
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
you know ?
can you tell her that ?
can you put her on for me ?
i didn 't do anything , sir .
that all this would be hard on her ? did we not ?
what about me , rebecca ?
you think i like situations like this ?
see ? shut up , kevin .
sandra ? from the south end store ?
i 'm sorry . what happened ?
the officer said you 'd been talking to him .
i 've got that thing going around .
i haven 't talked to anybody today .
is everything okay ?
hey , you okay ?
yes , i 'll have an original chickwich ,
its officer daniels , messing with ya .
i was doing what i thought was the right thing .
take a girl 's clothes away
did you know that the police station was only a half-mile away ?
and i asked him .
and yet he never came , and that didn 't make you suspicious ?
he had an answer every time that i asked a question .
were you brainwashed ?
private place .
i didn 't know you wrote stories
just to where you stopped . it was a good part too .
what thing would that be ?
the wood is from an island southwest o madeirg . "
no . the clues are all on that page .
" one day , into the room came a young man ,
then his wife must press them . men don 't have the talent
well , no .
it 's usually about his wife .
i prefer a cigar .
did you write such a story ?
i must finish with you before i die .
here .
i 'm going to need some help with the bees .
the armonica ?
he played it constantly till the day he died .
one hour per week .
why are you here , mr. kelmot ?
and it isn 't just the lessons
and i heard her saying , quite clearly .
trying to see if i can tell where i 've been .
mr. holmes can tell things like that
see to the bees !
got a letter from your aunt the other day .
need a housekeeper .
can 't stay here forever .
you said you never wore one .
she wanted the fictional . you are the real .
i think i was real once until tohn made me into fiction
i 'm actually quite fond of a pipe ,
i 've never had much use for imagination .
my father would bring me here as a child .
we walk as giants .
sherlock-san !
is this a metaphysical question ?
oh , i can 't say that i 've ever mourned the dead ,
logic is rare , and so ...
a few months ago , my brother mycroft died .
i was given a small chest containing the watson stories ,
but one of the titles piqued my interest .
but by a fortunate chance , an opportunity soon arose .
dear man , you should fear for your life .
murder , mr. kelmot . murder .
poisoned ?
but that night
so , i decided to write the story down on paper
you 're not going to die
i had a 6reat uncle who lived to be 102
i can 't
mr. holmes !
could have done .
he must have decided to take it subcutaneously .
ho . made sure of that , didn 't he ?
should be in hospital . that or one of them places .
and the day he does is the day we go .
got a letter from japan .
have you read it ?
sin of desire . youl 're a catholic .
and why do you think that is ?
if you read their letters , you 'd want to help .
it 's just if i were to read them ,
oh . i 'll never go back to japan .
long journey , old man .
the crime wave that has done away
mum , wait .
i 'm sure your mother doesn 't need to be told where she 's been .
it 's not foolishness . here .
do it
turn in a circle .
the soot on your dress attests that you went by train to portsmouth ,
wished to make a favourable impression .
there is no shame in what i do !
and you wish you had it better !
go after her .
your dad hated what he did for a living .
when he got called up , he said to me ,
blown out of the sky . first time up .
i shouldn 't have said what i said
in your desk .
didn 't know it was a desk until i opened it .
he left it at baker street when he went off to get married
yes , but in watson 's story , he does have the armonica in it .
so maybe he did get things right .
john had gone from baker street by then .
i don 't know ! and if i ever did know , i don 't remember .
and if i 'd brought it to a successful conclusion ,
i must have done something terribly wrong ..
one can 't solve everything
logic is rare .
they 're just on the other side of the wall .
ply your parlour tricks elsewhere , mr. holmes .
i don 't know much about your profession ,
to keep you from this appointment you seem so eager to make .
the man who took away the music you loved ,
and then i witnessed your actions .
a convincing set of circumstances ,
we must place blame on your husband for the first .
i would also make the observation that there is nothing about you
the second was unavoidable , and all the more damning .
everything about him , his clothes , the patches on his trousers ,
money must have been a dire necessity ,
for grace . for tames .
shock
no , no ! no , mrs. munro , no !
my son .... won 't wake .
they sent me away till morning .
didn 't think it would make a difference .
they 're all you care about !
i care about him very much .
the bees were not to blame
and he did . he found the wasps ' nest .
and so he did the worst possible thing .
how do you know it was them ?
there were no stings left in roger 's face .
i knew her less than a day .
she needed my help .
i watched her walk away .
well , that 's what the people like .
that 's what they want , my love .
it is not for me to question my gift ,
come here and give punch some love .
oh . come on
so blessed i am to have va .
there you go ! look at you
that thing does nothing but bellow
i thought for certain
i sank into it .
from over here
don 't rush me , and then
we 're about to be on the move .
we don 't got no space for nothing more .
she 's got skills in the theatre .
this puppet is broken . punch !
you can 't be dropping the puppets .
if you break this one 's face ,
if one thing ever
oh . well
when you 've lived as long as i have ,
someone is close to rousing the devil .
he 's right there watching the rehearsal .
but he was right there .
i would not do your stephen hawking impression in front of him .
that 's , obviously , amy 's incredible dress from their wedding .
and mark hamill officiated .
i do .
over here , the fencing outfit .
max , what is that thing that you have behind your back ?
yes , right here .
no , you 're watching an episode
you do so much with so little fabric .
and i see you took my advice and got polish vogue .
we are finally on a romantic date .
yah , now , he 's going to buy me something golden .
i want a golden shower .
some place with a lot of cash shoved up inside you .
well , let 's see . the wooden base of the cup is about this big ,
that 's like a million dollars !
well , we . we could have it .
and sold .
yes , we are .
i 'm hamish mcdonough , by the way .
we won 't speak of it ..
and if you ever need anything , don 't hesitate .
" just the two of us " antiques .
no , dear , i 'm not insane .
this is highly unorthodox , but i shall repeat the item .
do i hear 80,000 ?
80,000 going once , going twice ,
and the next item up for bid
kitsch is always a wild card , but it has no real value .
i won that when no one thought i could .
it 's worth something .
we start the bidding at $ 50 .
sir , it 's in increments of $ 10 .
sorry , the rainbow room really sucked me dry .
do i hear 60 ?
hamish came to play .
is that why it 's called a loving cup ?
do i hear 225 ?
i know you have no interest in what i would normally
look , katie holmes really wants this ,
200 going once , going twice .
did you just say " i 'm " ?
okay , before we use all this money on the business ,
how many calls ?
how do we know this guy 's
i 've had some filthy , filthy times in this state .
because that 's our only lead on this guy .
there were threats , you and lincoln might be kidnapped .
really .
she 'd been working in a madagascar rain forest ,
she 's on her way .
why 'd this guy call the club 's phone and not erica 's ?
what do you want with this guy ?
you did good .
oh , no .
my wallet .
we find her , we find our guy .
you keep that up and we 're not going to last here much longer .
he puts four enemies together , guaranteed dissension .
this is our guy 's girlfriend 's address .
this is tia .
someone else 's words heavily paraphrased .
i think you meant it as a metaphor .
which neatly
from 30 years ago .
just a few conversations .
i 've known your mother for years .
i 'm guessing this isn 't about my sense of humor .
but then she learned the truth .
and if my mother is so brilliant and active in the company ,
it can 't be managed by one person .
equally formidable , working in lockstep ?
that 's very good .
michael ..
this is just a stupid girl who dates a criminal .
a signature of burrows ' leadership .
my aim is true , don .
i 'll keep it in my pants , all right ?
aye. all right , burrows is out .
the company 's e-mailing tia 's credit card history .
a big ol ' goose egg .
i checked her e-mails and her web sites .
are you sure this girlfriend route is the way to go here ?
how long is it gonna take the company
you 're no longer in charge .
bad time ?
the second you stop doing what i tell you to do ,
it 's not gonna be the same .
why ? because two years later it was gone ?
so what are you suggesting ,
or wherever you like .
why ,
before you were incarcerated ,
you 'd sit for an hour .
when you 'd leave , you 'd take a flower
she 's seen the pain you carry .
all right !
the company can 't know i 'm talking to you .
do you want to find michael scofield ?
it 's 60 miles northeast
having lemonade .
that 's how they recruit .
clandestine warfare isn 't pretty ,
michael is the object of a quick and nasty
we need the footage from that security camera .
sure
a deal 's a deal , right ? not to be a broken record , but all i ask ..
the scofield / burrows family would have been a formidable asset to the
if , indeed , that 's what we 're dealing with .
do it now , doctor .
i want scofield pliable for transit .
and if we can 't revive him ?
make yourself a helmet , pal .
we pulled his image off the security tape .
that 's great , but that 's going to take all day .
we need to go now .
throw him a ball or something .
okay , on the count of 3 , cal .
oh . okay .
what the hell ? !
an angry stomach is 12 % larger .
but they 're undefeated .
not as long as you 've been sitting on that couch .
alex decided to take off some time earlier this summer ,
did you bring food ?
but they won 't be ready for six weeks .
well , i fell asleep on my phone ,
you go back to work in a few weeks .
uh , okay . sure .
can you scratch my nose ? i feel like you 're closer .
hey , gals , things haven 't been going that great
briny rogues !
will you get away with ya ?
and some of you are just fish i 've dressed up in a hat .
don 't forget polly .
polly , the finest parrot to sail the seven seas .
there 's still time to fill these chests with sparkling booty .
trophy ! trophy ! trophy !
let 's get after her , number two .
clap on all sail !
here we go , lads ! look and learn .
avast ! i 'm the pirate captain .
gold ? this is a plague boat , old man .
or my left .
minor hiccup , that last one .
i 'm the pirate captain , and i 'm here for your gold .
i 'm the pirate captain , and ..
pirate captain . blah , blah , blah , blah , gold .
sorry .
that 's nice .
no , not really , number two . no , i think i 've ...
i 'm hanging up my cutlass .
yeah , i was thinking i might go into baby clothes , actually .
i hear there 's a fortune to be made in baby clothes
and the running people through .
enjoy it ? you 're brilliant at it !
do you think so , number two ?
you 're more of a pirate than black bellamy or any of them .
that 's why the crew ,
what do you say ?
this is the one , lads !
well , don 't just sit there like lemons !
standard , sir ?
extra gruesome !
bold theory .
but to be honest , monkeys are 10 a penny .
anyhow , big day tomorrow .
let me show you to your room , captain .
now , here 's the plan .
wait until the bearded idiot is asleep ,
honestly , number two , what 's got into you ?
yes , but ...
a future pirate of the year needs his beauty sleep .
that 's lovely . now , that is lovely .
and just chuck in a few gulls , would you ?
give it up for the pirate captain !
nobody deserves this more than you .
and that beard of yours ,
give it back , bellamy , it 's mine !
neptune 's navel !
you are hereby banished from blood island !
and stay out !
we don 't need them and their stupid awards .
she gave half of us tetanus , for goodness sake .
well , you know , you should be happy for her .
eating gold bricks wrapped up in , you know , swans .
well , we 'll have an adventure
good old inseparable you and me .
like serrano ham and ,
and they are awfully fast .
and they 've got an awful ferocious bite .
knowing much about hippos until right now .
maybe if we could get through this quicker .
did you know that ? fascinating .
we should get out of here .
here 's another interesting fact .
ah ! come on . beat it !
just a bird , okay ? come on , get moving . get out of here .
beat it , bird .
it 's this stupid face you make .
there it is .
eddie , you okay ? you having a heart attack ?
yeah ?
i 've been training four hours a day for six months .
man , it is hot out here !
okay , okay , okay .
i know how to do that .
it means that she 's got a clue for you .
you got a clue for her .
she 's your ex-girlfriend . she 's the flame .
it 's not the moment for it . forget it .
look like your stomach is upset .
oh , man .
stealing makes me very uncomfortable ,
but you can 't get to it
don 't worry about it .
hold on . wait , wait . here we go .
you do not want a piece of him , milo , i 'm telling you .
so we have to get across. this .
we have to take our time , make careful decisions .
we start on that bridge there ,
maybe this character 's not totally worthless .
you 're too stubborn and pissed off .
what the hell you talking about ?
and i say this with all due respect , sir .
whoa .
we still have to find the jewel .
yeah , that 's how it works in these games .
go , milo !
bye-bye , mr. walker !
everybody should be so lucky to have a friend like milo .
hey , guys .

you 're lying
tason , other side of the stage .
jou 'll do the first block
people texting , instead of actually talking to each other .
they made a big deal of putting smartphones in blenders .
yeah . this guy , joel edmund , was with me for a year .
dm records . social media .
i am piin ,
that 's a difficult question , dr. tagger .
the bullet must have been laced with it
i 'm right here .
they 're afraid of technology
so , obviously , they 're not bis on logic

berlin , germany .
was that supposed to happen ?
guys , i 'm not sure we can do this , you know ?
all those in favor of believing in ourselves ,
and all those in favor of just giving up .
good . well , i 'm glad we made this decision .
so cool !
what ?
maybe along a deserted canal .
let the others know i 've gone , will you ?
what did you expect from world 's most dangerous frog
i think you mentioned that before .
we are now positioned to carry out greatest ..
of all time , and pin it on those gullible muppets ,
ensuring that my name goes down in history
of course .
you are forgetting one thing , small man with glasses .
all right !
won 't the show be terrible ? guys ?
i 'm not sure that was such a great show .
that jam was , like , totally epic .

keep your distance !
now he knows you 're for real .
that was such a big round for creed .
you woke up a sleeping giant .
he 's lucky to be in the same ring with you hitting him .
adonis creed has succeed in pressuring ricky conlan and making him fight .
but he does not look like a match ..
.. but you 're hurting him too . i can see it in his eyes .
shorten that jab , shorten the distance ...
you gotta push him back .

i 'm not angry with serge .
he 's a frightened , little , yellow-bellied coward .
well , you can say that about most anything . " it depends . " of course it depends .
yes , i suppose you 're right . of course it depends .
may i officiate , by the way ? the ceremony ?
i must say , i find that girl utterly delightful .
yet without question , without fail ,
because of her purity .
does she ? very much .
don 't flirt with her .
the envelope was found near the body , but its contents were missing

she left everything to monsieur gustave , of course
he was the same as his disciples ,
he did not succeed , however , in growing old .
she and our infant son would be killed two years later
in answer to your earlier question , by the way ,
i think i can say that .
although , i must say , he had an exceptional teacher .
how are the fellas making out ?
yes , sir .
and we have a frenchman , lieutenant jean-claude clermont ,
finally we have your sculptor , sergeant walter garfield .
hey , stokes !
hey , walter . how are they treating you ?
i don 't much fancy an obstacle course .
you 're just crawling on your belly while teenagers shoot blanks over your head .
how 's that ?
and no ? they 're not blanks .
try not to get shot in the meantime .
basic training will do that .
we have been tasked to find and protect
and richard , if you call me " private " again , i will take a shot at you .
we 'll ship out in the next few days .
so walk carefully , take no undue chances .
sarge , can you tell us where to find command and control ?

sunday , piano shopping with elton john .
oh . did you know , at the united nations ,
they exist in case we ever make contact with an alien civilization .
where 's the memo with what we do now ? ! "
wait a second .
it 's not a big deal .
that 's not the point .
now you 're just trying to take over the whole thing .
but someone joined our page .
so , listen to what he wrote .
you guys rock . "
yeah , we totally did .
p why can 't i recall this song ? b
we 'll keep rockin'
okay . i posted it .
let 's see . uh , his name is trent monaco .
he brews his own beer . he 's got awesome tattoos .
damn .
hey , trent just liked our comment .
no hard feelings ,
how does he keep coming up with new ways to be annoying ?
can you please go talk to him ?
once ? who got the gum out of his hair ?
fine .
oh , yeah , he got a tuba .
this is a thermostat .
the ideal setting is 72 degrees .
and at the children 's hospital until they asked us to leave .
really ? you want to go down there and meet him ?
i built a footprints on the moon fan page . trent joined it .
been a long time since i had a home-cooked meal .
not at first , no .
so , a little silver lining .
nothing takes the sting out of a shattered life
and pythagoras had an irrational fear of beans .
maybe he just had bread in his pocket .
painters like van gogh and pollock ,
it 's called " darlin " by the beach boys !
i 'm not crazy !
there goes our shot at him living on the roof .
so , should we introduce ourselves ?
i wonder if he 's listening to our music right now .
what a cool way for us to meet .
but few do it as well as bree hodge ...
or as politely .
there was a time when that phrase meant something on wisteria lane .
by wives who loved to cook .
but family dinners , like the times , had changed ,
she doesn 't like spring lamb .
i 'm glad you guys think it 's so funny that my life is over .
the man was your teacher and married .
don 't worry , dear .
when are you gonna take me seriously ?
she sleeps with them . that 's a start .
i hate all of you !
we 'll need them till a certain someone can be trusted with china again .
and then have the patience to wait while he figures out what the hell it is ?
thot 's fantastic ! what is it :
yeah , have at it .
okay , okay , i 'm dying here .
you 're eating it .
okay , well , we were there , and , uh ,
that 's how we got our song .
yes , see how much fun we were ?
i started to do this ....
oh , mike . come on , you 're not even trying to remember ! it was fun !
car wash talkin ' about the car wash , whoo ,
later that night , we did some things that , trust me , are worth remembering .
i think i missed something at the autopsy .
you always gotta come at lunch , don 't you ?
first i thought they were veins .
now what is it , dear ?
there 's no rush . she 's not trying that hard .
your sister tried to kill herself . that doesn 't upset you ?
how upset do you want me to be ?
is my daughter all right ?
the wounds are fairly superficial .
we 'll release her tonight ,
she says she only took three sedatives .
this was a cry for help , and if we don 't listen ,
suicide is the worst thing that can happen to a family !
orson 's right .
in fact , i say we all ... .
tom actually said he 's opening up a pizza parlor ?
nip it .. in .. the bud .
i don 't think so .
hey . julie .
generally , when you buy flowers , they don 't still have the roots on them .
hi , i 'm sarah .
hey .
oh , come on .
she 's in honolulu on vacation . can i help you ?
what 's that smell ?
i was hoping it would trigger mike 's memory .
you should 've refrigerated it .
oh , you know ms. britt ?
what is she doing here ?
you know , she was with him when he came out of his coma .
and she 's been here every day since .
hello , susan .
i 've been wondering why mike 's been so cold to me . now it all makes sense .
for god sakes , take a bath .
i don 't think you get to pull the " i know what 's best for me " card .
actually , i think we 're making great progress .
and you think your mother cares more about her image than your feelings .
don 't you know how much your mother loves you ?
how does that make you feel ?
powerful ?
of course not .
i can 't go through that again .
you said , " put it away . "
i kind of majored in not getting stabbed .
i 'll write your intro , but then you 're on your own .
so ..
one night , he pops her one , so i break a chair over his head , and , uh ...
but you were protecting her .
but the guy said he 'd leave if she didn 't press charges , and ..
you know what ?
why don 't you lay down for a couple minutes , and ...
carlos ...
gaby , can we talk for a sec ?
oh , phil , did you bring your suit ?
not in front of carlos-cay !
you know , if you were trying to hurt me , that 's not the way to do it .
how can i hit you so hard that you will never recover ?
oh , i have to , carlos .
we 're not good for each other , and i can 't keep doing this .
you proved something tonight .
julie , there you are .
let it go ! he 's not into you !
i made you some waffles .
that 's where i met jason .
pulling the trigger .
i 've come to give you my blessing .
yes , danielle made it quite clear that i 'm powerless to stop this relationship ,
good . then we 're all set .
i 'll bring her cds and her stuffed animals over tomorrow .
this place is kind of small .
oh , and i trust you to be discreet .
whoa , whoa , mrs. hodge ?
wait , you remember that ?
yes !
we 're gonna be us again !
mike ..
yeah . how about that , you knew my name !
so i shorted gas and went long on coal .
ames .
it reminds me of my humble beginnings .
just me , that computer .
you really did it all on your own .
now , listen , i want you to drop this " sir " nonsense .
i want you to call me " dad . "
my real father never had time for me .
of course , that was before
okay , then .
motherfucker .
with that rate of return , i could buy a new car every time it gets dirty
you see , i didn 't get to where i am today by asking for handouts .
and today , that hard work paid off .
just stay in county lines with that thing on .
son , i want you to stay strong . do you hear me ?
i 'll be so strong for you , dad .
i have to leave the country !
it 's like they don 't recognize you anymore .
alissa !
i know . what are you doing
l fucking kill you if you say anything
for the love of alan greenspan .
i venture you 've heard that i 'm going to prison .
come on . they 're probably sending you to some club fed prison .
babe . this does not make any sense .
because he thinks i went to prison , babe . that 's the part i don 't get .
he assumed it ?
so what reason did you give him to assume that you went to jail ?
this is nuts .
the problem is he is never going to believe that you went to jail .
you are not exactly a thug .
honestly , all i gotta do is change my voice , talk a little deeper .
just wondering if there 's any word from the investigators .
thank you . bye .
and i heard that you played at the party where he got arrested .
i don 't know how to explain what it 's like to take money from someone like that .
i don 't wanna do this anymore . let 's move on . okay ?
absolutely .
what the fuck are you doing , mam ?
you 're never getting out alive ! ha , ha .
release the dogs !
there 's nowhere to run , mr. tames .
you couldn 't get past cecelio and some chihuahuas .
that 's what happens when you try to jump a fence illegally . hm ?
come on . are we doing this or not , okay ?
hey , i was nervous the first time i did karaoke , right ?

james , don 't do nothing stupid . just dress casual .
what the hell are you doing ?
little wayne .
the more i read , the more i listened ...
that is really great . now , can we please be done with this conversation ?

damn . mayo is badass .
wall street , man . those are the real criminals .
wait , man . you murder people all the time , black .
and they think , " oh , please , don 't kill me . "

i 'm ... i 'm laughing .
youir boy , mayo , is an earner .
but mot with us . you know , inside it 's all about color .
dude need a white gang .
but i 'll put the play together .
they seem kind of racist .
that 's the alliance of whites .
them believe that you 're one of them .
you know , you 're the best boyfriend i never had .
yeah , well , i 'm not totally giving up . there is time .
no , no , they don 't .
you say that now . no , no , no . i 'm always gonna say that .
private club , jew hair .
i walked right into that one . heh .
but russell , from the crenshaw kings , referred me ?
anyway , i 'm going to prison and i need protection .
oh , god .
i 'm just wondering if maybe i 'm not the best fit for the alliance of whites .
fine ! 20 ahead !
we are
he 's keeping me up to date . but the million-dollar question is :
i don 't expect you to get it on the first pass , so listen very carefully .
okay ?
okay , how do we get it ?
you got to be the dumbest genius i 've .. get ud , james !
all right .
we 're going to martin 's office .
look , you saved my life .

james , what are you doing ?
my life 's asshole is fucked !
you just remember :
to jail , but i did my job . i got you ready !
maximum-bullshit prison ?
i don 't even give a shit .
the money for education or a first home .
i 'm rolling .
once you step through this threshold , motherfuckers are ready to kill for you .
but there 's only one way out of this .
so from this day forward
and for one brief moment , i knew what my purpose was .
not to mention russell .
hey ...
thanks for not doing nothing stupid , man . let 's get out of here .
i figured out that the residue on martin 's car was saltwater .
turns out that 's the exact distance of a round-trip to san pedro .
pedro . that 's the only thing i don 't know .
it 's docked at the port .
fucking working for a villain in a james bond movie !
not if mayo can stop him .
" chocolat " ?
is that supposed to be my nickname ? that 's your nickname .
your son-in-law with , sick son of a bitch .
james , you realize that i didn 't mean to hurt you .
and i had to get the money from somewhere . i had no choice . it was you or me .
james , fuck him . we 're leaving
oh , my damn .
i am genuinely sorry it had to end this way .
you ain 't got to do this , man .
well , dad , looks like you thought of everything , didn 't you ?
except you forgot one little detail
ew . that 's right . nuts and butts .
you point at him . i 'll point at martin .
ball 's in your court , gayle .
know .
where did you put ... ? that was in your ass . that was in your ass .
with evidence and obstruction of justice
so i guess we did it .
thank god we won 't be needing this anymore .
okay , you should really get rid of that thing .
suck it , general .
what ? leaving me
you 're a coward !
you think gretchen and bagwell are gonna get you scylla ,
don 't tell him anything !
be quiet ! don 't tell me
we needed him .
all right , just go get gretchen and bagwell .
i don 't know how things worked back home ,
susan anthony .
are you a prospective client ?
she 's a pretty convincing salesman herself .
where did you work together ?
weren 't you in the northeast division ?
but my very first job with gate was , uh ,
you 're not even close to getting out of here .
you sure , papi ?
yeah , but we don 't know what 's be up there
best of luck .
there 's no way this is gonna end well .
don 't you think it 's worth 20 minutes for $ 125 million ?
i want a team outside of the general 's office .
check the elevator .
all that design just to hold some names and reports .
we can 't veer from the plan here .
yes , sir .
i know .
i was wrong .
what is it you all want ?
just say the word ,
you think you can just
okay , ma 'am .
down on the ground , men and women are dying
turn around .
you should 've let me try to convince mr. white
what ? ! put on a monkey suit every day
let 's go .
sara will be keeping your daughter in custody
they 're in local law enforcement , hospitals , dmv .
actually , once we get scylla into the right hands ,
don 't you forget that , old man .
he was an executioner .
now the men he trained will be coming after you .
mrs. tabak ? !
get this to an agent schmidt .
i wish i could drive you myself ,
yeah , i 'm okay .
he needs to go to a hospital .
you 're going to get the best medical care available .
no , i should be thanking you .
listen , i need a , uh , ambulance to come with the convoy .
sir ?
i don 't know .
that 's the most important thing .
you 're gonna make it , michael .
sorry , i still can 't believe it .
all right , dylan , was your girlfriend in bed alone ?
must 've fallen asleep . and by the time i woke up , she 's ..
but , you see , the thing about people burning to death
and also , you know , people don 't sleep in the middle
so , you gotta understand a curious person like me is left wondering
then used the ducts to get through the house .
breaker didn 't trip .
set wrong , it could cause a power surge and overload the mechanism .
now , if the heat source came from within the cable
somebody splashed it .
chief mccaffrey , is he your uncle ?
what do we got ? or not ?
we got five males all under 15 .
in the prelim opinion of the me , the fire killed them .
or , uh , you , to be exact .
what do you think , sean ? murder ?
but i gotta tell you , i 'm gonna have a hard time calling " accidental " on this .
not the mayor , who 's already got
no , i think it 's safe to say
he couldn 't pour piss out of a turnout boot
the hunters , rod and jan , married , no kids .
i 'll tell you what we 're not gonna do .
nobody utters the " a " word , got it ?
there 's maybe a gang hitting houses in the area .
you id the car , you move .
mmm . sure .
maggie rening .
but you still won 't come .
you scare him , you know .
that old man .
i come here all the time .
what are you doing , huh ?
so , you start in the air con unit ,
you 're hungry . you know it 's bait , but you bite .
but you never managed a gulp of air .
you should 've gotten around a window ,
there have been quality control issues over quality species .
they 're in trouble , they 're not .
we 've been over this with the police
did rodger huniter normally spend a lot of time at the office ?
it 's his company .
i can 't get into specifics .
omn the missile 's seeker head optics .
and there was the fire , of course .
on our test bed .
unfortunately , a fire broke out after hours
next-gen seeker heads could take out any peer air force fighter .
a lot of alarm bells went off in the pentagon after the fire .
there wasn 't much , but enough to spot
soon as she realizes dod isn 't buying the switch ,
so , uh , hunter handed over the missile to these middlemen ?
she promised us all the evidence
so , our unsavory middlemen probably paid rod
but given their bodies were only dumped today .
they had to be sure .
if so , we want their guard down enough
i wanna catch the assholes that did it .
oh , and i suppose it not being arson spares the dod
that 's the best this job ever gets . trust me , i know .
until it did .
but in the moment ,
what the hell is wrong with you ?
i suck at being a fireman .
i 'll never have my grandfather 's sense of duty
get back in the game . let 's go .
that was a coordinated attack
we can 't leave our men behind
let 's go .
we 're box kickers , not a fire team .
go pull li 's dog tags .
everything 's shot up or blown up .
she must make some kinda juice to have seals come extract her .
think i can hit that
tough day , bro ?
don 't do this to yourself , man .
to punish me .
sharia law as interpreted by the taliban forbids women to have an education .
when i returned to afghanistan ,
then i would be a martyr .
i 'm sorry .
get down ! get down !
the sun 's reflecting off his optics .
he 's far . danni ?
can you take him ?
all right , so what do we do ?
that would be choice number one ,
exactly .
well , merrimette , we can sit here and wait until one of them shoots one of us .
you and me .
man , always sitting and babysitting the muji .
yes , sir .
i want you to stay behind me and just be patient . all right ?
you all right ? yeah .
i want you to start movin ' forward
no . i move better alone .
when you see me hit him ,
see you in a minute .
good job .
it 's him or you .
before yesterday , i ..
and i never thought i 'd have to do it that close
today was a good day .
let 's go .
thank you .
may i ask where did you learn ?
may i ask the same of you ?
move , marines ! move ! move !
get down ! get down in it !
watch your six !
chief !
get me a poppy . a poppy .
thank you .
we need to make arrangements with our base so they can come get us .
it looks like everyone 's clearing out , corporal .
still got that video camera in that window though .
stay sharp , buddy . roger that .
well , just stay on him , all right ?
hey , corporal ? what 's up ?
they 're on the other side of the sandstorm and they got access .
i 'm afraid so
anoush hassan ? i know the name . vho is she ?
she 's a real hero to the people in the provinces .
the taliban wants her dead , sir .
yup . she 's good fr .
bead marines are bad pr
danni , get on that front window !
i 'm working on it !
i got it .
i 'm crossing . i 'm crossing . all right .
reloading !
move or die , marines . a-slash , let 's roll out .
sometimes . with my little girl .
we 're going after her .
you ready to die for this chick ?
that chick inspired the nation .
soldiers and bullets and fighting will never save my country .
it is a beautiful country . i wish you could see it the way i do .
only one place . to mullah nafiz .
you know how to get to this nafiz guy ?
listen to me , man .
so do i .
but you need to ask yourself if you are ready to live
we 're the tip of the spear .
we go in at dawn during morning prayer .
we can 't go in through the front door .
once we 're inside , where 's she gonna be ?
then we fight .
that means no gunfire until it 's absolutely necessary .
kill your lights .
take the door , a-slash .
oh , hello , darling . hello .
i mean , how can you cook without olive oil ,
hello .
vanna sit over there ?
like , uh ... i 've only got water .
okay .
i know what i think you might like .
no . i picked him up in an alleyway .
could you just stop with the arabic long enough
it 's the only thing he has in his life he hasn 't lost .
i can 't leave him in the shelter alone .
well , what about his father ?
and they were going to give him to child services .
so , he 's staying the night here ?
when you were in hospital with pneumonia ,
we didn 't catch it in time .
oh , god .
oh , god . jane , what are you putting yourself into the middle of ?
" daddy . i forgive you , if you give me one good reason to " ?
you know what i did for years ?
they 'd walk up to me , and the little girl would be ...
and she 'd say ...
i love you so much .
sorry .
it would be great if you 'd just not do that .
just a habit , you know ?
actually , i 'm a reporter , kind of , you know ,
no big magazine would hire me
but i think a v.a.t.s. makes more sense .
but let dr. thomas tell you about this story first .
how about i scrub in with you
i 've done one . three in fact .
it 's even better .
my ambulance isn 't here yet .
the patient was 66 .
just wanted to let you know , we 're all set for tonight .
i don 't .
it 's a very big deal .
yeah , i know , ' cause i cleared you ,
okay .
it is a big deal .
that 's not the point .
i 've been practicing for weeks . i feel good .
why ?
because everyone in this frozen tundra
i 'm trying to take notes .
he 's just poking holes
i just wish you were gonna be here .
wanted to make sure i had people around me tonight .
you 're headed to ?
that 's right .
so is this , by the way . hunt 's been filling me in .
we brought over 32 kids from 5 different countries in africa .
we operate on sick orphans .
not to worry .
the program will continue , just ..
if you 'll excuse me , i 'm trying to close on a house .
torres .
okay . i had a little to do with this .
it 's really no big deal .
you have to say it .
there 's no way she pulls this off .
do you think medusa 's always been medusa ?
yeah , but ..
it 's like she can hear us .
means the intercom is on .
i don 't think that you 're a demon .
there it is .
god , i needed this .
nelson is on standby . let 's have him come finish .
okay , we 're all doctors here . you don 't need to say this .
i say it because even if you think you 're prepared
but by saying this ...
so ...
and you guys , why do you have to laugh at every little thing ? !
the ant 's persistence gives her strength ..
see , let me be honest .
i got it right no ?
so let 's start with that ?
it 's a neurological disorder .
it gives small shocks ... like that .
ma 'am , what 's your ring tone ?
1 , 2 cha cha cha ... 3 , 4 , cha cha cha . !
you think they also have tourette 's ? !
force-mass x acceleration .
walking , sitting , getting up , running we learn all of this early on .
ma 'am , if we know everything already ...
i can walk in a straight line anytime .
shouldn 't you be in class ?
you 're not getting what i 'm trying to say .
basically , i 'm not the only one with tourette 's over here .
your tourette 's theory is cute , but practical life is quite different .
it 's just a badge !
you can be your own badge if you want .
what equal opportunities ma 'am ?
and ma 'am , we need to stand in a 50 meter long line , just to take a dump !
sir , you wanted to see me ?
so today , ravinder will teach the class .
if you don 't mind me asking .
thousand ?
i was wondering if you could teach all of us .
use it wisely .
maybe a graduate degree ?
i don 't want to sell no detergents ma 'am !
you wanna bet , learn to bet legally .
you mad or what ?
what for ?
oh ! it 's from the prefect badge !
you saying akshay is wadia 's bride ?
like you kiss my bum ! "
'9a will never accept us ' ?
what will you say anyway ? !
you 'll hiccup 4 times before you say 2 words .
you two , go to class , go to class right now !
i 've never raised my hand on a student till date .
am glad you 've finally realized it .
sir .
today will be 9f 's last day , in this school .
it took 6 months to make that project .
maybe dad and wadia sir are right .

the great ms. mathur 's subjects ? magic .
or cheated hard ?
if there are workings , they 're not part of the syllabus .
this can only happen , if you know the questions , and the answers are rote .
but that doesn 't mean 9f has cheated .
why is only your method correct ? or is that written in the syllabus also ?

oh , just to be clear ,
i got it .
we .. we get it ,
i 'm the one who screwed up .
she 's bad . you 're good .
this is all my fault .
so you 're saying you still want to get married ?
i don 't think she wants to marry me .
she deserves someone better .
you 're a good man .
and leonard just stood there with a big , dumb smile on his face ,
it 's not flattering . it 's creepy .
you know , just the other night , sheldon said that my feet
so leonard 's really considering this ?
he said , well , if i don 't want to have his baby ,
well , there is a deep-seated biological drive
so you 're on his side ?
but viewing him as your husband , he stinks .
really ? zack wanted you to donate
and they were gonna pay us , and penny freaked out about it .
i know .
yes , sheldon , they wanted me .
i 'm smart . i 'm nice .
as a donor i want to

with the investment you 've made ,
bricks ! who said fly repellant ?
you were right !
sorry buddy ! i didn 't believe you .

only micro artists can create such minute articles .

i couldn 't imagine what was going on inside eve 's magic sack
enzo , slow down , it 's your only one .
hey , what if you came with me ? huh ?
denny . i 'm not driving to florida .
there is nothing to debate here . this is your shot .
oh , you 're not worried about timing , at all ?
i didn 't know a human could make such sounds . the triple crown of ...
denny swift in the 22 car putting in a tremendous performance ,
approaching hour 17 of this marathon race , and the rain is really pouring .
just keep pushing , okay ?
one more push .
i watched some of that race of yours , by the way .
we 've had this conversation before .
say , for instance . you get seriously injured ,
what are you doing ?
i should 've destroyed the demon when i had the chance .
i 'm so sorry , enz .
you 're a tough old dog .
i won , by the way .
first overall .
oh , my god , denny !
i 'm so proud of you .
yeah , go to all the races and everything ?
a driver who cannot tear his gaze from the wall will inevitably meet that wall .
what the hell is that supposed to mean ?
maybe if you 'd been around more , you 'd have noticed something was wrong .
that 's not true !
a dog can power down his psyche and slow his metabolism .
a dog can change the tempo of the world , but people are at its mercy .
the dog . zoe 's been asking her grandparents to see the dog .
tell her he 's been staying at mike 's
what happened ? i thought they were keeping him until tonight .

i didn 't realize just how much i 'd missed it .
all right , let 's checker the session , clear the track !
hey , denny , got a minute ?
luca !
good to see you .
he 's visiting us from italy .
i would like to offer you a job .
you 'd be testing the cars .
there are certain things that keep me from leaving the country right now .
but if your situation should change ,
thank you , sir .
he 's asked about you over the years .
all i know is , he respects how you 're fighting for your daughter .
there 's no dishonor in losing the race ,
that 's where you belong .
ninety days seemed an eternity , even for me .
i do have some cash . i have ...
i can go to the bank first thing in the morning and bring the rest by then .
write a receipt for the 300 ,
thank you .
the medication kept me in a near-constant dream state for weeks
it 's not for me to say whether it 's the right decision or not .
me , too .
the visitation schedule will be as we discussed .
but what about the charges ?
like i said , denny , we had leverage .
it was a sound i recognized .
this is it , enz .

yeah , nothing like deceiving cosmo to work up an appetite .
kate just said that she wanted a good story , okay ?
yeah , i know . i think i heard the climax last night .
i hear you , but it 's fine .

i 'm the other hot girl at thompson fulworth ,
i 'm thinking about it . okay , friends share , so you don 't get this anymore .
as i 'm sure you all know , our internal review with mr. belmont is on the 27th ,

after all , he was just giving me what i wanted .
i 'm getting way off the subject ..
we look at it .
and on this last one ,
what 's wrong with the girls in this place ?
we didn 't catch it in time .
we can 't afford to be the people that stood by and did nothing
girl 's just under eight months pregnant .

words of a hero .
i just ...
even if i go , my mind will be here .
and if that virus gets out because i put my family ...
well , you know ... we do have a team here .
right ..
why are you any more expendable than them ?
you telling me you didn 't cut people because
i 'm going to need you train them with the wrangling equipment .
i would worry more about how they are gonna handle those racal suits .
and you 're just telling me this now ?
peter is gone .
i think he left the base .
ben ,
does anyone else know ?
plus , you need us in bl4 .
you lock the door . you don 't go home .
i will handle the colonel .
i don 't like any of this .
he 's the only one that 's worked with ebola in the field .
i mean , that was reckless , jerry !
she 's worked harder than anyone to get to where she is .
jerry !
it 's unclear how the virus is spreading .
but those could be carried from the pressure washers that

and to make things harder , the animals haven 't been fed since yesterday ,
to save li without handing whistler over .
i know .

she found the bomb , linc .
how did she find the bomb , sucre ?

the corporations who run them have interests here .
then we build them power plants ,
it 's all a fuck job .
and they were right .
they 're just trying to protect their children ,
least i can do is get you out of the bloody place .
looks like dog .
they need your strength too , mate .
obsessed with restoring natural order .
titan dna .
are you kidding , martinez ?
at 0500 , we 'll ship out to launch a joint operation ...
excuse me ?
uh , mark , why don 't we let colonel foster finish ..
look , they 've already got emma and the orca .
the mass extinction we feared has already begun .
we are the infection .
its original and rightful rulers ,
a way to protect the planet , to maintain its balance .
and within our lifetime , our planet will perish ,
and what 's gonna be left , if you do this ?
no , doctor stanton ,
i 'm guessing you weren 't expecting these guys .
all under attack .
now as before , we have been trying to lure
can you track him ?
but maybe she can .
why ?
this category six hurricane over d.c .
working with all four branches of the military ,
what do those nerds think they 're gonna do
they wanna bring godzilla back from the dead .
appreciate it .
the greater boston area
i repeat , all citizens
and with d.c. hit hard by a category six hurricane
and though this sight is heartbreaking ,
why ?
that 's how she made the signal for the orca .
well , that makes sense .
yeah , that 's real poetic . now what ?
what about moe , larry , and curly over here ?
oh , boy . godzilla 's radiation levels
what do you mean ?
okay , guys , you need to find the orca ,
wherever you feel happy , that 's your home .
lock all this all in your heart .
boys , listen to me .
and quite a change from africa , i shouldn 't wonder .
isn 't that right , boys ?
been difficult to place , have they ?
they don 't have any women in them .
i 'm talking about plump , red-blooded women .
the women of southern europe .
robbie , are you incapable of sitting in silence ?
oh , for god 's sake .
you will lose this game because of me .
i 'm reading about the realm of the dead .
see what i mean ?
illness , old age .
now , that 's an idea i can get behind .
not literally .
but what is within my power is to decide how i live .
madam . my lady of the lake , the bearer of my dreams .
we should form a club .
a brotherhood .
a tea drinking club , sounds like something my stepmother would go to .
it doesn 't sound any better just because you repeated it .
that sounds like a circus act .
barrovians .
i think that 's far too long .
there 's a word in old german , it has no translation in english ,
literally , " dragon food . "
it starts with a ring ,
still helheimr .
right , i need a drink .
hold the door , george .
they 're speaking to the rector in the morning .
language is never nonsense .
history . layer upon layer upon layer .
merely a sound .
with a good deal more economy , i shouldn 't wonder .
you should take a look .
tell them professor wright sent you .
that 's not the point .
git .
some call me gentleman dave .
you 're gonna have to forgive my compatriots .
i had the good fortune
may i ask what brings you to fowler ?
i 'm hoping there won 't be any trouble .
i don 't recall things being so prosperous .
mr. mccurdy ,
is he gonna be a problem ?
i 'm not asking you .
that doesn 't mean he can 't put one on .
it could be a problem .
why don 't you just leave all that to me ?
all right .
if i had not believed that i would see .
be of good courage
i 'd never lie to you .
recall you saying something about coming back after the war .
maybe after i get settled we could ride out to the bluffs like we used to .
what i 'm saying is ... it looks like a more aggressive approach
from what i heard , peterson was holding a shotgun .
what the fuck did ya think was gonna happen , dave ?
you think i brought you here to sweet-talk folk off their land ?
i want frank to take care of things when it comes to the farms .
he 's my friend .
welcome , gentleman .
you must be really thirsty to be drinking in my place .
i heard about what happened on the street .
i believe i have a proposal which might be of benefit to both of us .
i 'd like to think so .
do you think there 's a place for men like us to go ,
after the war i swore to myself i 'd never pick up a gun again .
i suppose .
without a doubt , shiloh .
that first day at owl creek i lost a lot of good friends .
of whom shall i be afraid ?
lead me in a smooth path because of my enemies .
and such as breathe out .
i would have lost heart ..
wait for the lord .
and he shall strengthen your heart .
amen .
hey .
thank you .
you stay away from her .
i 'm not one who holds high principles , but when a man shakes my hand .
now you be here before the end of business tuesday
make my purpose a little more clear to me .
town to town .
been riding hard , went in the saloon for a drink .
told him to pick up his partner and get .
but i didn 't .
and sure enough ..
shot out my horse . i drew my pistol . i fired back .
in the middle of all of it one of my shots went wide ,
then her husband come out .
i killed a boy , pop .
he just lay there dead ' cause of what i 'd done . just like william did .
you told me not to take him down to the river .
it was an accident . tragic , but an accident .
you can 't be too careful
the culprits had rolled away the lot ,
the anglican times , they don 't lie .
the working class .
you know where ive been , mother ; spent the day working .
old trafford
oh , i 'll be the judge of that . let me see .
ah , now then .

a railway arch , a stone viaduct .

mr l.s. lowry .
you 've really excelled yourself this evening .
an acceptance of who she was .
beautiful
no wonder you 've never had a girlfriend .
yes it has .
i did a sketch of her on the back of an envelope ,
mother . thought might like to paint her one day .
the woman belongs in a circus freak show ,
you know , something tasteful ?
bowl of fruit would be a great improvement .
still life
oh no , don 't be ridiculous .
they 're not just pictures of factories , mills , and streets , mother .
it 's made up of me .
i 'm compelled to put down everything
and the scent of lavender soap on people 's skin .
i cannot abide ugliness .
i 've never stepped near the mill in my life .
there 's a mill across the street , mother . and around the corner
we 're part of it , mother .
where is the beauty ?
ivory black , vermillion , prussian blue , yellow ochre .
laurie !
laurie i 've fallen out of bed !
you come and pick me up !
i 'm going to burn them , mother .

yeah . i guess so .
you were probably just having a bad dream .
it 's okay . just go back to sleep .
toxic lunar vibrations .
i 'm leaving your money here .
okay , fern . see you tomorrow .
that girl 's part mexican .
i have an affinity for mexicans . they 're , like , my favorite people .
okay , ronnie , then you should be the one to inform them

well , i 'm sorry about that , danny . they could be hiding .
yeah .
they said , " i heard you had a lot of zombies around here , "
melville .

" yes , one might question the $ 20 billion
do you have any alcohol around here ?
oh , but i do have several bottles of romulan ale
first , physics , now romulan ale .
you know what he said to me ?
what a dick .
you should be able to brag about your accomplishments once in a while .
i mean , the guys are never shy about bragging .
has he ever called you to tell you
physics is all we 're cut out for .
i don 't know . popular ?
there 's lots of things i could use this brain for .
i could guess people 's weight at the fair .
is it ?
okay .
your lives are not wasted .
you just hit a rough patch .
how ?
right there
can we go ?
if you uh ...
is there someone in there that made you want to leave ?
you said you saw a 6irl in yellow dress .
i 'm sorry .
i 'm not going to hurt you .
you 're not going to believe me .
this thing
and i pass it to you .
it could look like someone you know .
whatever helps it to get close to you .
but there is only one of it .
and sometimes .
should i , after tea and cakes and ices
hello ?
and she 's staring at me .
did you know her ?
i didn 't go back to class .
hugh told me that .
he said it was going to follow me .

why don 't you to-do that ?
what 're we tearing up ?
hi , andy . that 's so sweet and dirty .
well , here they are . 60 rat traps .
i don 't want to interfere with your business ,

no worries .
i can 't believe you didn 't just shoot a blood clot
yeah , and i 'm-i 'm gonna take this ,
what ? did you see it ?
oh you 'd know so . it has a saddle .
he just opened the door with the strength of his whiskers .
oh , what should we do ?
he doesn 't have a gun .
we 've all gotten someone an enema in the middle of the night ,
beat me to it .
you know what has to happen .
oh . that 's all ? good .
we could have ruth clean it
she was supposed to be here an hour ago .
why are you so interested in where she is , what she 's doing ?
max , i don 't want to make a purse out of her skin .
never mind . i 'll just text her .
don 't delete any of my penis with a hat pictures .
oleg will always pose again .
" where are you ? we needed you here yesterday . "
look at that .
given the dual nature of your crime ,
silence !
therefore , you shall be whipped ...
you may then spend the next 14 days in gaol ,
edward wild .
we was knocking down a wall .
a labourer .
no , sir .
it is not your pocket watch .
over a coat ?
it is our profound belief
we shan 't be denied any longer .
the water is rising .
the foam it swells , it swells all around them .
that 's what they said , didn 't they ?
but what did they talk about ?
hmm . talk , talk , talk .
we know he means the vote
.. what they was doing tonight .
all right , keep your hair on . i were just saying .
come on , george . come on , wake up .
what , the king ?
who 's going to lock up the king ? them three lads ?
and how 's the people going to do that ?
at least they 're doing something .
three thousand fools
a mere show of military might
they know not what they want .
innocent babes .
the rod is all they understand .
the labouring classes are ruled by their stomachs .
their hunger would be alleviated
this concerns not money .
this concerns neither liberty nor freedom .
so we 're all agreed . grand !
you will , i doubt not ,
and i rely with the utmost confidence
what ?
you saw orator hunt ?
aye , we saw him , we heard him and we were moved by him .
aye , at elephant and castle .
aye , ' ole families .
we 've to stand up for ourselves , esther .
i know , love , but we 've all got to be careful , though .
aye ?
it concerns the inalienable civil liberties
will you not be attending with her ?
mr hunt , please .
would you be so kind as to hold down my papers ?
now , on that subject , sir ..
mr johnson , will you show mr bamford the door ?
then let me speak to you man to man , mr bamford .
there are a large body of men signed up at manchester .
and it is them that i seek to protect .
a large body of men are signed up ,
but these are men who are not only
mr bamford , i understand your fears .
i have spoken at meetings in london
but the entire movement .
but this is lancashire , sir ,
richard , i 'm afraid we have agreed
this was last month . ii do not intend to repeat myself .
richardl , in manchester ,
i thank you for your pains .
i fear it greatly .
now you advise me how to behave .
well , perhaps you will allow me to travel with you tomorrow ?
so , lads , stay in your ranks !
and let 's shame them with our good conduct .
because what we want , it 's not theirs to give !
and with that in mind ,
these people are in a good mood .
in the presence of women , men behave-better .
we are their moral superiors .
well said , sir ! well said !
they are honest , gullible folk .
arrest hunt before he arrives in the field .
absolutely !
we are in charge , gentlemen ,
i am not disputing that , sir .
no , we didn 't think to .
well , do you want some bread ?
aye , go on .
that they have roundly failed !
this will not end well .
and they will continue to fail ..
you must be stiff after your journey .
stiff ...
indeed you did , my love .
you swim , don 't you , liverpool ?
ah . sidmouth ?
damn and blast this bloody business !
discretionary infraction .
to be honest ken was born for sebring .
you 're holding the ' 62 edition of the scca .
hey . hey , bill . what seems to be the problem , bill ?
hey ken , what happened to your shield ?
well , it looks like we 're about to begin .
the green flag is out
it takes something money can 't buy .
but it isn 't about speed , lee .
to win that race , you need a car
and that just gets you to the green flag
o away .
look , it 's not even a track , lee .
there 's no camber on the turns , no rails .
twenty-four hours lee
cars coming up on you out of nowhere .
maybe one of ' em is your friend . maybe ..
you 're exhausted , you 're hungry ...
and all of a sudden , you realize you 're doing 198 on a straight .
can i set your autograph , please ?
carroll , this is roy lunn .
oh , hell , i know roy . good to see you , roy .
we call it the beast .
well , it certainly wasn 't easy .
so , you already put that in a gt40 ?
i 'll be damned .
problems with the handling , especially the stopping
a pure racer behind the wheel of your car .
we think he may be too pure .
" too pure " ?
it means he 's all about himself .
well , look , you can get a clean-cut , all-american poster boy
so , you don 't agree with us on this issue ?
wedges . we put wedges in the suspension ...
you 're not coming . ken .
and bob bondurant .
it is their opinion that you are not a good image ,
and you 're the best man i got behind the wheel ..
the 22 or so other ford employees
you need one man in charge .
we still managed to put old mr. ferrari exactly where we want him
expand .
we haven 't worked out how to corner yet .
or stay on the ground .
in fact , the only thing that didn 't break was the brakes
now , in all his years of racing ..
he were alive to see this .
now , this is not a machine just anybody can get in and easily control .
i had no idea .
good timing .
shelby , you know i 've already appointed leo beebe director of racing .
now , you let ken miles race daytona
and if he doesn 't ?
lock , stock , and brand .
you wanker !
porsche number 58 with an unidentified ford
nice stopwatch .
ken miles in ford number 1
okay , sir . right away , sir .
it 's all quite humane , from what i 've been told .
it can be rather .. affecting .
most of them were miserable in their lives
we were just admiring this ledger from your latest success .
the house of abrasax continues to thrive ,
could it be success does not agree with you ?
could it be that failure agrees with you ?
no matter who or what he is .. he 's after our bounty .
we should warn lord dalem .
do you trust me ?
i understand , lady kalique
you believe the funters can be trus ed ?
i believe only in mutual self-interest .
malxe the deal
katherine ? everything all right ?
picked up a referral . a townhouse . but it has to be wednesday .
english , please . we use english in this house .
stalin ? ! i 'm stalin ? you don 't want the money .
good . thank you .
hey , cousin , speaking of money , i was wondering if ..
for what this time ? shoes ? a new phone ?
so , what , instead of feeling better , i should save my money and feel worse ?
i admit it 's none of my business ,
english .
you swore , no fighting at dinner .
no , you 're right .
we received an ftl from mr. wise . he says he has the girl .
then send the transport immediately .
what ? the gun .
careful . you 've been asleep for almost twelve hours .
okay , good .
you were still in the paper clinic gown .
look , jupiter .. is that your name ?
i was just trying to figure out what happened .
what are you saying ? i mean , yes , i used a false name , but .
what does that have to do with what happened to me ?
it can be difficult for terrsies , or people from underdeveloped worlds ,
protocol actually says
and they 're trying to kill me ?
please . this has to be a mistake
what ? are they gonna come after me again ?
hold on
the abrasax family ?
i don 't care who they are . you cannot just
that 's impossible .
wait , a bunch of people saw what happened . i mean , they can 't cover that up .
they blanked you .
oh , my god .
not a recode or a drop of juice in years .
hey ! hey !
your majesty .
i 'll go to town to pick up some groceries for dinner .
okay . all right .
it 's not pretty , is it ?
you still haven 't answered my question . do you want your wings back or not ?
the best bio-neural-synaptic prosthetic the military could buy .
sharing has never been the strong suit of your species , your majesty .
i mean , this thing was a cakewalk , right ? just like i said .
didn 't happen .
oh , no . i 'm really , really sorry .
someone got hurt .
oh , my god , i knew it . i can 't catch a break .
i don 't wanna be rude . wait , jupiter , we have to reschedule .
so we wait . they 're sending a cruiser .
we won 't last the night . we need a plan .
if she 's what you say she is ,
is he mad at me ? when he 's mad , you 'll know it .
caine is. complicated .
but a lycantant needs a pack .
alone , usually they waste away and die ,
caine was the best soldier i ever went into battle with .
marcellian cahun was her name . she loved bees .
my father would be freaking out right now .
i don 't think that most people would want to know the truth .
so , you 've been taught that the birthplace of the human race is earth ,
your planet was discovered during
obviously before any colonization
wait , are you saying your people killed the dinosaurs ?
come on .
human dna spliced with indigenous species
he has contacted the aegis . they are entering orbit now
i wish for you the life you 've always dreamed of .
your majesty .
for the time being , your majesty . the time being
yeah , i can 't touch this without a tax number from the revenue review .
we can 't get the title without the tax i. d .
i think you dropped something .
okay .
now , here is your code and conduct guide
yes ? okay .
and my deepest condolences .
i will never complain about the dmv ... ever again .
entitled to what ? like , free parking ? key to the city ?
it means your majesty 's life is gonna change .. if she wants it to .
just the " your majesty " part .
that 's interesting
i don 't know
welcome , your majesty .
you are aware that by detaining me without consent
i also know that i can file a tax grievance against you
i 'd like to go home .
set a course for earth . at once , my lord .
the aegis is involved now ,
her majesty is .. hardly detained .
dining with lord titus , of course .
your highness looks ravishing
please .
for that , i promised to return him to the deadland
i confess i feel i have you at somewhat of a disadvantage .
so close , in fact , that i could tell by the way she raised her eyebrows
just like her , always expecting the worst from people
you 're in love with mr. wise , aren 't you ?
why would she lie ? kalique is in competition with balem .
same can be said for you .
would have been just like them . and now ?
oh , my god . it 's all right . it 's all right .
she felt exactly as you do now .
i believe the same thing is about to happen to me
i needed someone i could trust
which brings us at last to my question .
a pleasure doing business with you , mr. apini .
unfortunately , my lord promised mr. wise that if he betrayed us
don 't sound like caine 's got a lot of time
you should have told me the truth about why you wanted her .
if i did , then jupiter would be dead and balem would still own the earth .
they are the source of meaning , of belief and hope .
i 'm particularly fond of the lies we tell ourselves .
given his history , i was advised to return him to the authorities .
and you still trust him .
why wouldn 't you tell me sooner ?
the original rite of pardon and reinstatement
to be fair , there was a time when i would have used something
goodbye , miss jones .
i 'll do it .
i need your help .
what happened ?
i love my daughter , caine .
you would have done the same .
here we go .
who are all these people ? just sims .
as i told you , these are matters of state ,
i , titus abrasax , take jupiter tones to be my wife .
would my liege place his hand here to receive the signifying bond ?
i 'm hit !
mom ? oh , god , no . nino ?
easy , dingo .
well , we can all only hope that they remain unharmed .
a transfer of title has already been processed .
we are aware of all current legalities .
what proposal ? you are to come with me to meet my lord .
you can 't do it , your majesty . you cannot trust these people .
you 're going to kill them if i don 't come with you .
he 's lying . you wound me , mr. wise .
no . she won 't be going anywhere with you .
to live ...
and this entire enterprise
to create profit .
i loved my mother .
my mother ..
it is better to accept this
how dare you ?
so i 'll say it for you .
who 's been searching for one thing his whole life
mr. wise , as a matter of public record ,
and i pray your aim is true .
and hereby return the title to its original heir ,
how long until you harvest the earth ?
but how long ?
remember why you 're here .
you can 't touch the earth , even if you kill me .
that planet belongs to me
you have no idea what you 're doing .
this is not a game .
if you do not seal .. beg pardon , my lord .
and i 'm gonna make you regret it .
signature unknown . attempting to lock in .
this is caine . yes !
caine , we can 't wait long ! give me every second you can .
okay , heh .
little bit of rough air .
yeah , yeah .
hey , we call that " turbulence , " all right ?
so sorry .
let me give you a hand .
harry , you took us up to 60,000 feet . what are you doing ?
i wanna thank you for going to bat for me last week .
you know , i 'll tell you one thing about the spanish women :
okay , baby .
oh , use the vitamix . the dry bit .
sheila .
i want to go to the movies with my friends .
it 's okay .
god , i 'm telling you , russ , you 've gotta get one of these go-kart kits .
oh , yeah .
we took her out this morning for the first time .
all your pictures were so great .
yeah .
what do you mean ? i just said i did .
okay , because look at this one . now , in this one we have ..
the four of us are gonna take a little trip .
hmm . no , much better .
what ? :
it wouldn 't hurt for the boys to learn to get along a little better .
yeah .
i 'd like to explore the real america , like jack kerouac or the merry pranksters .
ah . ow !
my trip to walley world when i was a kid was the best time i ever had .
don 't you think that 's gonna be kind of a letdown ?
for one thing , the original vacation had a boy and a girl . this one has two boys .
doesn 't matter .
come on , honey .
oh , what the heck , heh .
that 's the spirit .
ugh . fuck me .
not exactly .
oh , you wanted us to ?
go get packed . we 're hitting the road today .
guess we 're leaving today . all right . let 's go , guys .
well , uh , this is my dream journal ..
come on , honey . every boy that age has a stack of diaries .
two full tanks of gas .
yes , yes . roger that . okay .
well , we 're almost out of gas .
dad , what 's so special about walley world ?
uh , i don 't know . korean ?
the menu 's all in korean now . i don 't know what to press .
why don 't we just .. ?
you have to chug a big pitcher of beer .
and you did this ? because you hardly drink .
hi . would you like to donate to ass burgers ?
i was a tri-pi a long time ago , so ..
oh , my god . i can 't believe it .
heh . everybody sing it with me .
you became the light on the dark side of me
my eyes become large
he overcame lupus .
batman torever ?
a light hits the gloom on the gray
you gotta go faster , dad ! go faster !
um , honey , i don 't see any hot springs .
well , the guy also did not know he had a rat on his shoulder , so there 's that .
wow , honey , this is beautiful .
in your bathing suits . now ! heh .
i say we call it " griswold springs . "
oh , my god . it 's so nice .
oh , i don 't like that .
further out here than it does in chicago .
just messing with you .
yep , chuck was a good friend .
crying about the state of this country .
hmm . somehow i don 't see you crying , though , stone .
that 's kind of embarrassing , right ?
even the strongest faucet sometimes lets out a few drops , heh .
it 's looking good . ain 't it , honey ?
i liked working , baby . i didn 't mind it one bit
nope , never again . that is a promise .
i think it is so weird . i don 't know why you want to go back to walley world ..
audrey , dad flipped out because he loved us and wanted us to be close .
you 're such a clown .
you know , family is the most important thing there is .
maybe we 'll take baby cooper on a trip this summer .
because that 'd be stupid .
and then we get back i can maybe get a part-time job ?
you know , honey , i am really happy for your sister .
seriously .
these pants stone gave me are really stretched out in the crotch .
then how come the one night we 're with him ..
where 's your wedding ring ?
before we got here , you took off your wedding ring ?
he totally just came in here to show off his six-pack .
how come you gotta do this at 6 a.m .
for stone crandall 's accu weather report .
no , never have .
here it is .
i know , it 's so hot , right ?
i am hard as a faucet right now .
oh . no . i like it .
get down on the ground ! get down !
i 'm cooperating ! i 'm the one who 's cooperating !
get down on the ground !
i guess i 'm the asshole for trying to bring my family closer together .
russ ...
me . you think i 'm a loser regional pilot .
i get offers from international carriers all the time
i should take one of those jobs and fly off to the pyramids of zambezi .
just forget it .
you people are on your own .
this really hurts .
our luggage and all of our stuff was already stolen ..
even took my guitar .
a musician without his instrument is as bad as .
i mean , they always say " it 's not the destination , it 's the journey , " right ?
that 's what makes you appreciate the destination .
never let that go .
how would we even get to walley world ? we don 't have a car .
you leave that to me .
could i , uh , take the nissan ?
wait , dad , i thought we were going to the airport .
that 's not right . this sucks .
ha , ha .
you know , leonard , the more i think about it ,
who gets our beloved sword , longclaw ?
that seems fair ; we did just give you the painting .
well , no ,
you know what , sheldon , take it .
i really don 't care .
these items represent our shared times together .
leonard ....
he 's just gonna come up with some reason
sheldon , youre-you 're being a little selfish .
it 's not my fault i 'm bad at sharing ;
there is one thing i would like .
i would like to keep ...
but you don 't even like flags .
but i designed it .
but you don 't even understand its symbolism .
the-the field of blue represents you being miserable ,
i know when i 'm not wanted .
stuart , you cooked ?
there 's only three people in this house ,
you guys relax ,
it 's like we have a butler .
because i love howard and bernadette
why can 't there be four wheels ?
look-look , just come in and help me build a baby swing .
if you 're hungry you can eat your takeout ;
you want to come ?
hey , how you doing ?
when ?
what ? we 're getting married that sunday .
i-i can 't go to space .
i 'll call him back .
well , too bad , you already did . it 's a done deal .
no . that 's not how i want to start our marriage ,
but wh-what about all the plans and the guests ?
that happens to me every time i see a monkey wearing people clothes .
i used professional-grade makeup .
you 're the kind of person
as one does .
and my umbrella accidentally snagged the fire alarm .
but you didn 't !
mom ! you gotta stop doing this .
we get excited .
just like the starbucks girl
how hard is that to hear ? !
anyway , i 'll probably give it another 30 minutes ,
what are you laughing about ?
your poor , dumb dad .
that 's hilarious ! you sound just like him .
dude , " rich girl , " " sara smile ... "
it was scary how good they were .
yeah , he got lucky in the football pool once ,
right ?
not a single person even ...
wow . we 're coming back to that one .
hey , lil . could we talk to you for a second ?
oh , gosh , no . of course not , sweetie .
what do you mean , " used to " ?
much much are you not telling me ?
daddies took a little side trip .
um , so sometimes , uh ,
i 'll bet you do all right with the boys .
you just put it all right out there , don 't you ?
oh , my gosh .
no , but you know that 's a
it was great meeting you , jay .
look , d-dr . stark , i am feeling very sick today .
well , let 's see here .
you retaining control of your bowels ?
well , since hangovers are not contagious ,
uh , he was hospitalized late last year for exhaustion .
no , just rest . working too hard .
uh , he has a wife , four children ...
he 's more than my boss . he 's been , um ..
we 'll do everything we can .
all right , charge to 300 .
we 'll bring your baby up soon .
the donor was an adult ,
will dr.stark be splitting the liver in situ ?
we 'll find out for you .
yeah , you want to blow up
there you go . you got it . you got it .
they 've got a lot of questions .
did you ever hang glide ?
it 's apparently a very good way to become a liver donor .
okay .
listen , just hold their hands , let them feel smart ,
i said i don 't need any help .
wait . better yet , maybe you could , grey .
i mean , it 's gonna be hard for her
i 'll tell you when i know .
hey , i don 't tell you how to polish your sunglasses .
and it 'd be a shame if something like this
the last thing cristina wants is to talk to me .
please . was the tear in his artery
there is no way of knowing if that was the cause .
yes .
sorry . he was asking your state department .
which is why you might be more comfortable
i understand there are a lot of concerns
now we are out of time , which means we are out of options .
i can only say that if you knew me better ...
dr. hunt and i are going to operate ,
you have to tell them to stop .
i couldn 't have seen this coming .
you know what , shepherd ? i don 't need crap from you .
apparently , now i do , too .
right . well , like i said , no change .
i don 't have time .
i get it .
you 're content to stand back
suction .
hey , did stark ever respond to my page ?
one of them has just come yesterday .
he went back in lisa collins .
it 's a great idea .
we 'll see if it works .
it 's a great idea .
was it yours or dr. karev 's ?
and i 'm back , mrs. cortez . did you miss me ?
he won 't stop barking .
that artery is at the base of the heart .
no , i cannot manage this bleed on bypass .
i need you stop doing what you 're doing .
do it faster .
i need you to stop making this my fault .
figure it out ,
he actually gave me the idea . he was great today .
you know alex karev saved a baby 's life
yes , he did .
there has to be a way to find relief ..
it 'll make one .
how about you ?
he was adopted by a rich white lady
white people will adopt anything .
we take the j train to the 4 ,
no , but there 's a dicey underpass at grand central
me too .
excuse me , hi .
i 'm rhya , i 'm a little embarrassed .
han , you changed the price of tampons ?
no , this is not appropriate action .
look how old this machine is .
i 'm a businessman .
i do not belong in here .
don 't make me chase you , you little khaki mouse .
things like what ?
max , why are you so upset ?
ian , that 's a 200 % price hike .
you 're taking advantage of women .
hi , she has coupons .
should have told me before , now shouldn 't ya ?
now didn 't ya ?
lots of people use coupons .
chicken pot pies ?
what does it matter if i like them or not ?
it 's free money .
i don 't know about free money ,
it 's not a big deal .
" i 'm so lonely , i just tried smoking . "
and we cry .
so i did some research .
eh , i 'm gonna go with her way
ten cans , double coupon , five cents each .
oh , and i found a coupon for you to send your mom
and it 's for 40 % off the regular price .
and max , i do have something else for you in this bag .
canned yams for when i get tired of canned pumpkin ?
look out , han lee .
wrong with the current economy ,
oh , just putting straws in the container ...
just in case a woman might suddenly need a straw
they do not belong in public .
you can 't even say the name .
i will never speak of it .
that is inappropriate counter display .
you take down the price and i will .
i charge what i want .
in the lifetime movie version ,
i 'm sorry , but i just saw
ten minutes , in and out .
here , start going through these papers
i 'll give you $ 24 to stop saying cue-pon .
it 'll be a breeze .
the fact that you 're more worried about your coupons
max , it 's the williamsburg cue-pon queen .
this is so exciting . i have to go pay my respects .
just throw the cake mix into the cart
i 'll be right back .
i 'm caroline .
i 'm gonna lose ... my ... mind ...
i won 't bother you , but i think you 'll be excited

never again .
oh , sweet . how ?
and my dad thought he put it in ,
all right .
she placed 12th two years ago , 5th last year .
also , it is too late to change your bets
but if it can spell its own name , it can spell anything .
stay calm .
keep the recruiter 's face away from your junk .
okay ?
well , guilt is a blessing .
you can only go four minutes
well , we 'll need something stronger .

you got in a fight with a girl and you lost .

we do have one other option .
you 've come to me for help .
ycurse ' . i think it means " curse'
how do i get rid of one ? !
because your grandma put it on me !
not like a curse is such a big deal .
a curse is the universe trying to make you right a cosmic wrong .
and how do you know that ?
i can make no such promises .
what made you do this ?
like , maybe the universe wanted this to happen .
yeah , well , i am more romance , less body hair , so ..
if we stopped studying altogether and just did this .

well , just let me finish . angela isn 't ..
and now all i want to do is just sit.several feet away from

so , um .. you 're at that age .
dad , i 'd really be more comfortable talking to mom about this .
this one looks young .

don 't spell it till you know it .
oh , god . i can 't watch .
mnh-mnh . nope . i 'm not gonna watch it .
no , okay , you know what ? that 's really bad .
you must leave the stage .
i 've liked you since we first met .
it 's not surprising given
uh ... we ...
well , uh ... needless to say , it was some pretty kinky stuff .
and they were becoming a nightmare .
they love their country .
they support their favorite brand .
all right . i gotta run . i 'm meeting the girls for coffee .
which girls ? will bree be there :
wait . you were serious about us never speaking to bree again ?
yeah , i 'm serious .
if 's kind of a wreck .
you should go over and talk to paul . i 'll watch m.j .
um , i mean , he might be in the middle of something .
and would you mind closing that robe , please ?
i haven 't been getting out of the house much .
yes .
so if there 's nothing else ...
yes , susan . fit as a fiddle .
i 've already spotted two ex-senators
that 's a little trick i learned
i thought " flashpoint " was the best business book
we 're in for a treat tomorrow .
uh , lynette scavo .
oh . you 're a plus one .
unfortunately , it means you won 't be seeing chris cavanaugh .
i really want to see those seminars .
you are going to love what they have planned for us .
if i could have all of my plus ones find a buddy ,
gaby . what are you doing here ?
oh , she 's out of town .
you look good .
but i 've kept your secret .
it 's not really a good time to talk about that .
but i hope you 'll stop by my place sometime .
sure . i 'll do that .
haven 't you heard ? i 'm moving in next door .
just an old friend .
you never saw me . i have to go .
you love my sister , right ?
and you know paul young murdered her ?
oh , my god .
i thought you had a spa thing .
i wanna see chris cavanaugh .
the keynote speech isn 't for spouses .
activities that they plan for me ?
i 'm a grown-up .
come on . don 't you know how much i wanna see this guy ?
i don 't have any strings .
there you are . someone 's been naughty .
i think it 's somebody 's spa time .
so we don 't fight back .
okay . what did you talk about before you went to sleep ?
i mean , he 's not doing very well ,
the man 's wife died . you 're alive because of it .
mike really doesn 't want me to talk to him .
he said he was innocent , that he was a good man .
she fell in love with him ,
of course . she just said i didn 't know him like she did .
he said he 'd never loved her , that she was stupid
just like he knew she would .
i hope you 'll keep this story between us at least for now .
okay , but the one thing i don 't get
it 's too late for beth and my sister .
well , you 're not watching him alone ,
one more hand , and it would 've been perfect ,
he can sign those papers
i guess someone didn 't see the " no cell phones " sign .
i 'll talk to you later .
oh , ms. butler ?
yes , i 'm her . she 's me .
oh , we have a seat for you up front .
welcome , ladies and gentlemen .
it is now . please respect my privacy .
why ?
and okay , i 'm having dreams about us .
every step of the way .
first , i 'm gonna get some flour ,
maybe i should take my top off .
oh , and if you don 't taste the wine ,
had to be .. before mary alice died .
maybe we should start doing that again .
why are you doing this ?
okay , but while we are waiting ,
it is a sad day
cake 's ready .
one perfect pineapple upside down cake .
those are the robes of the jedi ,
so , you agree with my friends
yes .
well , maybe you should show her how ...
by seeing the movie she 'd want me to see ?
but you only have a limited number of days
you 're right .
hold on . it could be romantic .
no , no , no , no . she 'd be going alone .
okay , well , what 's the third option ?
you 're going into combat against a virus for whom
all right , listen up .
animals in there are hungry .
little guys don 't like the suits .
just primates who got involved in something they did not ask for .
to survive .
except it 's smarter and better at it than we are .
about an hour .
we need to get in and get out before anyone knows we 're there .
got word from dixon .
this is colonel jaax .
it 's possible reston is out of range , sir .
this isn 't something we wait on .
express orders to avoid exposure .
nancy understands the urgency ...

oh , my god .
i blame the hat .
lord badgley .
i come from the house of lords .

clear ? yes , i 'll see to it .
jip , you need to stay behind and guard the queen .

the best form of defense is attack .
we 're not fighting , are we ?
i-i think i 'm getting this . i 'm actually starting to understand .
every step is planned out in my journal .
are you all right ?
just preposterous .
what obsession ?
you 're obsessed with dolittle .
i 'm loath to admit it ,
kevin 's log , day seven . i 'm now totally isolated .
and now i 'll have it .
exactly what the doctor ordered .
quite a few things , actually . knighthood . windward house .
in no particular order .
oh , it 's breaching .
one last push , madam , if you please .
we did it .
that was a lot , but we did good .
i 've seen armies of every kind ,

what do you mean ?
yeah . i give them a metaphor .

they 're gonna be everywhere .
any idea why , dr. grey ?
it had nowhere to attach since the bone was gone .
it 's missed its chance to attach .
they 've spread into his lymph nodes .
he has a cardiac tumor , which looks like
i-i would be concerned about crohn 's disease
then inject fibrin glue .
what about it ?
it just feels a bit. cavalier , doesn 't it ?
i 'm having a hard time understanding
i 've treated this condition a dozen times .
if you would rather i open her up
it 's more invasive , but fine .

all i ask in return is for a little affection .
i 'll try .
i 'm a patient man , beth .

tommy was big boy , knew what he was gettin ' into .
well , we go way back , you know ? way back .
well , that is not your decision to make .
and you will pay my price .
are you lookin ' to die ?
you like killing unarmed men , don 't you ?
especially when their conversation bores me so .
what 's that :
just .. just kill me .
why , this is the best moment . now , we don 't want to rush this .
you are all alone .
be thankful my son dragged you here behind his horse .

you know , three riders and one woman . mexican .
huh .
they took my wife .
those are awful things for any man to have to say .
but they had the fear of god in their ... eyes .
those things had to be said .

and when they told me ... i learned something about you .
i 'm a married man intent on landing my family .
tackson .

hell , if you don 't pay up
or do you want to make some more ?
ever been to mexico ?
so what do we do with it ?
if we give the tape to them , they 'll finally have

your brother made certain that
i 'm okay now , but in about ten minutes ,
my car is just a few blocks away .
what ?
what do you use in your inhaler ?
just answer the question , please .
how many times i got to prove myself to you ?
the brother you grew up with .
you 're my sister you 're my sister
and it was their idea for you to meet them here
oh , man .
you brought me in too late they 're gone .
let me get this straight .
why would they do that ?
your point ?
wow , you 're good , alex .
no one 's truly innocent .
it must have been the receptionist .
michael scofield . cooper green .
we 're out in the middle of nowhere ,
well , it looks like we 've got nothing but smooth skies ahead ,
when 's the meal coming around ? i 'm starved .
what 's left on the service package ?
no , because this one 's closer to them .
then the fountain .
why ?
isn 't that right ?
over the years here at fun with flags ,
like when you do a two-hour fourth of july spectacular
what 's his problem ?
well , i didn 't think you were supposed to say " sissy " anymore .
what ?
look at me . i should be in a tree baking cookies .
oh , yeah ?
no . no , no , no .
action .
our guest today is a returning fan favorite .
so , was there anything that professor abbott worked on
oh . you were his colleague .
great .
i 'm getting a little tired of everybody 's sarcasm .
no . that 's fine .
i did say that , didn 't i ?
i felt so self-conscious , i had to return them .
you 're doing it again !
i feel like everybody hates me .
they 're just a little intimidated .
if i could ,
i 'd like to take a moment
and if i may get serious for a moment ,
with all its ups and downs ,
before i sign off , i 'd , uh ..
it 's good for times like this .
cut .
that was beautiful .
i pressed it !
that 's the end of roger abbott .
i still keep thinking about how an entire life
some of us may just have to find meaning
i am not a virgin .
all right , come by tomorrow , and we 'll squeeze you in
really :
i 'm thinking about , uh ...
i tend to not dwell on people who stomped on my heart .
ohh .
2 regular parking spaces , 48 handicapped .
we 've been waiting ten minutes for our menu .
hey , it 's a menu , not a high school diploma .
oh , yeah . you were saying something ?
she has so many questions .
okay . uh ... i was just wondering ,
aw . what a short ... angry story .
that 's what first attracted me to him .
i 've got a menu here somewhere .
what ?
oh , adelaide .
she was my best friend growing up .
you 're ... you 're so good to me .
so what do you think ?
i wouldn 't even know where to .. okay , he 's gone .
from my neighbors who betrayed me ...
for whoever tried to kill me .
but i don 't know how to stop .
stop being so hard on yourself .
you just need to focus on what 's good in your life .
well , for starters , me .
i need to go somewhere far away
you can be happy , paul .
and then get rid of it .
hey . karen . gaby 's in the kitchen .
how 's she doing lately ?
yeah ? well , think again .
what are you doing here ?
a steroid freak hits a baseball over a fence ,
second , the doll makes me happy . what do you care ?
you know what ? i don 't want to talk about this anymore .
no ! no ! no !
that was your rule !
hey , susan .
thanks , ethan . hey , how was your history final ?
well , you seemed so upset when you came over .
everything 's fine . it 's not a big deal .
sort of in the middle of packing , so ...
charlie , i 'll be with you in a second , okay ?
keith and i would be great for a while
so why didn 't you tell keith ?
then i changed my mind the moment i saw charlie .
it 's just ... charlie is at that age
okay .
but i 'm glad he 's happy .
i know i owe it to charlie to tell keith .
you would do that ?
now , it 's not exactly finished yet .
don 't worry . i 'm sure it 's amazing .
oh , it was easy .
really :
right down to the last detail .
well , that was a long time ago .
excuse me . i 've gotta find that painter .
i can 't do it . i can 't be a party to this .
lynette , you have to do this .
what are you talking about ?
i mean , today your mother has money .
the day after that , tom and lynette have money .
well , just saying , you 've always wanted to put paige
lynette , in all seriousness , it 's your mother 's wedding day .
lynette !
they 're playing my song .
that is never gonna happen if you 're with him .
marrying a guy for his money .
lynette , i know frank 's a bit of an acquired taste .
he needs me .
your sisters are always busy .
yes , apparently it was the same caliber
what an imagination she has .
mr. young ?
you seemed to have quite a reaction there .
well , just to be clear ,
good day .
forget the blankets . the trip 's off .
i got a call . there 's a problem with the cabin .
and i was so looking forward to it .
i think you dodged a bullet here .
so i , um , stopped by bob and lee 's house .
which got me to thinking ,
uh , yeah .
it 's kind of a weird question .
did you steal it from a shopkeeper or from someone 's closet ?
the 20ds give us everything we need .
you look beautiful
rivers of jewels to adorn you .
and how many children would we have ?
csiris !
i , set ... shall be your one true king .
behold the fate of those who stand in my way .
bow before me or die .
bek !
i think a king should have higher standards .
your journey has just begun .
many of us will stand with you , but now is not the time .
of course you did .
is it true you still never miss ? doesn 't that get dull ?
you fight well . are you so sure you 're his son ?
and so set was king .
one by one , they paid with their lives .
blinded and defeated , horus withdrew into exile .
but i was never much for prayer .
but how could i free her from all this ?
come on , come on ! haven 't got all day .
morning
it is now in this world . you 're either rich or nothing .
only horus can free us .
if horus could come , he would .
his vault will be unlocked tonight .
why ?
he would have his power again .
only a madman would try such a thing
it 's the pit to the center of the world .
found it .
the front gate isn 't the problem .
no , come in . don 't be shy .
no one has ever so honored the great god ra .
is that if ?
well , can you make it any taller ?
yes , it 's a simple question .
tell me , why 'd your father choose you to be master builder
as i shall prove to be the best to my father .
your satisfaction is worth more than old .
you 'll have plenty enough gold for the afterlife .
to egypt 's greatest builder .
where do you even get that many scorpions ?
you dare steal from the king ?
you never did understand that , did you ?
set is your god .
liar !
thank you .
i 'll make it right , zaya .
tributes that rot and stink .
i 'm no worshipper .
yes . a thief .
fo mortal could rob set 's vault .
i 'll show you .
if you bring zaya back .
no one may leave the afterlife once entered .
and only the king can make anubis turn back .
try to keep up .
you are the true sons of egypt .
no father could be more proud .
the rest have retreated to nephthys ' stronghold
so take your fill of gold !
i would only ask something of you .
xou don 't know the di ference .
i have work to do .
crawl back to shadow , you stinking worm !
try as you might .
it is my burden to fight the demon apophis night after night .
so , you see , there are things worse than set
they were both equal in my eyes . as is all of my creation .
so what is it actually that brings you here ?
the waters are not mine .
to kill set . to become king as your father wished .
i heard your prayer the first time .
but after that ?
so become stronger .
when you stray from your path , you grow weak .
he had the gall to strike a bargain with me .
what does it matter : he is but a mortal .
but i 'm uncertain you would be much better .
every last one ?
good . then they 're ripe for the picking .
she 'd want them to fight to the death anyway .
all the more reason to kill her .
our way .
is it right that a goddess should perform such labor ?
you could have been a queen .
then , when i asked you to marry me , why did you say yes ?
i braved those stinging winds just to be at your side .
it didn 't all sting .
perhaps .
i should have been enough to fulfill you .
that 's why ra was wise to ensure you would never have a child .
no one will know , until it 's too late .
what ra gave , he took back .
i got what i needed .
but a few drops from the water of creation can .
with his fire gone , set will be weakened .
you prefer the view from behind ?
you know i can 't lie . turn .
forty
the percentage of knowledge i have so far recorded .
thoth , i only need .
a child could deduce why you 're here .
i ' solve it .
you really watched the world come into being ?
where were you watching it from , if nothing had been created yet ?
i did not choose a path of revenge . i chose none of this .
you have the power to make this right .
i say we cross now .
all the time you were apart , she never forgot you .
yes , but she 's got a big heart .
why do you think set let you live ?
i didn 't want her help .
you know , i think everyone 's a fool .
are you thinking about her ?
i was once known as the mistress of the west .
you traveled to the land of the dead ?
i was young . easily seduced .
demons .
the bracelet of 42 stars .
i knew if there was a way , you would find it .
listen , we can be together again . you can return .
i 'm helping horus .
it is really the bek i love ?
but i was wrong , zaya .
you 're probably thinking , " i told you so , " right now .
yes ?
yes , of course , it 's ... this one .
no , no , it 's this one !
this mortal 's beloved bears no treasure for the scales .
you ask much , mistress .
ho . ho . fo !
for you , mistress of the west ?
you see ? i 'm ready to die
i can understand killing for a crown , but this is madness .
favored son of a favored son .
i thought you 'd be okay with ...
nope .
davids is gonna do leaky pipes ?
you 're still maintaining that .
you 're completely sure there 's only one woman in there ?
rosalinda .
i need you to open that door and come out with your hands up .
ridgeman .
digital eyes are everywhere .
i was that way when we were partners
hey , anthony 's got a mouth with its own engine but he 's solid .
thanks for letting us know about this situation
i watched that video a couple times .
and when we worked together ..
and ?
you get results ,
and fueled by bile .
maybe once you finish high school , you can ..
can you save this adventure ?
all right .
yeah , they are .
yeah . me neither .
you already got our advances .
don 't be an asshole . that 's not what i 'm thinking about .
enough with the justifications .
i saw how you looked at that duffel bag yesterday .
let me think .
financial district in a weekday .
you think they 'd go back to the parking garage after this ?
fifty percent doesn 't value anything .
hope this asshole doesn 't get too curious .
probably not .
they 're loading .
remove the stomach ,
think they 're cops ?
i suspect these men are slim 's associates .
this duo isn 't properly armed for an engagement with us .
i know which one it is .
that is the worst smell in the world , black guys especially .
listen up !
we 're just here for the gold . that 's it .
we 'll let you walk away .
get the gas .
where did you spot me ?
and twice when you was following on the parkway .
stay right there .
that 's what most cops do when they get suspended .
why you taking that off ?
human emotion , my god .
you worried i might get ink poisoning , aren 't you ?
at least my ass is still intact .
before ruan collapsed , he made a
it won 't work .
because it won 't . they need to hold off
max !
you ducked them like a pro .
if you weren 't the shadow home secretary 's campaign manager .
well , i 'm sure you 'll spin it to your own agenda .
where did you get that ?
i take your point .
thom , he 's too close to it .
you won 't have a problem then , will you ?
no , just start with the " a " class , son .
jesus , jake .
otis did the deals .
four days ago , otis was found
they know who he is , jake .
because of us .
wha ?
.. hurt people .
do well at school , juka ?
yes .
and i guarantee you 'll get remembered as a nobody .
what are you thinking ?
and let 's see what comes crawling in .

when you 've done that ..
don 't get involved in this mess .
i take it we 're not staying here .

of all people , i thought you 'd have believed in that .
thom ?
i can 't understand why an officer from clubs and vice
i told you the hospital was yours and nothing else .
well , so did harvey crown .

why did one of them run ?

i 've got the press jumping all over me ,

it was gonna change things , make things better for us .
just .. one more gun scandal
she found warns
i just don 't understand why you invited him here today .
when i called him , he had nothing to do ,
oh , sorry . we 'll keep it down .
i 'm about to use the blender ,
well , sheldon started talking about how his dad isn 't alive anymore ,
stir the gravy .
i 'll be back in like five , ten minutes .
it 's all right . i didn 't have anything going on .
yeah , okay , great .

i don 't know if i want to sign it .
i just think splitting up can be rough on kids .

we could never afford a real elvis .
good call .
hang on . you know what ?
soap from animal fat , just there .
very good .
my , my . aren 't you handsome .
even with the heat of your blushing ,
i don 't have my nose plug !
manny , say something !
oh , honey , i can help you find it . it 's okay .
the water 's really clear .
you don 't think it draws too much attention to me ?
i do , too . i do , too .
that makes us complete star you-know-what-ers .
everybody have their sunscreen and bug spray ?
oh , my god . it 's so big .
oh , you 're talking about the boat .
oh , guys . thank god you 're here .
oh , no . what happened ?
oh , well , he has to know
that 's my boy !
hey . an ice bucket .
so i took some things , too .
i like stealing .
and what 's in the ice bucket ?
who 's here so early ?
you left juarez so fast , i didn 't get to say goodbye .
it 's just a coping mechanism . it 's gonna pass .
his name was whiskers .
so , cam totally took his family 's side
you always take your family 's side .
remember when you first brought cam home
i guess i did do that , huh ?
aww . says the murderer .
tell her to bring manny and the cookies to a neutral place ,
she has your son .
don 't worry . he 's going to be fine .
my parents will be worried sick .
well , maybe she has a reason to think
this is why you sabotage my whole life ?
don 't love that .
i can 't believe it .
it must have been hard for a little girl .
okay .
no , no . your jealousy is all i need .
not manny .
oh ! lily , we were gonna open grams ' gifts together !
i was raised to hate your kind .
yes . you were .
no , no , wait . there 's more . there 's more .
are you even using soap ?
yeah , i really do .
well , what are you talking about ?
well , yeah , but it 's not the most important thing .
all the smart things i say , and you remember the dumb one .
i don 't know if that 's a good idea .
i respect that .
oh , thank you .
i know . just , ugh !
oh , no , i 'm sure , definitely sure . don 't call her .
the last time we were in this room , we were getting married .
it 's a lot less impressive without mark hamill in it .
a few weeks ago , someone told us about your paper ,
free headphones .
so you weren 't even thinking about super-asymmetry ?
yeah , who remembers the guy
but this is different .
everyone knows you were there first .
no , that 's just a scary campfire story
you come up with your own idea .
wouldn 't that be something , though ?
look , dr. cooper ,
nothing else would hold her .
since last evening .
if it is really you , then show yourself .
these woods are filled with them
you kill creatures of the dark .
it fills me with confidence .
to be no good at something bad is good .
i looked it up in an old spell book about the blue spark
so it. didn 't mean anything ?
when he was very young
i want to stay here forever .
what would we do ?
i had my chance to kill her ,
locked her away in a cage buried in the ground .
but i was wrong .
i want you to meet my wife , mr. ward .
my daughter has spotted them . they 're moving closer .
alive .
tusk !
what the hell is that ?
the stone !
no , no , no , no .
i was just killing this enormous , scary monster thing
my mother gave it to me .
zou , mr. ward .
the witches ' most sacred talisman . it strengthens their powers .
tn her hands it has tremendous power .
only then was i able to defeat her , to trap her .
so that is what you are ...
oh , that 's funny .
come on .
no , thank you .
nope . no , nope !
come on , let 's go . i 'll race you ! come on !
the hell , baby ?
nothing
you don 't excite me . you don 't make me happy .
why won 't you accept it ?
well , where are you going ?
i just wanna go home .
i 'm sorry that they did that to you .
what ?
tikki , what 's wrong ? where 's charlie ?
he 's in there .
what happened ? chris .
we are all going to die .
another large aircraft is heading for uik airspace
in a surprising and alarming move , tanks are on the streets of london .
something top secret . something classified .
are we gonna listen to a guy who lives in a storage unit and is clearly crazy ?
hello , perhaps you 're the one who 's deranged . did you not see the fucker ?
okay , let 's imagine for one second
to survive , perhaps ? i don 't know . fuck knows , i haven 't got a clue .
maybe it 's trying to find another way in
even if we got out of here , we 'd still be trapped . where would you go ?
we find him , we find the device , we can get out .
if the engineer wanted to override the system , he 'd go down there .
hm ? shit , he 's right . what we need are weapons .
hm ? no .
other units .
not out . up .
that 's where all the larger units are . that 's where all the good stuff is .
she has ambition , you ...
charlie , i really think that we have enough .
shh !
no good .
this thing has to hold up
maybe if you were helping , you 'd feel better about yourself .
of course you feel terrible .
you don 't really believe in that superstition , do you ?
i 'm going to make a coffee run. do you want any ?
great. so how 'd it go with stuart last night ?
yeah. right. sure .
oh , please , don 't do that .
you know ? they have to help the viewers let go .
buffy the vampire slayer continued on as a comic book .
i feel bad for whoever gets that phone call .
" if they didn 't want to be yelled at by crazy nerds ,
well , you just put me through to the people who handle that ,
no , i am not the person who just called .
yeah , who was plumb concerned
i 'm sorry you 're upset .
i am not flying back to texas
well , what i think is going on here
i mean , you tell me stories about your day all the time .
you know , i might be able to help you with this .
listen to me ,
rig the game .
is it fair that girls like confident , normal guys
i 've always thought that was unfair .
why do you have to make everything so filthy ?
" the key to her heart . "
come in .
yeah , well , i wouldn 't get too close .
o 'er the land of the free
yes .
sheldon , sheldon , give it !
oops , missed one .
oh . i kind of just write that for myself .
no kidding . you didn 't make it easy to find .
for the record , you have excellent credit scores .
you called me feminine .
i wanted you to think i was more manly .
i meant that you 're sweet and thoughtful
i can 't believe that wasn 't on my list !
i told you to run .
and i could have lived to 102 .
just enjoy the moment .
i miss you .
yes , i do .
oh , my god , skye . stop .
are you really gonna punch someone in the face ?
are you sure we 're allowed to be
you can change in .... there .
then why are we whispering ?
you make all the rules .
you jumped off of that ?
it 's not called " state jumping championship . "
you think we made the right choice ,
all her friends are here .
spends all her time with calvin .
do you think we can trust him ?
ooh , these are cute .
it doesn 't matter . i 'm going to tell her we can 't make it .
i don 't understand .
and we 're going to use that to our advantage .
by accepting the invitation , bernadette becomes
i don 't-know . i 'm not a very good liar .
i don 't understand . is this a way to break in new shoes ?
pretty , pretty , pretty .
the what ?
message received .
i don 't .. oh .

wow . that 's very impressive .
thank you .
i 'm going to be 30 years old ,
the fun thing about prince joey
yellow . go ahead .
he says it 's the next big thing
i 'm not sure .
i like cows .
it was its own point . go on .
my ability to think is my bread and butter .
damn it , the shoes are right .
what do you got for me , wildebeest ?
the story 's starting to fall apart .
we may have to kill her .
where are you now ?
oh , look at this ,
they 're just asking me
what astronaut story ?
i texted " architect . " that 's amusing .
yeah , it 's hysterical .
architect . where would you have met an astronaut ?
i don 't want to do this anymore !
bernie , you okay ?
thank you for coming with me , sheldon .
i 'm glad you think so .
okay , let 's see if this drug works .
forgive me for staring , but you 're very beautiful .
that 's a great accent . where are you from ?
oh , cool . i 've always wanted to go there .
may i join you ?
my name is dr. rajesh koothrappali ,
i 'm just here to observe .
we 're scientists . we observe everything .
fortunately , when you say no to everything ,
there 's nothing underneath the bed ,
yes , monsters need places to hide .
what ?
nothing .
maybe that 's how he got in .
if he came across the roof
i snuck in through joe 's
i can 't afford to get grounded .
why are you flipping out ?
oh , so now you think i 'm crazy ?
well , maybe i am crazy , but i have a damn good reason .
i 'm wearing real loose clothes . i need money real bad .
uh , you 're in love ?
okay . oh , god .
and if they find out , then they 'll just know
i mean , how many months along are you ?
i assume it 's this one . oh , what are you doing ?
what ? !
oh , no , i think my water just broke .
i 'm fixing to reproduce right now !
no , mitchell , that 's for livestock .
yeah , i-i know . i know .
well , why do you think ?
you know you 're the person i look up to mo-o-o-o-o-st .
do you really need to record this ?
okay , little one , here we are back at home
and here 's your daddy .
all right , enough with the camera .
some day she 's gonna want to see this .
who 's gonna want to see this ?
good . then you 're used to this .
come on ! everyone to the hospital !
just try to relax . we 'll be there any minute .
speed it up a little .
i just can 't see at night .
hey . squinty , the gas pedal 's on the right !
if you see any pedestrians , just call ' em out .
how cool is that ?
alex
he was in his uniform
hand me my phone . i need my phone .
why do we think that 's george ?
i don 't know .
look , at his feet , at how tall he is ,
what did he do ?
he wrote with his finger ?
okay , what did i write ?
n-no ! no , i did not write " joe . "
can we get him on the phone ?
just sh
you don 't get to talk ever again .
i got voice mail .
it 's shaped like texas . i used to tease him about it .
you people , answer your pagers .
he knew what he was doing , and he did it anyway ,
there are lives on the line .
so if george o 'malley can jump in front of a bus ,
damn it .
oh , stanley , how nice of you to drop by .
olivia ? no , no .
and she 's a bit taller than me , and she 's in london ,
oh , you must be the american
can i give you something ?
we 've just eaten .
good heavens , are you seriously going to have more food ?
now , tell me something about my aunt vanessa 's colorful past .
she 's not a performing monkey .
i 'm sorry , it 's 3 : 00 , and i was supposed to meet brice for drinks ,
i 've always questioned your common sense .
and i 've always tried to teach you that we don 't know .
we 're just poor , limited human beings .
olivia likes me as i am . sophie agrees we 're a match made in heaven .
no , but there , she 's guessing correctly .
tell me something about my aunt .
oh , my pearls .
where have you been all my life ?
oh , uh , very young . my ... my teens .
well , my father abandoned us , and we were very poor .
more what
it always used to be open .
goodness me .
what is this ? it 's an observatory .
oh , thank god we found it .
are you kidding ? we could 've been struck by lightning
nothing .
i 've already told you i want to marry you .
it 's enormous , and it can accommodate
what do you think ?
and then we 'll live in europe .
i 'll be so proud of you .
i told you i was gonna pamper you .
then , i won 't .
it has such sentimental meaning
were you always faithful to me ?
certain so-called friends of mine suggested otherwise ,
oh , harry ..
1 ... i was the only one , wasn 't i ?
why aren 't you in your room , practicing ?
what are you and brice up to ?
mother and i are going swimming .
nonsense . i accept your invitation .
the rocks ? even better .
or maybe two or three times ,
they never .. they never stopped
ah , but notice i say , " appears to be . "
how are you ?
listen , alvin , i have the story of a lifetime for your paper
it 's a theatrical piece , but it 's ...
it 's science , it 's .
brice is coming home tonight from paris .
have you decided to accept brice 's marriage proposal ?
well , i 'd grab it if i were you .
an uneducated nobody
there have actually been a number of ,
although , with the ability you have ,
well , i wouldn 't say charming , but it is impressive .
they 're more than agreeable .
can i ask what time of day that might be ?
dusk . you 're prettiest at about 8 : 20 in the summer , when the light is fading
you coming to the ball , at the palace ?
my whole life i 've wanted to go to a ball like that .
i do , indeed .
my aunt vanessa .
i am going to dance and drink
didn 't you say that we might have a dance together ?
she so appreciates your support .
you know that you 're the only person tonight
i never dreamed you could look this beautiful .
you must have moved mountains to achieve this effect .
you know , tomorrow i 'm doing that press conference about you .
apart from my gift ,
in the time that we 've spent together ,
i don 't mean as a mystic .
as a woman ?
i 've never technically regarded you as a woman .
so you never thought about me as a female ?
and quite good to look at .
i 've exposed some pretty unattractive mediums ,
well , i think you 'd be insane not to .
and common sense would say that this man
as a phenomenon , you 'll always be able to do quite well ,
your foundation , where he 'll be a great help .
you don 't tell me you 're experiencing romantic feelings for me ?
well , that 's absurd .
isn 't it enough you 've opened my eyes to the joy of living ?
do you , do you also need to conquer my heart ?
don 't misunderstand me . i .
i hold you in the highest possible esteem ,
i don 't know about you , but i danced till dawn .
well , why shouldn 't she ? according to the newspapers ,
i believe she fancies herself falling in love with me .
know . it defies all reason
i was rather taken aback
she did make a rather
how did you first discover miss baker ?
how can you be so certain she 's authentic ?
debunking fake mediums , my specialty .
she plans to start a foundation
well , on the one side , i 'm embarrassed ,
i deserve your criticism , i know .
what can i say ?
even as a baby , it was clear
yes , there 'll be students from all over the world .
they are very close friends of mine .
now you see the result .
there you are . excuse me .
what ?
what happened ? is she all right ?
do you want me to come with you ? i know the way ..
bonjour , george .
yes , how do you do ?
en anglais .
everyone is doing his best .
is she going to be all right ?
touch-and-go ?
and that includes miss sophie baker .
well , if sophie is a fraud ,
oh , we were all so worried . so worried !
yes !
well , couldn 't sophie have predicted the outcome
i was so mobbed by all the press , i .
well , it 's all over .
well , now that everything 's ended well ,
now , you 've got to understand that since we were boys ,
have fooled the man who could not be fooled
i said i 'd teach it to you if you behaved yourself ,
to one was harmed .
your reputation is all ego !
yes , yes , things got out of hand ,
you saw the world as optimists see the world .
what would you have been doing ?
all my optimism was an illusion .
i didn 't really understand much of it ,
i 'm going to go and visit my aunt vanessa
well , i can 't forgive you .

you know what i had to do when i was your age ?
you show me one thing in here we can live without .
check your in-box .
we 've lived together for years
well , that means " not one , " or " not any "
check it out .
yeah , i can control all sorts of stuff .
not when i said " mute " and pointed it at her face .
channelis changeroni !
well , that 's the last time i play with that .
hello ?
and on .
i think you have me confused with
there 's plenty of room for everybody ,
sometimes i can see space battles through it .
do you think this is cool ?
you 're right , it 's great .
you guys didn 't break up .
it 's just , you were scared and miserable the whole time .
l-like how women often forget the pain of childbirth .
fine , maybe i was a little scared .
you 're supposed to do that .
son , do i need to remind you what you asked me to do
you wanted me to shoot you in the foot .
" you got to get me out of this . shoot me in the foot . "
and you threw up again .
that was funny .

lynette , you really hit this one out of the park .
terrence did a lot of the heavy lifting on this one .
strangely , i 'm not embarrassed .
you listen to me , carlos solis !

but i have a feeling a big , fat check
that should get her to the top of the waiting
you know the problems that i 'm facing
hello ... gentlemen .

it is worth the hassle .
she loves it there .
yeah . would you excuse me for a second ?

not everybody in your profession gets it right .
look ..
i 'll give you that . it 's a fine piece of writing .
blood diner ..
your bad theory helped a killer go free . you ruined people 's lives .
we sure don 't want that circus that you bring with you .
if that girl is still alive , then it ain 't no miracle
you don 't think the town deserves an explanation ?
and if you were able to , the odds are you wouldn 't much care for the answer .
and this is just another waste of your time like your last two books .
that 's clever . you ought to write that down .
well , what do you know ? you can still get things right on occasion .
what was all that about ? the usual .
and i don 't wanna hear another thing about why we 're here , from anybody .
you didn 't brush your teeth .
you 're not coming to bed ?
how long is it gonna be ?
no , i mean ... how long are we here for this time ?
i liked it better when you were writing fiction .
trevor , where 's your notebook ?
can you see it in there ?
that 's it . ok
trevor , what on earth were you thinking ?
that 's your problem . you don 't think .
you and dad do lots of thinking . if you did , we wouldn 't be here .
i know more than you .
i don 't wanna see you until dinner .
what happened ?
but i 'm not some local moron .
i have a degree in criminology .
i also know a series of connected murders when i see one , mr. oswalt .
we missed something . i get that .
you really wanna help ?
what happened here happened to all of us .
who is that ?
you think these are serial murders ?
that would put the guy , what , in his 70s ?
yeah , i .
well , look at the methodology .
with what ?
but by drugging them , the killer removes his need to overpower them .
in sacramento he lit a family on fire . in st. louis he slit their throats .
you have done some crazy shit in the past ,
we 've never been this broke before . that 's no excuse .
gee , i wonder why .
yes .
i got the feeling they were sort of enjoying themselves .
what would you say to bringing your boys over to my house
i 'm sorry .
play dates she was determined to keep ..
at all costs .
okay .
those we lost along the way ...
a uterus staring me in the face ?
the susan mayer i know would be a ...
she 's fun to watch .
no . i came between the man and his son
over the past couple of days ,
i just think if i start acting like an adult for once
you 're numb .
actually , l did want to just see if you were aware that you
just please don 't give it back to me . it 's tacky .
anything else ?
i mean , i understand
you 're not writing about me , are you ?
are you gonna be fair ?
i was afraid of that .
george had a ring .
well , l know it sounds rash , but ...
we share the same tastes and interests .
the opera ?
so you 're on the rebound from the plumber .
karl , it would be so weird .
there 's nothing weird about us
thanks so much for taking care of the boys .
leonard and i are gonna take them all to the water park .
and we 're gonna be able to take penny soon , aren 't we ?
one of your ... private videos
oh , no , don 't worry.i caught it , i caught it ..
i have to go .
we just thought you needed to know what happened .
you know , what we 're saying is , we get it .
i 'm just so relieved this all worked out .
oh , no !
she 's a knockout , george .
since i was single all these years ,
but i guess i 'll be getting that
that 's just stan 's little joke
i want bree all to myself for a while .
how can you say that ?
really ? well , i didn 't know .
that 's the kind of thing that people who are engaged
it 's not just that , george .
look ..
we should slow things down .
yes . just because two people are engaged
how 'd you do ?
people are gonna start coming home from work soon .
he doesn 't know the area , so he 's got to be close by .
bree , i desperately need your help .
anything ?
pretty much .
uh , the big news ?
and i know that he stayed at your place last night ,
edie , uh .
he showed up with flowers and he apologized for everything
you 've gotta make it tighter .
i don 't care .
gosh , do you actually think they 're gonna make fun of you ?
but why ? i mean , surely they have friends who have children .
i 'm not gonna give them the satisfaction
edie britt !
i 'm just not in a very festive mood right now .
did they tell you about the change ? i 'm gonna go last .
i 'm sorry . it wasn 't my decision .
what is wrong with you ?
for god 's sake , helen , this is for charity !
a monster for the children to play with , perhaps ?
a palace ?
i really double you 've made that mistake .
it will not stand .
i hope it will stand for 100 years as a symbol of my husband 's gallant victory .
horatio has done it again .
you do not need a peace treaty proposal
one battle will not win the war .
we 're out of money . my point .
we must destroy them .
how sweet your wife is , marlborough .
i cannot agree .
my father always spoke highly of you !
he had charm to burn .
you have fallen far .
you are not serious .
oh , he was very upset about it .
colonel masham .
the queen will ride on wednesday .
would you like a bite of my new maid before you leave ?
fastest duck in the city .

the land tax is to be doubled .
the war you will be fighting will be in our own countryside .
there are limits .
to me , there is no limit on that .
and our last man , too ?
or that does not concern you ?
and i send my own beloved with them , chest bared .
yes .
i am prepared to pay it .
just relax and aim .
throw .
i will make a killer of you yet .
i said are you following me ?
as i am in front of you .
i am a servant .
perhaps you dreamt of me ?
and i should have you stripped and whipped .
about time mrs freeman ,
you cut it off from me , will you ?
why are you here ?
so , what 's been happening ?
do you want to get punched ?

doubling of the tax would have been a disaster .

abigail ?
it seems colonel masham has fallen for her , he wishes to marry .
costing a fortune built on your paranoia and walking into god knows what .
i will think on it for a while .
we need to act now .
if the party 's going well , they did not need you , and they resent the intrusion .
it is not like a party .

just like recovering alcoholics drink in the caribbean .
oh . hi , amy .

yeah , it 's a great time to be alive , isn 't it ?
look , sheldon , leonard is dating priya .

if it were the birthplace of motion pictures ,
so needy .
i 'm setting out snacks .
i didn 't say the snacks were for you now , did i , nosy rosie ?
yes . must be killing you wondering who .

who 's ready to play some vintage video games ?
well , yeah , i guess .
more or less .
i don 't know .
and then after , it 's mostly embarrassment ,
yeah , well , it 's not gonna happen tonight .
for example , do you have an electric toothbrush ?
you should get one .
it appears to be something preserved
leonard gave it to me last year .
yeah , it was .
i don 't know what it is about that guy .
well , you scared the bad man away .
they 're still asleep .
that 's a weird brag , howard .
bernadette thinks i have poor parenting skills .

i didn 't think you were coming .
i thought it 'd be fun to spend some time with your children .
uh , it 's like word for word .
35 seconds .
sheldon , he 's a baby .
he grabbed my finger .
that 's time .
can we do one more ?
by pushing a lever at the end
although , sheldon , maybe it could be an experiment .
sure .
i never thought i would see sheldon enjoying himself
so he just happened to stumble upon a book
to get the card ?
anything else ?
eight guards will accompany scylla from the basement bunker
that is why i have a full secret service escort
we need air support all the way to river rock .
it may be hard for you to believe ,
when the plane lands , the same precautions will be taken .
and that 's for the brace ?
attaching that is going to be the most uncomfortable pant .
do we have to listen to this ?
and then what ?
the doctor will use
then it 's the gamma knife unit .
i 've got two more boxes in the car
you okay ?
the floor sensors can detect
we have to traverse the distance between the two walls
we make one wrong move ,
all this security and only one man

sucre , you were drilling there , right ?
all right , in order to get
like old times .
oh .. you 're tense .
let me get in there .
my card .
what are you talking about ? your card .
i never thought that , at the age of 63 ,
don 't you know that if you 'd waited just a little bit longer ,
you 're sure she 's a fed ?
she 's got a gun under there .
well , that 's a nice way to put it .
what are we calling that now , a setback ?
you have any idea what i 'm giving up here ?
you 're crying over $ 50,000 ? are you serious ?
i make money . i get mail .
12-hour days and eating leftover lo-mein .
yeah , maybe ,
it will suppress the rapid firing of neurons
i mean it .
and as soon as this is over , i 'm taking you to the hospital .
this is gonna go exactly as planned .
i 'm not praying for me .
you wanted to see me ?
don 't you have your eagles and angels luncheon ?
you called me in here to confirm my lunch plans ?

i just thank the good lord your father didn 't live to see this .
we 're having a wedding cake , right ?
yeah , but you have to give people a choice .
i don 't know ... you , a big white dress , melted chocolate .
fine , we 'll skip the chocolate .
how about the dove wrangler ?
do we really need 40 of ' em ?

no known history . unconscious on arrival .
we have found your computer at your mother 's apartment .
my manifesto .
it 's all there , 1,500 pages .
yeah , this is a war . attacks can come at any moment .
but what concerns us mostly is that
and it was a bit complex .
what does this mean ?
but his condition is critical .
i had a very happy upbringing . i grew up in west oslo .
sit down .
my half-sister and i are not very close , but we speak occasionally .
we spoke a couple of years ago , but there was really no time to meet .
how would you describe your relationship with your mother ?
it 's all about understanding what .. led you to do this .
and you love them ?
i wanted to hit them where it would hurt the most .
our focus has been on islamist terror .
but they do not go through this alone .
here then , we 'll hear shortly about the prime minister 's ...
you fucking nazi lover . i know where you live .
the prime minister today announced an official inquiry into the attacks of the 22nd of july .
let me help you .
our work will begin immediately . thank you .
whatever went wrong , we must confront it .
who was that on the phone ?
it 's the third one tonight .
i 'm lara .
it is clear that this is going to be a long recovery .
of course there 's brain damage
we are going to have to take it one day at a time .
is there anything you are wondering about ? your rehabilitation or .
a leader . and a leader doesn 't give away his power .
but this is my trial . i decide how it ends .
you 'll go to prison for the rest of your life .
that 's the third attack .
that 's how i win .
he wants to plead guilty .
he wants to stay in control .
he wants to stand up
the prosecution are legally obliged to stick with it .
ok , so we have to start again .
you 're still very weak .
thank you for coming today , prime minister .
that was obviously a question that concerned me greatly .
prime minister , our investigation suggests something different .
but this was not acted on .
can we turn to the issues of physical security around government quarters ?
it appears from the papers
the knights templar are a network of patriots
hey , how 's the new book coming along ?
and then , bam , i start thinking that it 's the stupidest thing ever .
also . i 'm feeling ambivalent about scottv .
he pees like a girl , which makes me feel inadequate .
no . why do think you 're not writing ?
do you need bobby now ? yes .
... when 's the last time you saw a friend ?
what did you say your hopes were ? do you remember ?
a little louder , please ?
but scotty gets scared when people try to pet him .
no . i wanna give you a writing assignment .
this would just be for me .
and he 'd already been at the top ...
and i remember thinking :
... gave us what may very well become a classic american novel .
but it was only when i sat down and reread his novel ...
that , uh , i realized just how good a writer calvin weir-fields is .
ladies and gentlemen , calvin weir-fields .
brilliant . thanks so much .
sometimes , she 's mean as fuck for no reason .
you haven 't written a person , okay ?
writers don 't show their work to people at this stage .
because ... and don 't , like , tell people about it .
i 'm saving ..
yes .
what ?
what do you mean i 'm not your type ?
why would you date a guy like that ?
not really .
so that 's what you 're looking for in a guy ?
it just took me a while to find you .
what did you think the first time you saw me ?
were you disappointed when you got to know me ?
i 'm such a mess .
i can see her , i can smell her .
she 's making eggs in my kitchen . actual eggs .
calvin , i am at work . i 'm in the middle of a very important meeting .
... i started writing something , so that 's been really consuming .
am i ... ?
um , am i in it ?
but if i am , like , when it comes out in stores and stuff
of course . do you , um ... ?
hi . sorry , what ?
hi . sorry .
am i interrupting ? i thought i heard something .
calvin .
there is a lot that is new here , more than i can tell you .
then talk to me about it .
i wasn 't on a date .
oh , i 'm just having trouble ..
that you 're here .
holy shit .
she 's real .
.. but she 's here and she 's real .
" real " as in other people can see her . that 's what i 'm trying to tell you .
what does dr. rosenthal say ?
people have shrinks for when they start seeing things .
calvin , call him . i can 't .
that 's what happened to me . heh-heh-heh .
has it occurred to you that she might be an imposter ?
you 're the only one who 's read my manuscript .
write something about her , see if it comes true .
and if nothing happens ..
don 't call .. ust go in there and act normal . go up .
we 're gonna go upstairs and check on something , uh , online .
okay , here 's where i left off .
something obvious .
what she 's wearing .
was it pink ?
okay . okay .
yeah , just put it down .
it 's a family recipe .
so your ... your family 's in ohio ?
... and i cot moved around a lot .
you manifested a woman with your mind .
why not ? she loves all this new age shit . seriously ...
this is amazing . how can i not tell ? they 'll think she 's a freak .
i mean , you could get blowjobs whenever you wanted .
now , but what about in a couple months or days ?
so you can make her , like , do anything .
what do you want , mom ?
i told you we can 't this weekend . we 're busy .
busy with what ?
he doesn 't know . you 've been with this girl for months .
oh , my god , i can 't believe you said that .
mort got this wood from amish land . it was blessed .
that 's incredible .
that 's where harry will sleep .
it means a lot to me .
dinner 's in a half hour .
you wanna see my impression of scotty ? yeah .
wanna see my impression of scotty when he 's really angry ?
that 's so wrong .
oh , my god . you look so cute here .
you should try it . it 's really mellow .
his brain is big enough . yeah , no , it 's big
just ..
just ..
one thought . i mean , he just can just , poof .
what are you talking about ? i 'm talking about i love you .

great to talk to you . okay .

typical that you 'd say something like that about me .
what have you given up for me ?
you really are a heartless monster .
and i do not want your fucked up frigid ideas about anything .
there 's nothing wrong with success .
mum , i have fucked everything that moves .
all of them .
some girl was more important to you than me .
you left me at the most important time , bernie .
if you don 't care about yourself ,
it 's not weak
day in , day out .
and now , it 's me that can 't walk down the streets .
you should come along .
well , that 's all right . i don 't really do illegal .

we 're making sure we keep on top of every situation .
i don 't get what she 's talking about .
what does that mean ?
what do you mean , infiltrate ? do you mean go inside ?
it 's probably against the law , for a start .
let 's make a spectacle of our own .
of course . we 'd just have an action inside as well .

unless that 's too organised .
communal clothes .
no . you look like a bag lady .
this is your skirt .
you couldn 't even get a bank account without dad 's permission .

virgil .
excuse me , sir . would you consent to a voluntary search ?
bad luck , chief .
ground rules , same as last time .
don 't bark at me . i 'm not your dog .
how many more times must i do your job
two weeks ago , this painting " model , rear-view "
before yesterday .
clowns try to be funny . you 're just unintentionally hysterical .
feel it on back and you 're left with the original oil painting underneath .
it 's a marvelous picture . i 'm delighted to have it as part of my collection .
where 's the seurat ? !
crunch , she 's , she 's not even trying anymore .
oh , i don 't know , francie .
hell , i thought i 'd be a great man .
understood the word " francie'
oh , different mothers .
their father was the johnny appleseed of sperm .
you 're gettin ' old , crunch .
look , if it 's an apology you need to put this thing to bed ..
exactly . i owe you one .
let 's do that , then . let 's go back to work .
you boys done fistin ' in to one another ?
so , can we get down to work now ?
but the driver got greedy and tried to smuggle a brick of hash
but any expert 's gonna look at that gospel
we get the bible , we take it to detroit .
leave him , lad . i got him .
sir , i 'm telling you , it 's happening
and crunch , we know he 's desperate for money .
so i need you to authorize eyes on every entry point
look , there 's no fuckin ' way you 're getting a firearm .
come on ! hold up !
yeah , well , jail will do that to a man .
bottom line is , i know that you 're hard up for cash .
so we do this thing with paddy
oh . hi , little girl . what 's your name ?
oh yeah ? very cute .
gee , i don 't know .
there 's supposed to be a code , nicky !
you never put the paycheck over your honor .
there is no angle .
you 're always hedging , you 're always working it .
well , i got news for you .
gotta be a cheaper way to do this .
like just ' cause you like being drunk doesn 't make you an alcoholic .
crunch ! we need the money . how are we gonna pay our bills ?
oh . so , so you made her do this ?
fe needs me
well , he needs someone to stop him from taking dives for $ 800 .
all right . i 'll do it . but this one we do my way .
well , let 's just say things are gonna get a little loud .
and nicky 's already dealt with the main gate
this may be the worst idea in the history of the world .
there 's no dude who can feed a video loop to make some security guard
i actually thought that was kind of bad-ass .
he 's my apprentice
look , the reverend 's got somebody on the inside .
what time is it in france ?
yeah , guy , it 's nicky .
the son-of-a-bitch hung up on me .
hm . america light .
i don 't give a shit ! motherfuck !
i want to see the piece of paper that says you can go through that !
and you know it and you know it !
ten thirty-two ? you trying to impress me with numbers ?
i got a number for you : one ,
when i was ten or 11 ,
it was a drinking cup fashioned from a single piece of jade .
and it made me look at everything differently .
it was a feeling i had , a completeness when art touched me .
and you .... what makes you do it ?
it 's always nice to know ...
i 'm gonna find this painting .
i just want to hold it .
you ever seen the inside of sing-sing ?
are you hitting on me ?
it 's been a breath of fresh air .
interpol ? fucking interpol ? !
you see these fuckin ' arms , man ?
francie , i promise you on my mother 's eyes ,
now ... i might have to toss in the " f " word here
that has to be guy .
interpol .
the toad is in the hole .
the fuckin ' huge vagina is in the border station now .
but , since no crime has been committed , they can 't touch us .
it 's four foot high and staring you in the face .
they 're going to be watching us , which we need to fix .
just trust me for a second . don 't switch the engine on .
you 're being distracted
they stopped following us .
two minutes away . come on !
hey ! hey ! here we go . here we go .
all right , just like the old days .
or the old days where a one-eyed pirate steals my bike ?
ok , but don 't the amish ride horse and carriages ?
i can 't fucking do this !
yeah , look , francie , it 's not the king 's speech .
i 'll meet him there .
yeah . hey , look , somebody 's got to be in detroit
do you often feel that your life is just passing you by ?
ok . ok , francie .
i think we can make a lot more money off that gospel
great . parallel . hot interested
uncle paddy can come up with at least ten more buyers .
we contact the gallery , we let them know their book is stolen .
meanwhile we ship off ten copies to ten buyers .
goddamn it if it 's not perfect .
uhh ! i just need to tell you something
it 's not bad . its ok . danny glover .
break a leg .
come on !
you motherfucker ! no , no ! hold on !
fuck you ! hold on ! hey !
i think he paid like three grand for the whole place .
this is a golden opportunity . i 'm not doing this for me .
we 're dropping this off , we 're making a hell of a decent score here .
ok . where do we find the money to pay for these fakes ?
these fakes would have to stand up to carbon dating
you got a 100 grand laying around , nicky ?
you know , i guess this is it .
we could have made history .
all right , let 's go downstairs and talk about it .
ten buyers , i can find . maybe more .
guy , when can you get started ?
it will take me maybe three weeks ... no , one month .
ok , 100 grand , that 's covered .
seven hundred , fifty thousand , minimum .
no . i made the cover for ten grand . the pages are total shit .
do we need to carbon date them ?
that 's it , man . let 's go take it back .
i could come up with about $ 300,000 .
if there was ever a reason to mortgage your home ..
no , not the house . that 's all i got .
look , man , i just .... . look , i don 't know , ok ?
well , don 't take too long . we don 't have time to lose .
i know what you want .
ah , jesus murphy .
what can i say ? i 'm excited .
so , starting tomorrow , there 'll be no contact .
and lola will be handling the money .
ha . the reverend 's gonna be some pissed .
here 's a key to the building .
guy 's books will be perfect .
however , your copies , they won 't need any of that carbon dating crap .
why bother getting all that proper paper for guy 's books ?
because i plan on sending your ten copies of the book
i see . family 's family , but money 's money , eh ?
crunch would do the same damn thing if he had any brains in his head .
but then they 're gonna come after you , my fine chum .
later , crunch ! there 's gotta be like ...
ten experts in the country
it 's nicky calhoun .
what ?
he left a couple of days ago .
gospel ? the fuckin ' gospel according to james !
whac ?
you just took five and half of the best years of my life away , nicky .

and then picked it on up .
saturday , ten am . guy walks into the border station .
i don 't need a warrant .
domenic calhoun , we 've received information
georges seurat .
i need you to find something for me .
ten buyers i can find , maybe more .

i can pull together a hundred thousand .

yeah , i just told you . i was at cvs breathing my ass off .
you were breathing the rarefied air of celebrities .
then why are you trembling ?
we saw you on instagram .

i didn 't mean to say that .
i can 't tell you !

thing are out of control and they 're going to kill him .
we have to get to them first . are you going to help me ?
ethan is my friend
what do i have to go on ?
and not a lot of time .
where does he come from ?
well . if british intelligence knows the syndicate exist ,
so , to get the ledger , one of us needs to enter the torus
that 's the only way . that 's the only way .
seawater flows through the intake .
if any metal enters the intake .
swim from the intake to the service hatch
well . that 's gonna be like a minute tops .
but i think you 're overlooking , is the physical exertion .
don 't worry about him . alright .
you said it yourself , it 's the only way .
satellite over-watch covering all 7 continents ,
of course i made a copy .
it 's a ledger .
who they are , the politicians they control , and where the money comes from .
what makes you think this so-called ledger is authentic ?
why would he ever let you have it if it was ?
and he didn 't bring you in ?
you knew perfectly well it was blank .
was it in your possession the entire time ?
but you knew i was going to take it to him .
i hope it would be enough to get you out .
and for the sake of your friend , you will do it .
your mission , should you choose to accept it ,
i accept .
that hunt has targeted the prime minister ?
you picked up some terrible habits from your friend , brandt
chief attlee . chief attlee
chief attlee , i have reason to believe that the prime minister 's life is in danger .
going once . going twice .
sir . chief attlee from mi6 needs to see you .
what 's this all about ?
under no circumstances is anyone to enter .
help me to understand .
i 'm afraid , prime minister , director hunley and i share responsibility for this .
and he 's gone rogue , unfortunately intend on
ilsa faust , prime minister . she disappeared 2 years ago .
sir , this is william brandt , a former colleague of hunt 's .
sir . hunt is in possession of a virtual red box that can only be open by you .
yes , sir . that 's what he calls it .
he couldn 't possibly be talking about that " syndicate "
and yet , here we have the central intelligence agency indicating otherwise .
i think our first priority is to move you to a secure location .
yes . unfortunately , it does .
it was a hypothetical brainchild of chief attlee .
a virtual red box which i alone would control
furthermore , i was given every assurance it never pass the planning stage .
these people have been duped by agent faust .
a specialist without equal , immune to any counter measures .
no person he cannot become .
and he has made you his mission .
hunt .
just relax , sir . everything is going to be alright .
uk relations to the american revolution .
chief attlee . kind of you to accepted our invitation .
we know you created the syndicate .
and you 've been desperately trying to cover it up .
that 's true .
namely , how you frame her .
the survival of the scottish church is at stake .
the answer is clear , is it not ?
and i will absolve you for the murder of john comyn .
it must be done quickly . in scone .
it 's next to the english garrison at perth .

they 're flying the dragon banner .
i accept .
i know you don 't much respect holy matters , but i do .
that wasn 't the plan , robert .
are you sure this is a good idea ?
and what happens if he kills you ?
the prince has served his purpose by raising the dragon banner .
the king has made it clear that we must do whatever it takes .
they have no rights .
take him to london .
the king will hang him for treason .
gold to those who lead us to robert the bruce .
and say what ?
john , you 're hurt . here , duncan . come here .
we can go to islay , to my home .
i heard a rumor you made yourself king ,
my men and i stood with wallace at falkirk .
there was no winning falkirk . you know that .

bob , i don 't feel you are getting across
i was very lucky to have my father singing in the church .
phenomenal . better than mine .
i was singing with my father and 50 more male voice .
1955 , you won first prize in wales .
that was one of the most important
and that time , i was a teacher for elementary school .
he knows how difficult it is , even with a beautiful voice .
so , in 1955 , i begin to study ,
i won a competition ,
i remember that we have the room , one in front of the other ,
it 's everything poetic and romantic and positive in life .
london is an incredible city ,
but to become a tenor , that 's another thing . it 's more unnatural .
that 's the most important thing .
when i was listening to luciano , you know ,
i felt like i could see his voice .
you can count molecules practically . it 's so clear .
there 's such tension of sound . my ears would ring .
luciano was the one and only . yes .
when i was born in this building ,
mv mother embraced me , and with all the women of this house ,
i was very much spoiled , loved , but even .. kept smart .
tibor made a career with luciano , taking him into stadiums ,
he said , " anything you do from here on in ,
he was branching out .
i feel ... it 's almost ... the feeling is that , eh ?
i thought they will have arguments who will sing which aria .
so we all rehearsed it on the spot .
so , we divide some of the numbers .
i think a good way to know a person
uh , the moment of being on the stage ,
.. spirit of the moment , you know ?
but , uh , we end the program ,
it was like a tidal wave .
all of a sudden , classical departments
it 's disgusting .
well , he was the most famous catholic
so they would devote quite a lot of the paper to it .
these days ,
there is no respect .
i should 've said , " you are wasting time . "
it was bad because , uh , i was suffering myself .
but they understand that i fell in love .
and now falling in love ... .. he caught it in the neck again .
aw , jeez .
wait . tohn .
yeah . john , amber 's almost as tall as me .
yeah , i know . she 's cute as hell , right ?
the girl sitting upstairs ?
john , shelly 's short .

john and i are having a bit of a problem here .
now john here has eyesight problems
marconi 's like 50 years old .
we 're not your nemesis .
you lie ! no no no , we 're in the same business .
last night you had a dream , arnie .
she was lashing you with a whip
a lot better
bullshit . what it gets is worse .
it started just a couple of years ago .
so that friend of mine , john ,
no , wait . where are we gonna go ?
what ? no . no . no .
hey , let 's go to your place or something . any place but here .
that jamaican guy ..
that stuff , dave ,
john , answer my question .
i don 't know ! that 's what i 'm trying to say !
andy and those guys , they didn 't want to come .
and you still actually tried that shit ?
dave , please please please ,
saint dom 's .
well , this is father shelnut .
do you .
look , people say they see things
other people have ... no , i didn 't mean to imply that .
and then even if you need to see a professional ,
being crazy , mentally ill .
i mean , you can 't diagnose yourself with the same organ that has the disease ,
but let 's just suppose that i actually
i 'll try to explain this without cursing ,
uh , hello ? are you still there ?
just keep calm , okay ?
i could feel it , that strange venomous warmth
i 'm starting to think there 's nothing you can do to help me .
we both know you 're fucked .
vanna. ahh !
john , wake up !
my name is roger north .
my interest is only in you .
a very important role you must play .
things are in motion , mr. wong .
they harvest insects here , do they not ? for their honey ?
have you ever noticed
i 've been watching you for some time ,
so , uh ..
that 's a drug , right ?
it makes you smarter when you take it .
it heightens your senses , i think .
you can see things you shouldn 't be able to .
i 'm getting to that .
you 're on it right now
on an actual day in the future , arnie ,
think about that . now ,
shit ! what the shit is that ?
how the fuck did you do that ?
there 's no name for it in this world .
wait . no no no no . you ..

so let 's make up a batch .
i 'm on my way out , i have a ton of errands .
no , i can 't .
we 're just having a few laughs . what 's the big deal ?
just go out there and tell him to go home .
i 've been plenty supportive .
now , tim is my guest and he will go home when i say so .
tim , it 's time for me to go sleepy-bye .
yeoh .
so ...
i don 't suppose i could get some of that ?
and over the years , we 've had so many young people come to our ministry
hi , honey ! look at my new shoes .
honey , i 'm trying to watch the game .
how 'd you buy new shoes ?
no , i wanna talk about it now .
girl meets boy , boy buys girl things ,
i forgot how generous men could be .
what are you talking about ?
i don 't need your money .
uh .. before you go ..
don 't get your hands all over them .
last thing i need 's a case of pink eye .
you know what my mom said to me last night ?
can you believe that ?
but the only way you can know
oh , you 're one of those witty people ?
you kinda remind me of a game show host .
it strikes me that if you wanna be the strong silent type ,
i suggest you keep the bullshit to a minimum .
no , you act tough now , but we 'll be friends .
yeah , i find that hard to believe
your mother 's . get in .
getting pulled over with drugs makes you really late .
you may never refuse an order and you may never quit .
do not socialize with the locals .
in time you two might take over the operation ,
where 's the boss ?
sleep well ? all nested in ?
you can if you want
you see that
they don 't have their real father .
he ran me off , so i 'm not there to protect ' em .
yeah
excuse me , ma 'am ?
i spent years training my brain to race
why didn 't we run as soon as we found him dead ?
bright 's ? with frog 's money ?
peter pan , pcp .
this is button 's number
but it turns out it doesn 't fit .
a couple months ago .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
bright needs the money back .
how do i know he ain 't lying ?
it 's ... yeah . it 's just all ... it 's all complicated .
what are we gonna do with the money we got from this run ?
frog will probably be impressed we held onto it this long , you know ?
how much you think he knows ?
maybe he knows about every piss we take .
and don 't say to ask swin .
he doesn 't tell me a thing .
well , at this moment we have no plans to leave .
you don 't need to tell me anything exact , but ..
i mean , if you got caught , how long a sentence are we talking ?
yeah , i don 't know anyone who had good parents .
we 're drug runners .
we make runs all through the south down to florida ...
a few weeks ago a guy followed us back from a run and killed bright .
if we were gonna run away we 'd have done it already ..
who am i kiddin ' ?
we might as well live up at bright 's house .
this weekend .
i can 't this weekend , we got work .
he is determined
i didn 't wanna torture you .
yep . i take it , uh , mr. bright ain 't available ?
anybody thirsty ?
we should do that .
you know what 's funny ?
you boys are here , just hangin ' out .
seem a bit suspicious to you ?
oh , my god . don 't look , don 't look .
hey , look at me . don 't look at him .
it 's okay .
come on back with the gatlin 's .
check it out
how much for an oil change ?
we can read .
what does your aunt think you do all day ?
she believes what we tell her .
well , she 'd think we was off to college .
we think it ain 't gonna work out .
happens i 'm lookin ' for some help .
you guys wanna try workin ' for me ?
oh , uh .
i 'm only gonna say this one time , so listen the fuck up .
i 'm the boss .
if you decide to run off .
you 're not allowed to bring girls around ,
you take the damn thing out right now .
we need to expand .
we 're gonna have to set up some high-end exclusives .
i think you can grow the business any damn way you wanna grow the business .
i trust you
the only mistake my mentor ever made ,
yeah , it 's time i handed it over .
it does to me
sleep late , go to bed early , sell people shit
right . like true capitalists
i wonder what your rude friend wants to do if i don 't have a packet , hmm ?
now , it 'll be suicide , ' cause i 'm giving you a fuckin ' warning .
all i brought are my big strong hands .
is this an order from frog ?
i mean , i had already figured out my design .
get it ? that 's cute , right ?
is it time to open the gifts yet ? i need to sit down .
oh , come on , mer .
hell , i barely made it through high school biology , so ...
and you 're gonna hear words like " ' pseudomonas " and " emboli . "
those things are part of the evidence .
shh .
and during this time we will establish that dr. torres
and we will establish that all of this started
we 've gotta get him off this table .
wait , the sponge count is off .
are you kidding me ?
sats are continuing to drop . switching to manual ventilation .
you want me to call for a portable x-ray ?
b.p. ' s dropped to 70 over 40 .
are you sure you don 't want me to call for ...
all right , we 're closing him up .
well , you know , uh , we have to . lap pads .
he 's burning up . he won 't eat .
how are you feeling . travis ?
dr. torres , you wanna take a listen to this ?
is that a murmur ?
oh , wow .
whitney , i don 't want you to worry .
so we 're just gonna go in and clean it all out , okay ?
so first , we 've got to clean out that joint , okay ?
okay . should i call yang ?
we 've got to get in there
oh , damn it !
i 'm gonna have to remove the whole thing .
well , for now .
you think i 'll like being pregnant ?
oh , except for the nausea . oh , and the stretch marks .
and the lack of sleep , the exhaustion .
no booze .
you mentioned the trial like it was nothing .
you know how many times i 've been sued ?
he 's very good . technically , his tactics are legal .
of course i did . of course i did .
arizona 's gonna bring her by in an hour .
wh-what 's going on ?
i really don 't wanna talk about it .
a couple months ago .
i just , i didn 't wanna get into it , dad .
mom hasn 't spoken to me since the wedding .
his infected heart .
i can hear you two from all the way the damn hallway .
yeah , tell cristina to back off and let me do mine .
well , he can live without a leg .
look , if you do the heart tomorrow ,
cristina , this is travis reed we 're talking about .
what 's his temp ?
what 's going on ?
what aren 't you telling me ?
what the hell is wrong with my legs ? !
it 's ... too early to panic .
there she is .
that 's what i told him , but he insisted on coming .
kepner 's a terrible driver .
i did extensive research on the peterson hip .
everyone agreed that travis was an ideal candidate .
the cut position and the femoral resurfacing were perfect .
we thought he might have a clot in his lungs ,
yes .
well , the patient 's life was at risk .
i made a call , and i was right .
so leaving the sponge was deliberate .
you weren 't being careless or distracted .
dr. yang wanted to do the heart surgery first .
yes .
well , his foot was turning gray .
and i wanted to restore blood flow .
according to dr. yang 's testimony , she wanted to go first
uh , a little .
and then it spreads to your curtains .
do you put out the grease fire ?
which disaster do you tackle first ?
i was just picking which disaster to tackle first .
i 'm not trying to pick a fight .
okay , well , i feel like crap , too .
i know . i know that .
flu 's got their staff laid up . they need bodies .
you think ? you think they 'd let us temp together ?
why don 't i just ask chestnut to kick me in the head ?
fifth floor , end of dreams .
you know the toaster oven in our kitchen ?
hi . caroline channing , reporting for my first day .
hey , i 'm temp number two . where your bathroom at ?
'cause sister , you fine .
yes , right there on your breasts , beverly .
the doug ? love your harassment work !
wow , beverly ,
yep .
oh , i love this .
max , i 'm pouring you more champagne
you are now a junior executive 's executive assistant !
max , think about it .
you wouldn 't have to decide
come on , it could be so fun .
is this the woman who sexually harassed you ?
oh , good one ! really funny .
come on , you 're not even my type .
trust me , i 've been through four of these .
hey .
we , it 's amazing what a week without chemo can do .
when does the last round start ?
and i was hoping we could put that time to good use .
bree watch this !
i just think if 's tacky to have a baby shower when it 's not your first baby .
hint , hint .
and we can play games , ke " how big is mummy 's tummy ? "
you just warmed up the goodness i bought at the store .
you know , not all neighbors have to be friends .
mike , they live 15 feet from us .
i wouldn 't blame you if you stormed out right now .
i 'm here to celebrate our renewed friendship ...
or should i say babies ?
oh , um ...
i 'm off to the bank .
okay.have fun .
no , no .
i thought you took a sleeping pill .
aunt lily , what 's going on ?
i was a wonderful mother to rex .
why were you barely ever here ?
he knew you hated me .
i come downstairs to make breakfast , and there he is ,
if i wanted a drunk homo on my couch ,
okay ? you broke into a neighbor 's house
i got a little confused , and ...
you got to admit , all these places kind of look the same .
calm down , all right ?
you need to be very careful .
what ?
in a " jesus saves " sports bottle .
tables and chairs go out back ,
what do you think ? it 's for our party tomorrow night .
oh , why wouldn 't we be ?
why ? she wasn 't even invited .
brain-dead . big difference .
she 's very much alive .
i don 't care what they told you .
that 's not what 's happening here . this was beth 's idea .
as far as i 'm concerned , they mean nothing .
oh , it 's nothing official , just when i 'm needed .
um .. they prefer to remain anonymous .
the old drunk guy from outside the supermarket ?
it 's a wonderful program .
i 'm sorry .
what ?
tom scavo ... i know that guy .
well , carlos is always bragging about you .
what 's not to love about tom scavo ?
wow , this is amazing .
well , we just found something not to love about tom scavo .
carlos is a close friend , and we 're just starting
you could try . it never hurts to put in an offer .
this conversation isn 't over . i hope you 're gonna
that 's not fading is scaring the hell out of me .
what 's the matter with you ? whatever happened to integrity ?
it got a better offer from glenn and turned into prosperity .
okay . um .. it looks like we have a little time left .
elvis ?
okay . you know ...
you know , i have the same kind of problem with ... my mother .
she 's such a control freak
we 're trying to heal here .
like in the tenth grade ,
or does she sound like a loving mother
yeah , it is hard work making dinner
i 'm sorry , but we 're here to stop drinking , not criticize
now let 's just join hands and recite the serenity prayer .
grant me the serenity
you 're still having that thing ? a woman 's on life support .
put roy and me down for a " no , " but please ,
are you nuts ? in case you haven 't heard , our friend
oh . i got her name wrong . how disrespectful .
for what ?
wow . is he asleep already ?
not even harry potter could keep him awake tonight .
i turned her away because she did .
she ...
i believe she can . you must believe it , too ,
i 'm praying for forgiveness .
now we have to stop .
hi . can i come in ?
i 'm on my way to a meeting
you won 't go back ? even for me ?
look , i don 't need to go , all right ? i 'm fine .
don 't get me wrong . i have plenty of problems .
but it is a very generous offer ,
look , our friendship aside .
and if i had the cash ...
a ... and a car allowance .
" here 's your allowance , tommy . good luck on your paper route . "
carlos might as well call you " king of all important things "
wow . this is some crowd .
well , just shows you how little you know
what ? no .
mrs. solis ? i was going to call you .
of course . i mean , if you think you 'll make it back
a good hostess knows the best parties
renee , look , i ...
i don 't get it . why have a party
renee ! i know you didn 't like beth , but come on . she 's dying .
whoo .
or fly .
he said 4 : 00 , but they don 't close till 6 : 00 .
yeah . let 's be a little late .
would it be okay if i came in for a moment ?
neil , we 've been chatting with candidates about the program .
do you have any thoughts on that decision ?
what do you see as the challenges ?
we 're putting you in command of gemini 8 .
we get the agena back online ,
we 'll put that brain of his to work .
two . one .
it 's not the agena . it 's us .
this is cso , checking our comm link .
gemini 8 , how do you read ?
we 're tumbling end over end up here .
okay , we got your spacecraft
well , i 'd like to argue with them
i just keep thinking , is there anything else that we forgot ?
gemini 8 saw two complex vehicles
all of which is tended to be overshadowed
you mentioned that the rate of revolution
did you think to use the agena
this was , uh , not successful .
not me .
so you better start thinking about what you 're gonna say .
well , we 're not sure we 're gonna get onto the moon .
how long will you be gone ?
what 's quarantine ?
uh , to protect in case we , uh ...
i 'm sorry for dropping in so suddenly but ,
oh , that was very thoughtful of you . how much do i owe you ?
qh , thank you .
what have you been doing ?
what 's it about ?
just what the world needs .
how 's it coming ?
oh , i .
what would get you breathing again ?
hmm .
you 're looking a little glum .
i thought maybe some time had passed , you know ?
against my better judgment .
the awards the kids to rank . frank doesn 't even look after the
they 're crying . they 're crying
and they sit underground all day .
and now he 's gonna switch custody to frank ?
because he 's friendly in some way with frank 's lawyer .
1t doesn 't make sense .
it doesn 't matter .
we tried . my lawyer tried and failed .
it 's just so unfair .
if he doesn 't postpone it again ,
i wish i could take the kids and move to europe .
what , and hide for the rest of your life ?
i hope the judge gets cancer .
because wishing doesn 't work .
but you 'd never be able to pull it off ,
i could rid you of this roach and end all your suffering
wow , god . i got a little dizzy in there .
are you all right ?
i have medicine at home .
yeah , i don 't know why i feel so dizzy .
the idea of helping this woman , of taking action ,
it was a high-stakes risk , but the risk made me feel alive .
you know , he 's a rotten judge , not impartial as he 's vowed to be ,
t mean .
he 's a roach who 'd be better stamped out .
i was too excited to fall asleep .
yeah , i think i know what your strong suit is
it 's one of my favorite places in the world .
i can 't help thinking of that phrase by emily dickinson ,
you think you are .
the correct road for you is with that terrific guy you 're going with .
i 'll always be your friend .
that was fantastic .
aw . i don 't deserve all the credit . you are hot stuff , lady .
christ , you were like a caveman .
you know ? just a limitless freedom .
where ? to talhiti ?
now put it out of your mind .
he lived alone on a pretty street within walking distance to the courthouse .
he was a member and ate there pretty often .
he was not well-thought of as a judge and had been censured once or twice ,
because , you know , continental philosophy deals with
i never thought i would get you to go to an amusement park .
studying
there was no question there was something lighter about abe .
the impact of luck and random chance ,
hey .
what do you mean ? i think it 's a little late for that .
i know . and i love roy .
then i have to be the responsible one and keep things from getting out of hand .
i was sure abe had feelings for me .
i tried telling myself the reason he wasn 't letting anything go too far
the more he tried not to let anything serious happen ,
it was artistically challenging to plan how to do away with spangler
careful not to leave any record on my computer ,
and while it would be impossible to obtain any legally ,
what are you doing here ?
april , yeah .
i 'm doing research for a book i 'm working on .
well , i 'm glad to see you 're wearing rubber gloves
actually , wait . while i have you here
yeah , so , it 's due on friday and basically ,
i 'm fine , i just don 't want to go to the concert .
well , i 'm sorry , roy . i just had a change of heart .
you have a boyfriend . i 'm not going to get in the way of that .
i don 't believe you .
don 't wanna tak about it .
you know , he must 've had a lot of enemies .
i know , but you know , i still can 't say i 'm sorry .
i don 't know ...
well , what , what did the police say ?
not in battle or self-defense ,
today we 're gonna discuss existential choice .
and we 'll examine jean-paul sartre 's wonderful insight ,
police still have no clues
they said that speculation that the poison had been intended
i love that you notice those things .
sights and sounds , the taste of food and wine .
what are you thinking ?
uh-huh , and how did i perform that little miracle ?
i mean , you couldn 't and you wouldn 't .
mmm .
yeah , i mean , if i had to eliminate someone , i think i 'd
was it cyanide ? the papers didn 't say that .
oh , that 's funny . i always assume arsenic for some reason .
old movies or something . it had to be someone that knew him .
or i guess it was juice , wasn 't it ?
it was like sitting at a tense poker table ,
that rules oult a friend
maybe he turned his back .
well , aren 't those take-out juices covered with a straw ?
basically , we had this long conversation .
and he said that he felt like i wasn 't being fair to him .
you would love abe . he is so interesting
because who on the faculty has not slept with rita richards ?
oh , god , here we go .
you know , the guy who 's all over the papers ?
and still , walking home , i passed abe 's house ,
and i felt guilty and stupid .
and yet on his desk was a copy of crime and punishment ,
jill !
and yet , if it turned out to be that he did it ,
i 'd still let him take me to spain .
i still felt justified in what i 'd done .
a man who took advantage of his power to hurt others .
but then things took on a new twist .
" police are certain they have the person'
well , i couldn 't have done it on my own , so thanks .
i mean , seriously , you know , he 's crazy .
i mean , he 's just got a death wish , that 's all . that 's no skill .
yeah . she said they got a serious ticket
fifty grand .
if you get a hold of that thing and bring it here ,
mr lin gets the rest , and you 're even .
hey !
is mr lin president of the united states ?
you do not do this !
yeah , there you go . see ?
fourteen minutes . i timed it .
that ticket you were talking about ?
yeah , the goddamn dentist . is that a good enough reason for you ?
well , a man 's gotta do what a man 's gotta do .
i told you one thing , and you almost ruined it all .
nima . you gotta start trusting somebody . please , tell me .
wilee ? what are you doing here ?
you can 't have delivered already , it 's not possible .
where is my envelope ?
where is it ?
yeah , and another one just came and picked it up .
hey .
someone else come and pick it up ?
why ?
so , what was that thing i was carrying ?
what 's the money for ?
why are there a million tools in here and nothing to open a beer ?
so who 's gonna pick it up ?
shit .
baby , this situation sucks . i don 't want you anywhere near it .
you know how sexy you are when you talk like that ?
i 'll call you when i deliver .
count on it .
hey , wilee , i got an idea . why don 't you race me for it ?
we 'll go through the park . enter on 106 .
you don 't got the legs for it , man .
manny !
manny can 't hear you , manny 's moving too fast .
not a problem for me , baby . i 'll just drop into my little ring .
what kind of bike messenger are you ?
you still haven 't answered my original question .
you wanna know what scares me
compared to that , going down broadway at 50 with no brakes is fine .
it also sounds like bullshit .
i need the cavalry , bro .
roadrunner .
really ?
this is johnny .
well , tell him i got it .
yeah , i have the money .
he knows everything going on in that mosque .
my curiosity is killing me .
golden rule of counter-terrorism , remember ?
jess ?
same van was reported stolen three days ago .
i don 't know . where are we ?
all of them have been false alarms ,
you 'd just be reopening a case .
yeah , let 's pretend that that 's all we 'd be doing .
ihavetoleave in two weeks .
please , help me do this .
are you up for a little field work ?
which ones ?
guess i always knew he 'd be back , too .
so i should what , ignore the lead ?
come on , you were brought here to fight terrorism .
what makes you think i 'm not fighting terrorism ?
why don 't you spare yourself ?
spare myself . right .
god , i hope you 're wrong about this .
i don 't think i could live with that .
um , a detective named guerrero .
no . no , i thought it might reflect badly on the office ,
thank you . i appreciate it .
leave all this with me , get back to your c-t work .
no , i can take care of that .
well , it 's not a problem for me , sir , to put out a field report .
understood .
you really are a dumb son of a bitch , siefert !
you find the nearest muslim and you ring him up !
who are you protecting ?
jesus god .
that guy in that stupid picture of yours ?
why is that ? who is he ?
hey , what 's your brilliant idea ,
i 'll put an extra dollar in your paycheck , i swear to god !
all right , let me have it .
bump , give me ..
give me the ..
p.o. took one look at those pictures ,
uh , said , " if i had the time to do it ,
your table , as i recall .
wasn 't much of a surprise .
and the p.o. doesn 't recall beckwith
i do it when i 'm anxious . you 're making me anxious .
because i caught the case .
morales put me on it .
that son of a bitch !
you 're gonna have to explain that .
let me , uh ... i ..
i like the one on page 90 , by the way .
you 'd break .. break hearts in that dress .
yeah , really sweet , ray . come with me .
please tell me i 've been misinformed .
there 's a case to be made , sir .
and no participation from the actual cop investigating the case .
hmm ? no warrant .
my sense was that your enthusiasm for the target was low , sir .
jesus christ .
half the families in my neighborhood
you don 't have his van , you don 't have shit !
no , i 'd let a rapist-murderer go free !
you 'd charge him , politics aside ?
i think you like looking back more than i do .
okay . let 's look forward .
i think you should go back to new york .
because i don 't like where this is going ,
i got two broken ribs from a shovel says it 's there .
your killer knew enough to douse the victim thoroughly inside and out
what is your level of education , mr. marzin ?
less than that ?
this one likes to sit in his room and draw comic books with monsters ,
i killed him about a month after you left .
you understand you 're speaking to an officer of the court ?
jess ...
it 's okay .
i would 've left him alone , i want you to know that .
i knew , if morales could do that ,
it had to be me .
maybe he already has .
where have you been ?
already a million words under his belt before columbia
excuse me . can you direct me to the space needle ?
um ... sure , okay .
and then you turn north and then you should ...
hey , that 's not west .

like some 16-year-old girl

doing otherwise would be unethical .
can you believe this guy ?
how do you know i didn 't do them ?
good morning , everybody .
bernadette , here 's your soy peppermint mocha .
yes , gabrielle had always been a demanding shopper .
because she knew there are some purchases .. that can 't be returned .
at 11 : 43 , dr. hanson mills cut the umbilical cord , forever separating mother and child .
oh , yeah , that 's the plan . i swear .
sure .
next morning , i woke up in an alley .
first , we should probably talk about how much money i want .
money can never exchange hands .
oh , but can 't they also buy me gifts ?
sure we 'll find some way to express our gratitude .
well , my lunch break is over , so i have to get back to the club .
oh , it 's actually pronounced solis .
uh , it 's mexican .
huh . i figured you were italian .
wow , she 's .. gorgeous .
is this libby 's real hair color ?
and i know she 's athletic because she 's a pole dancer ,
susie , baby ?
i didn 't realize you had company . hello , ladies .
just wheel me .
did he just call her " baby " ?
let 's not fight about it.it 's over .
no . no , no , no .
and i 'm gonna get it .
thank you .
penny , darling . darling .
hi , miss ham .
thank you so much , miss ham . for everything .
she had just fallen . the doctor said she didn 't suffer .
you train for them , too , don 't you ?
i work for them sometimes . so what ?
who the hell do you think you are ? coming here , accusing me ?
and i 'm not " missy " anything . get your things and get off my farm !
if i ever even hear your name again , i will see that you go to prison !
at his club , every day .
uh , miss ? uh ... miss , you can 't ...
i told her this was a gentleman 's club , and she just ...
thank you , seth . i apologize for interrupting .
thank you .
i fired earl jansen .
does that mean you 're selling the horses or keeping them ?
but i 'm not willing to sell it unless i get what it 's worth .
well , i 've got a family back in denver .
you need to talk to lucien laurin . he 's a french canadian .
he 's trying to retire .
mr. laurin ?
and , um , i need a trainer . bull hancock suggested that i find you .
i 've lost interest in racing . don 't even follow it anymore .
they go where there is a good horse .
no , you don 't . you have one or two that might be worth the time ,
miss , you 're not hearing me . a trainer makes his living off commissions .
to get a top trainer , you need a top horse .
mr. laurin , two of our mares are pregnant by bold ruler
fore !
well , i yelled " fore , " you idiot . that 's what " fore " means .
he had great stamina , jack .
what ? sire and dam and sam-1-am ?
come home .
you about ready ? we 're ready .
hi . good to see you , mr. hancock . how are you ?
i called jack about our tax issues , and he told me you fired our trainer .
he was dishonest . he had to go . you came down here because of a trainer ?
i checked with some of phipps ' people .
so that 's who we 'll choose .
somethingroyal 's colt could have an unusual mix of speed and stamina .
come on .
and i do hope you 've inherited his luck .
mr. phipps has the call as the owner of bold ruler .
hasty matilda or somethingroyal .
well , that 's that .
you got what nobody else wanted . time to go home .
no , thank you , i have daddy 's truck here .
so , who won the coin toss ?
of course he did .
pigs ! pigs . they 're all such pigs !
now the teacher says it 's too political and we can 't put it on .
they have a rule that theater projects can 't be political .
if you didn 't disclose until today , they couldn 't be held liable for a breach .
honey , listen . if this is really important to you , you won 't ...
i just realized that 's the first time i 've laughed ,
ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the fourth race at aqueduct ,
and they 're off .
you said he was ready to race .
fourth ? and he runs like he 's afraid ? i expect more than that .
don 't start with me . you are off him !
and you stay out of this . it 's none of your business .
the horse should never have lost .
say that in english .
horse needs a jock with more experience .
if his jockey won 't back off , red won 't back off . from anything !
i want to meet with him . when i 'm back in two weeks .
but don 't ever say this is none of my business .
yes , ma 'am .
mr. turcotte . oh , i 'm so sorry .
i 'll be ready . why wouldn 't i be ?
they say you 're one of the best . you got a great touch .
they also say that you can be over-aggressive .
then why did you come to me ?
i read here that the last horse you were on ran so hard his heart burst ?
lucien told the truth .
that you 're hard as nails .
i 'm not afraid . neither are they .
it 's true . the last horse i rode ran so hard his heart burst .
you want somebody else , get somebody else .
i want you .
so which of you ladies owns secretary ?
and he 's going to make your horse take dictation .
doesn 't matter . mine 's the big red one . and he 's going to beat them all .
i see him .
it 's a beautiful day at saratoga park .
we 're ready for our six
and they 're off !
come on , ronnie , make your move !
ok , red . let 's go get them !
but there is another option .
due to his outstanding two-year-old season ,
so we sell secretariat .
and the sons of bold ruler , they 're long on speed , but short on stamina .
but he didn 't . and now i 've got secretariat .
daddy used to always say that rich people are rich
no son of bold ruler has ever won a single triple crown race .
you 're going to lose the farm and the horse , everything .
nobody has .
well ..
... and work is good for grief .
howard keck on line one , bunker hunt on line two .
i was calling about a select opportunity on secretariat .
no , we are moving to syndicate his breeding rights .
yes , sir . it 's a great opportunity .
look , seth , i 've been a part of lots of these deals ,
tell mr. chenery 's little girl that she 's priced this colt
dr. todd , please . it 's elizabeth ham .
all due respect , but i got a pretty good handle on where i want to be .
yes , mr. cleaver , it 's lots of money . but my father used to tell me
is it a full set ?
they won 't stain .
and say what ?
she 'll deny ever having seen tm .
well , we have to do something .
and then we 'll call the police .
oh , think you do .
it can happen so quickly .
in the time it takes to tell a wife her husband won 't be home for dinner .
yes , life as we know it can change ...
jane 's still running a fever .
do you think we should call her husband ?
let 's try vancomycin .
i don 't want ian to worry .
alan , this is mike delfino .
sorry i couldn 't start on your case sooner .
susan and i are happy to be of assistance .
sure .
don 't you love this guy ?
what kind of a strategy is that ?
that 's still ten years in prison .
with good behavior , he could be out in five .
we need to find a lawyer who believes that he 's innocent .
you 're letting your feelings for him cloud your judgment .
are we gonna do this again ?
oh , honey ...
do you really mean that , or are you manipulating mommy into feeling incredibly guilty ?
yep .
the suspense is killing me .
yes your mother told me about bree 's little discovery .
well , maybe i threw them away .
you might find them , if the police don 't find them first .
well , neither will you now .
why don 't you do us all a favor and go away ?
don 't bother crying .
they won 't work now .
when i 've been fine for three of them .
lynette ?
you 're the one who said that we need the street fair .

he 's been sending her all sorts of stuff to bribe her , even a diamond bracelet .
our zach young ?
his grandfather left him all that money .
oh ! this crust is fantastic !
it 's not your only secret , is it , lynette ?
how 's the arm ?
oh , don 't feel guilty . i 'm sure we burned it off on the dance floor .
where 'd you learn how to salsa ?
when did i say that ?
and i knew you liked that merlot from your " vogue " interview .
i hate to dish my best friend on her deathbed ...
it was five years ago .
i 'm just stunned .

poor ian .
there 's so much i want to say .

they plan meticulously , they nurse long grudges ,
nate haskell likes to kill people one at a time .
he 's not one for mass murder .
yes .
someone with a grudge against cops .
down a public road .
ralph is no criminal !
he took me and my brother when we didn 't have anyone .
and why ?
and you see what happens when we speak truth to power .

any other signs of trauma on the body ?
i guess we 're gonna have to flip her .

sheldon , why is this letter in the trash ?
it 's from the institute for experimental physics .

because i have no interest in standing in the rose room
i don 't know , sheldon .

no , we don 't .
everything else is optional .
you can 't . i 'm the lead author .
i let you think we went alphabetically
you 're welcome .
it doesn 't need proving .
they 're not supposed to , but they should .
and i forbid it .
if i 'm not taking credit for our work , then nobody is .
once again , i 'm throwing you a bone .
oh , no , he didn 't
not only is he still not talking to me ,
never mind .
it says , i know my physics , but i 'm still a fun guy .
they don 't.that 's why i saved this one .
okay , here , take this ..
is this all stuff you want me to try on ?
oh. seriously , don 't even give them to charity .
what 's this ?
galileo and the pope had a little misunderstanding .
well , how do you feel ?
no , i 'm just asking if it 's difficult
i wonder if i 've been experiencing
i couldn 't poop this morning .
i 'm sure you guys can work this out .
which was ?
okay , so you absolutely should talk to him .
excuse me . " little idea " ?
i didn 't really understand it ..
i didn 't skip it. it 's just an anecdote .
oh , i see .
you are not isaac newton .
gravity would have been apparent to me without the apple .
you continue to underestimate me , my good man .
because i knew you 'd screw this up .
but it was straight downhill from there .
maybe i didn 't go to college when i was 11 like you .
yeah . we can do it .
whoa , nelly.no , this is sweet ,
lynette 's marriage is falling apart .
the ... turtles .
it 's nothing .
it was . it is ! this is just a setback :
it 's gettin ' a little heated over here !

i do , every second of every day .
bree says trip knows what he 's doing ,
you 'd be throwing your whole life away ,
please , let 's just see how this plays out .
for sale
don 't tell me you 've changed your mind .
if his testimony is damaging in any way ,
she has some connection to this .
you have to do what i say .
i know . i am deeply sorry for this whole mess .
i 'm really not in the mood for tea and biscuits .
i wish there was something i could do .
because now i know .
he doesn 't want to be married to me .
orange is not my color .
i saw bree.her clothes were kinda muddy , um ...
was she carrying anything ?
what was she carrying ?
no further questions .
i did what i had to do . i told the truth .
do you not understand what 's at stake here ?
oh , so i 'm one of the " friends " now ?
all year long you 've been keeping a secret from me .
you need to tell me what happened that night .
you 're gonna lose .
you 're scaring me .
you 're throwing your life away , and it-and it pisses me off ,
you 're not just my client , and i 'm not just your lawyer .
oh , to hell with it .
you have to promise me not to use this against him ...
tell me everything .
this gem just came on the market ,
i just love your kitchen .
i don 't think that story 's gonna be enough gaby .
he came over , he started attacking me ,
i was just thinking how proud i am of you .
you were just saving ... how much you wanna change ,
i love you very much , gabrielle ,
i was at that progressive dinner pany .
okay.that could be helpful .
look at me.l 'm wearing a wig and toting an oxygen tank .
gaby 's running late .
listen , if they take me into custody right away ,
you need to tell them that i love them
well , you will in a minute , honey .
that 's just the way it has to be .
after everything he 'd done to her ..
what the hell was that ?
she begged me to put her on the stand .
obviously.she needed to get this off her conscience .
you can 't possibly allow this .
okay , ms . stone , what do you want to do ?
your honor , at this time ,
given her advanced age and declining health ,
always be the love of my life .
what do you mean i 've moved on ?
yeah , i am .
well , it 's no big deal . it 's just ...
ohh , you 're busy .
and my new neighbor made it her mission to find out
it was just after breakfastwhen susan delfino told her friends
yeah , a long distance move can be tough on a relationship .
although in paris , it 's hard to tell the difference .
so ... what team are you playing for now ?
what 's ... wrong ?
they 're really trusting me . what if i can 't do it ?
you deserve this .
i just gotta learn how to be the boss .
yeah , l think our gardener would agree .
so how you been feeling ?
but that 's okay , right :
please stop calling .
well , you 're half right .
i did , more than i 've liked anybody in a very long time .
ashvsash.cyech , didn 't want to brag in front of the girls but it 's worth a few bucks .

i love doing that !
renee 's wedding . i just wanted to check on karen before i left .
oh , roy . i am ... so sorry.would you like me to stay ?
oh , good ! you found karen 's record .
trip ?
the son of a gun must 've gone to 20 different record stores .
you should 've seen the smile on her face when he brought it in .
do you seriously need to stretch out on her ?
ohh ! do you have to keep doing that ?
hey ! oh , don 't lie to me !
now that is beautiful .
when 's her wedding ? three months .
handsome lanyard .
$ 5,000 with my employee discount .
ow ! ohh ! oh , that was a big one !
keep breathing !
yeahyeah , yeah . told you i was a big shot here .
um , there 's only one tiny hiccup .
okay , all right , again , late for your own wedding.maybe kill this guy later .
you have no idea what i had to go through to get here .
i 've never seen anyone look so beautiful .
no , no , katherine , i am excited.i just need to talk to tom first .
almost .
they just prove that you 're human .
so what happens now ?
why ? it was a joke .
i did what i did with iohn rowland ?
you can 't make jokes about it . it 's too painful .
you knowit was the most shameful thing in my life , too .
i had this beautiful wife , but i focused on all the wrong things .
i guess that 's the point i was making hiring carmen .
i never want to go back to that again .
it 's infiltrated her spinal canal in three places .
it 's going to take 3 or 4 hours just to get around those nerves .
you never know what vessels are involved .
i 'm going to need a good head start .
if i miss a step , she 's paralyzed .
so she won 't mind if she can 't walk .
she 's been living under this thing , for how long ?
why would anyone wait this long , unless they wanted to die ?
doesn 't mean they want to die .
slightly better than if we do nothing .
you were already thinking it , i 'm just saying .
dr. shepherd .
yes , but he 's not interested .
it is not my job to push him into anything
since you 're clearly uncomfortable with my decision .
it 's minor procedure. you won 't be missed .
so i 've heard .
i won 't lie to you .
am i going to die ?
she will have the surgery .
i think that is a very wise decision .
i 'm sorry , annie. did i upset you in some way ?
that 's how i live with myself .
dr. karev .
nothing . i-i don 't know .
if anything goes wrong
i didn 't realize she could hear me .
you 're banned from the or. mine or anyone else 's. all week .
it 's been growing for a year and a half .
it 's like she 's fatally lazy .
you can 't do me favors .
ok , ok .
i can take care of myself .
and you 'll get yourself out ?
don 't let me keep you .
dr. shepherd .
sorry i called you a jackass .
i did . twice .
if you don 't marry him , i will .
what we got ?
give him dopamine , ten mikes .
the resident was here an hour ago . i can 't reach him .
do something ! what 's the matter ?
no , no !
does he have a myocardial ischemia ?
page someone . page anyone .
you have to open him up , right here , right now .
get out of here now !
i can 't . i 've never seen it done .
do nothing , you 'll kill him faster .
six .
take a breath , dr. stevens .
walter , move out of the way .
don 't let them fall into the chest cavity .
oh , god. oh , god .
i can 't get this clot out .
his chest films were clean this morning .
he was in pea. there was no time .
we 're ok here . i need some retraction .
i got it .
needed all the glory for yourself , right ?
do you have any idea what i have been through ?
you forgot ? you forgot ? !
you are a hateful , hateful , lazy ,
can you give me a few days to track it down ?
oh . what 's the hurry ?
well , i 'll do what i can ,
if you can make this happen today ,
hello , mr. rat brain .
directions to the nearest soup kitchen ?
it 's on merton avenue .
sorry .
what 's that ?
which i would trade in a heartbeat for all of this .
that would be awful even without bert .
prepare your uterus for his gigantic offspring ?
i 'm gonna have to tell him the truth :
from linda nosenchuck , tammy rosenworcel ..
yeah , well , i don 't think we 're gonna get to do that today .
it seems like a good way to drink a milk shake
how did she get you to do yoga ?
oh , how many times do i have to say it ?
sheldon , take a break .
okay , if you support me , what was with that phone call ?
but if you care so much what i think ,
would you have asked me before you quit your job ?
thank you .
jack !
jack , you work in the wholesale warehouse in lowestoft .
that 's right .
so , here 's jack malik , the singing wholesaler ,
you ever thought about doing a wholesale-based song ?
you could call it , uh , " in my warehouse "
i could 've written every song of the rolling stones
tomorrow .
no , of course not .
i teach maths .
yeah , maybe you can , though .
and , although i like you , i ..
right .
lucy , ellie 's resigned from her post .
no " featuring cardi b , "
and , as a second wave , because of the miracle
so , let operation jack begin !
each week , a new tv show .
song , song , song . show , show , show .
fought for things i believed in and won ...
found a woman i loved .
lived my life with her .
is he the fucked up one ?
you can 't come in late and hijack the entire session .
did i hijack the session ?
what do you do ?
good luck with that .
maybe you want to talk about that .
shit , i have to take this . sorry . sorry .
this guy 's whole business is built on ripping people off .
bye , everybody !
it 's pretty confusing , right ?
well , it 's supposed to .
or , even better ,
basically , lewis ranieri 's mortgage bonds
but then they started running out of mortgages to put in them .
so the banks started filling these bonds with riskier and riskier mortgages .
that way they can keep that profit machine churning , right ?
so whenever you hear " subprime , " think
which means to " bet against "
we have to act now !
no one reads them . only the lawyers who put them together read them .
the housing market is propped up on these
through what instrument , michael ?
the bonds are too stable .
this is what i 'm gonna do . i am gonna get a bank
money is not money . that 's bad money .
let me ask you this . what company treats its customers
mark baum had built his career
but one day his rabbi told his mom why .
it 's the reason mark is studying so hard .
so has he found any ?
and he wasn 't afraid to let anyone know when and where
hi , honey .
there were no cabs . what was i supposed to do ?
at least i went .
okay .
fine . you know what ?
you have no idea the kind of crap people are pulling
you know what they care about ? they care about the ball game .
i think you should try medication .
you hate wall street . maybe it 's time to quit .
those bonds only fail
if you 'll excuse me , dr. burry , it seems like a foolish investment .
everyone 's wrong .
this is wall street , dr. burry .
my one concern is that when the bonds fail ,
you wanna bet against the housing market
unless the market crashes .
rather than prime .
hey , randall ! what 's with the dom ?
we just sold $ 200 million in credit swaps for mortgage bonds .
it 's fucking crazy , right ?
wait , wait . i didn 't know there were swaps on mortgages .
he must have gone off his zoloft or something .
no , it 's for real .
unfortunately , it 's in a place like this which i would never be .
i had fashion friends .
randall made the sale . can you believe it ?
that was just with deutsche . word is he hit half the town .
this is a certainty .
but our company is not comfortable with this investment . am i being clear ?
you can read our agreement .
we had an underlying
it 's all very logical .
in other words , we lose millions
hello , mark baum .
i had a personal thing this afternoon .
if frontpoint makes money for morgan stanley , i 'm happy .
we 're expecting to be expecting .
that 's exciting !
and danny moses . the optimist of the bunch .
which is the only reason they put up with his bullshit optimism .
it was this guy from deutsche
the abx is at ..
that 's weird . i haven 't heard a peep about that .
jared vennect . vennett .
do you smell that ?
this is your basic mortgage ..
have a seat .
there you go .
a few . there 's definitely some interest .
it 's just a meeting though , you know ?
people have meetings all the time . you know ?
brownfield fund ?
got it .
well , brownfield is its own money .
yeah .
of course . we 're doing $ 30 million right now .
wow .
these kind of trades are totally out of the question .
let 's call ben !
he happened to be jamie 's neighbor when they were in colorado
but ben was dark
every one of these vegetables is fresh from my garden .
what you got to do is get your soil off the petrochemicals .
it creates ammonium nitrate .
and not those tranken-seeds from monsanto .
when haven 't we crunched the numbers ?
i need you out of here .
oh , god . i hate this . this is a total waste of time .
there 's a housing development 45 minutes outside town .
well , i hope there are some cuban restaurants on the way there .
how is wanting to eat good food being chipper ?
what do these 20 for ?
what 's up , man ? what do you want ?
you want my landlord 's dog ?
i guess so .
" cause i 've been paying my rent .
seriously , man ,
" let 's just all calm down "
then $ 585 , 000 maybe 18 months ago .
he 'd let it go for that ..
no , no , no .
why is he selling ?
marlene , you 'd say they 're motivated , right ?
this house on the left , i would say they 're probably motivated .
oh , it 's just the gully .
told you .
ben rickert .
you 're a retired trader , okay ? no one is listening to your calls .
you think they 're not using it ?
ben rickert .
it 's charlie . i 'm here , too .
ben , you still there ?
i 'll be honest , gentlemen .
but that 's a good thing , right ?
cool
these things don 't make any sense !
i just called an old friend at bear .
yeah , i just had to wire bear and deutsche $ 70 , 000 .
it 's rigged .
we 're gonna lose everything .
can 't do that .
wait a minute . hold on , ben .
i think we should buy more swaps .
suck it up and pay up , fellas . we made a deal .
are you fucking kidding me ?
i mean , who are all these clowns ?
certainly . vennett says these are the people we 're betting against .
there he is .
gentlemen .
just remember . we 're here to gather information .
we 're not advertising our short position . all right ?
i know you got a big mouth , you like to run it .
okay . okay .
ladies and gentlemen .
profits are strong
now , in our residential sector ..
our rollout of those variable rate packages
sir , the q and a is after my statements .
mark baum really did that .
he said that , he took the call
but this uzi is fucking awesome !
and then i 'm rich as fuck and i got my house in aspen .
$ 40 million against the aa .
you understand perfectly , bob . you want the deal ?
pleasure .
your big mouth was a revelation .
you worried you and your swaps are getting played ?
try not to get too righteous and listen a little .
a real solid-gold asshole .
a " cdo manager " ?
i didn 't realize that there was anything to manage with cdos .
i do most of merrill lynch 's cdos .
the investors .
if the mortgage bonds that michael burry discovered
about 20 times .
it was at that moment in that dumb restaurant
" what the fuck is a synthetic cdo ? "
let 's say i bet $ 10 million on a blackjack hand .
okay , selena has a pretty good hand here , showing 18 .
that 's a really good hand for selena .
so , my odds are good . i 'm on a winning streak .
how could i lose , right ?
tn basketball it 's called the hot hand fallacy .
it changed me . it changed me into a person
there 's no perfect way to help .
so stop trying to fix the world .
you 're not a saint .
.. that he was having bad thoughts .
my first response was to offer him some money .
mortgage meltdown continued today .
the company immediately ...
good time for my voice to go ...
the manufacturing index also fell in the month of march ..
a warning that economic growth could slow .
i 'm gonna call my mom .
time and time and time again , i have gone to bat for you , mark !
she 's got some lungs on her . i 'm impressed .
there 's no fucking way . there 's no fucking way
so you know what they 're doing , huh ? you know what they 're doing , right ?
they 're selling their dog shit cdos , then they 2o to another bank
this is a massive story . who wouldn 't publish it ?
no , you don 't understand !
what am i supposed to do ?
casey , right now every bank in town is unloading these shit bonds
this level of criminality is unprecedented , even on fucking wall street .
it took me years to build my relationships on wall street .
sorry , garage band hedge fund that thinks it 's the apocalypse .
really ?
i 'm not gonna burn my reputation on your wild hunch .
totally fucking awesome to see you .
thanks , charlie . still living with your mom ?
mark baum again . call me .
who got the remittance data early ? i bet it 's goldman .
jared , it 's chaos down here . where are we ?
well , nobody 's buying cdo or mortgage bonds anymore
that 's good for us .
i heard from somebody who heard from somebody .
some heavy losses in the bond department .
okay .
bennie is smarter than i thought .
the premiums on the swap ate into his desk 's profit .
a lot .
tell me morgan stanley doesn 't hold the contracts on these swaps .
all this time i 've been trying to figure out who i 'm betting against ,
what 's your exposure ? $ 3 billion ?
i say when we sell !
dude , did you hear the news ?
holy shit !

it 's not a message , it 's a martingale .
are you fucking with me ?
a is the initial bet .
and n is the number of tries between the maximum and minimum bet .
that way the chances of winning are higher . it 's 50.5 % .
you guys never change .
it 's too bad i didn 't kill you when i had the chance .

this is not about you
don 't worry about stevens .
one of them . it 's a common procedure for seizure patients .
she wouldn 't be able to practice medicine anymore
no , but it 's ...
it 's unlikely , but it 's possible .
if the tumor doesn 't kill me first .
have you even done a wada test
but it would tell us whether or not she could function afterwards ,
the surgery is unnecessary . the tumor 's already symptomatic .
that 's a nice ring .
i have really long conversations with dead people
i have a brain tumor . am i really not gonna let them cut it out ?
it 's like ...
and then the next minute ,
and then i said , enough .
i 'll row crew in heaven or whatever .
it worked .
charlie , if we admit you ,
yes , it might .
uh , it will be months before i can even begin
and talk her out of a surgery you know nothing about .
what you did is not only inappropriate ... it is unprofessional .
you crossed the line , cristina .
noshe didn 't .
i 'm the one you should be yelling at right now .
unless you want to apologize to .
my mother disappeared right in front of me .
her dignity , her memory .
izzie is not your mother .

he 's apparently not happy about the breakup ,
i don 't know .
if you and bernadette broke up ,

okay .
hey , look .
oh , no , no . not a chance .
and we will do everything that we can to find it .
bailey ?

i need a little more retraction .
do you see where she 's got ..
yeah .
okay .
all right , there you go .
i want to try a primary resection on daniel
alex .
but can the child even withstand ?
i would think that you of all people ..
would fight for a woman to get paid at least as much as any man .
i mean , if you do not value her enough , then just ...
she deserves more , and you know it .
you don 't know . i am woman .
but i 've already mentored grey .
and now that i 'm chief of this hospital ,
let 's get you out of here .
thank you for not changing the locks .
maybe you 're right .

when you 're faced with the tough choices ,
what can you leave behind ?
anything else you need ?
okay .
there 's still a lot of epidural bleeding .
does it look like i have a second ?

dr. webber , i 'm a surgeon .
you have an attending assisting you
what ... wh-what are you not telling me ?
i don 't need to be here .
not a bad idea .
he has a few spinal fractures ,
whatever .
it was an accident .
nobody is looking out for you .
this isn 't a personal problem . this is a professional one .
also , it means that i have to worry about you ,
i didn 't mean to pry .
yes , i 'm married .
i want you to shut the door
this is not the end of my career .
that is the end of your islet cell trial ,
open it ...
and read the first page .
a lot of questions came up today

look , i get it .
you 're allowed to have some bumps in the road .
i set off some alarms .
sorry , sorry , sorry .
we have a bounty on deer .
go through them in nothing flat .
you like venison ?
it might need a freshen-up , but , uh ...
you guys got kids ?
we raised two kids in this house , my wife and i .
she 's gone now .
i 'm sorry to hear that .
it 's a branding and advertising agency .
i mostly write for women 's magazines .
this view is beautiful .
it 's the only house i ever lived in .
the entire valley used to be covered with the stuff .
foxglove is poisonous , isn 't it ?
come on , i 'm gonna give you the grand tour .
lots of privacy , huh ?
after i sell the house , cassidy , my daughter ,
yeah .
it 's not that bad .
what is necessary is that i protect my wife .
no guns on my property .
what do you got against guns ?
when i was 12 , my brother was gunned down in the street .
i 'm sorry for your loss .
hey , randall . you be careful with these vines .
okay , mr. peck .
babe , what are you doing ?
i keep hearing this creaking sound .
okay , well , we don 't know anything about this man ,
since day one .
oh , my god . you don 't see it ?
is he ? because his departure date just keeps moving .
okay , it 's simple . i want you to tell him ..
okay ? and if you can 't tell him ,
you don 't think i 'll tell him ?
that was it . yeah , that was it .
good pasta , good wine .
yeah . not only can i drive , i ..
why would he do that ?
he 's obsessed with the house ,
i tried . i tried , man , but she just won 't buy it .
i need you to get brian in it to discreetly
if there 's anything to find on charlie peck ,
charlie , you scared the shit out of me .
i am so sorry .
i thought you might be hungry .
he 's okay .
when i heard he was in the hospital ,
and lonely , so ...
you just pick off what you don 't like .
he 's not the upstanding citizen
no , but i 'm starving , so this is perfect .
make sure she 's all right , call me back .
well , that 's like me .
all i have to do
all right . where am i gonna put you ?
i haven 't seen it around here
look , i know about you .
so .... .
annie .

he was bringing you flowers .
did he come by here last night ?
i think he 's the one that tried to run me off the road .
yes .
what time did mike leave last night ?
how did he know ? how did he know i wasn 't here ?
this ... this guy is dangerous . okay ?
okay . okay , babe , i believe you . i do .
just call the police , okay ?
i 'm a professional dancer .
there has to be something else .
we 'll make it through this .
wilson , fill me in .
i 'll be with you in two shakes of a lamb 's tail , dr. torres .
primary survey revealed a large , briskly bleeding scalp lac .
do you need to take that ?
i 'm sorry .
you know what ? i liked you a lot better
am i qualified to run the department ?
what i do know is that for some strange reason ,
so , you did your fellowship
oh , such a great guy . really , sweet as pie .
i took it as a compliment , but still , awkward .
who 's there ?
just put on a lead apron !
kepner . dr. kepner , put on the damn apron !
um .. wilson , take over for dr. kepner .
i 'm sorry . i
i 'm telling you , kid , this is the place to be .
the company 's great .
my intestines are on the inside , but still ,
in fact ...
staples alone should do it .
i mean , i would , but , you know , i don 't like leaks , so ...
oh , i know . i taught you how to do your first s.t.e.p. procedure ,
because it 's freaking rude , alex ,
.. but what you do reflects on me ,
don 't act like you haven 't decided .
i promise , i 'll let you know as soon as i 've made a decision .
foundation 's absorbing pac-north and its employees .
in that event , uh , i 'd like to make some recommendations .
but i had to bring you in here to , uh , kill some time
well , thank you so much .
she was gracious enough
i hate to brag ,
little to no power has really gone to your head .
she 's like the putin of pastry .
i haven 't slipped on one used baby diaper all day .
that 's , like , the third time
i know . it 's like where 's waldo ?
not seeing a hostess up in here .
if marty scorsese walks in here ,
who is this , and where can i get one ?
oh , it 's lovely to meet you .
i really want nashit to work out .
well , i guess that 's good news for me .
i love him . he 's my favorite .
hmm , so you think you 're pretty .
okay , nashit , pay attention
max , be professional .
please , i have to make him a waiter .
max . i don 't know what i 'm gonna do .
this is desperate .
hey . i have a question for you .
you must have a little irish in you .
aren 't you too old for him ?
ashvsash.cwell , i 'm off to chinatown to have someone put needles in me .
you look gorgeous .
okay , so i can see you 're a kiss-ass ,
there are no hookups here at the high .
the high is about fine pastry ,
consider her hot ass out the door .
she got drunk , stole my black card ,
oh , i was planning more . i just ran out of paper .
i have two $ 100 bills , and i 'm this close
you have been driven mad with power .
and speaking of flakes ,
how-did-she get in here ?
it 's go time , as in she 's got to go .
oh , my god , he even looks good here in morgue light .
caroline , you left your phone on the table at the restaurant .

i have an iphone sick .
i mean , you like nora jones .

i 'm not letting you out while you 're still in heat.ashvsash.com
what on earth makes you think that young man 's prepared
and he 's my student . i do , too .
now he 's my boss ,
you are forgetting who you 're dating , richard .
i have made an extremely savvy investment .
i 've placed at the top of the organization
this is not it .
will be combined to save on personnel ?
i was running on time ,
and the trauma department .
um , i 'm not ready for that just yet .
uh , it 's just that
it could be a month before a decision .
they know that 's the idea , yeah .
i think we should table this until we can bring in owen .
you know , i don 't care
and we appreciate that .
yeah , well , no one asked you
if we put kepner 's donor to o.r. 1 ,
okay . 6 .
i thought you said you were getting them back .
chief .
they got a kidney that 's a match for jaelynn donovan .
no o.r. staff . half the nurses have quit ,
this girl 's 16 .
okay . all right .
uh , just a second .
ruth , excuse us , please .
avery .
i just didn 't want you to hear a rumor
i 'm gonna talk to catherine avery .
dr. yang here .
he actually used the word " hematochezia . "
he did a residency with a.l.s. ?
he 's an amazing guy .
hey , could you turn that down ?
this is a hospital . there are very sick people here .
okay , everyone out .
it 's all right .
well , dr. edwards and i need to discuss your next steps .
i 've been shut out of every decision
all right . calm down .
guys , guys , guys . let 's take this somewhere else .
you 're all just talking about a new chief ?
it was brought up , and we tabled it .
you shouldn 't even be talking about it .
why do we need an emergency meeting ?
what ?
oh , don 't make this my fault .
that he might be getting fired ? of course i did .
avery has his own agenda .
we went behind his back long enough .
well , then count me out .
oh , well , karev 's kid just got a kidney from u.n.o.s .
now you 're just making up words .
or you 'll lose the kidney .
she won 't .
okay , the meds , uh , they can cause
if you were dying , would you donate your organs ?
even if you still had time ?
i 've got a real heart for you .
move on .
it 's like it was yesterday .
you can 't forgive him . so don 't .
take his perfectly good heart and outlive him with it .
there 's enough juice to get you dancing on his grave .
and ...
the other one is going to a 44-year-old councilman in nevada .
you get it now .
keep going .
and a 10-year-old in oregon will get to play
the place doesn 't run without owen , derek .
i didn 't force him to leave .
where are you going ?
no , i 'm in 2 .
move . i 've got a domino transplant .
i can totally wait .
well , i can 't . let 's get this show on the road .
this o.r. ' s the only one that 's staffed .
my patient is trying to die in here ,
maybe you should go first .
shut up !
all right , here 's what you 're gonna do ...
kepner , go back to your patient .
yang , you 're in o.r. 2 .
heart and lungs trump kidneys .
you can 't
he 's the boss . now move .
you mean " thank you , meredith
you want me to apologize , alex ?
i 'm sorry we bought the hospital .
but we didn 't do it for just us .
we tell them that it 's wrong to blame others ...
or try to cover it up .
hey , carlos ! you got a minute ?
be right there .
not much , apparently .
have you lost what 's left of your mind ?
oh , i know you bought it .
no way . it is not $ 100,000 .
i know ! what are we gonna do with it :
oh , my gosh ! oh , my gosh !
obviously , we should put some in the kids ' college fund ,
definitely . we should do all of that ..
that doesn 't also sell patio furniture and meat .
'll bet $ 20 .
you didn 't even look at your cards .
so what do you sayvan de kamp ?
huh . let 's see what you are made of .
oh , look at me ! i should buy a lottery ticket right now .
i knew you 'd be upset to find you 'd bought me a house .
i guess
you 're giving them back ?
i think we should scatter them together .
there 's a pretty little lake about an hour north of here .
i think she 'd be happy there .
why do you want me there ?
it 's what i think she 'd want .
shall we say tomorrow around 10 : 00 ?
shall i make us some sandwiches ?
dick , are you awake ?
you were rig about the lucky streak .
actually , l brought something .
oh , great . we 've got tension and firearms . let 's add alcohol .
andrew 's only been sober a month .
and the whole time , you were just covering your ass !
people ?
that 's not important .
nothing . it was a moth .
her i can understand , but my own wife ?
not to me . i mean , not a day went by
i was taking him to ball games ,
i know . what a wife , huh ?
i 'm supposed to sit down with my team the moment i land .
i understand . you have been working so hard .
what 's so funny ?
i think she 'd be glad .
she couldn 't please either of us without hurting the other ,
what ?
i don 't know . i wasn 't there when she died .
those are $ 1,000 chips . i 'm all in .
she 's nuts . we 're taking these back .
grandpa must know something . i 'll call .
susan , what 's wrong ?
your friend is gonna be thrilled . you just won for him .
he wanted me to come here .
and he was right . i am .
why ?
and why did i get a kidney while good people died ?
i served in korea with this guy , joe dansak
he was dead ?
that night asked the sergeant ,
i 'm trying to do anything i canto get you to stop crying , honey .
who knows why ? just enjoy it .
that just scattering some ashes is gonna make me trust you ?
it 's why you brought a gun .
you 're not gonna deny it .
i know ... and i 'd be crazy to let you keep it .
how did you get that ?
but i did pick up a few skills .
so now i 'm supposed to believe you ?
how do you trust somebody who doesn 't trust you ?
well , just keep looking . it 's not that big a forest .
the roads were closed . we we trapped in the woods .
look , lee , i 'm sorry , okay ?
they 're not anymore .
don 't try to play me . carlos called this morning .
yeah . he asked if i could watch the girls
no . not really , ben .
yeah , she 's terrified !
great . you know , this is just great .
no , she is not .
but maybe they should come in and we should test their blood , too .
alarms ? who cares about alarms ?
look , ben , it doesn 't transmit that easily . okay ?
okay . all right , all right , all right ...
prob .... . do you want to start a panic ?
you know , publicly embarrassing the army doesn 't usually end that well .
yeah , how can you be 100 % sure ?
i mean , no protocols ?
it 's never been at our back door before .
fear .
really ?
i mean going in for the first time .
makes you think there 's an order to the world .
we 'll just get a thermometer .
why not ?
we used ' em on the monkeys .
if you 're not already a member ,
sir , you need to get out of the vicinity .
you need to get out of here .
travis rhodes , cdc . i 'll be taking it from here .
and the army doesn 't have jurisdiction over a private facility .
i just want you to know we 've been cooperating fully with the army .
this isn 't a pissing contest .
i don 't know what the problem is , there 's only one right thing to do here .
on you .
you need to warn the hospital .
but let 's look at the facts .
god , it really adds up , doesn 't it ?
oh , but i did meet your roommate a few times .
linda . linda , right . and her boyfriend , what was his name ?
i haven 't seen them in a while . are they all right ?
i forget .
watch out for my hand .
i can 't believe you 're breaking up with me now .
we didn 't get back together .
takes longer than it should to figure that part .
even strangers .
then we won 't be strangers anymore .
well , sure . let 's see . i was born in ..
and his dad was born in okie . used to catch bass .
doctors give me six months to live .
if you ask me , a man is not supposed to know when his time is up ,
but that ain 't no way into heaven .
hmm ?
i 'm gonna go drain the snake .
no , thanks , i 'm good .
i think he 's soulful .
glen ? what ? he told us his life story .
you almost had me fooled with that line
don 't be sorry , son .
what ?
shoot you ? i don 't .. are we still speaking metaphorically ?
okay , you know what ? she 's gonna be back any second .
i specifically requested a male !
okay , you know what ? i don 't think i am who you think i am .
because i was afraid i could fight you off !
dodge ? glen ?
glen 's dead .
oh , come on . he can 't be serious .
who gives a shit ?
i think we can take him .
what are you doing ? what are you doing ?
don 't you think that he must have better things to do ?
jesus , what 's he gonna do , shoot us ?
aii right ! aii right ! let 's pull it over .
but i should warn you , my dad 's ex-military
and he 's currently not surprised .
how come you 're not with your family ?
what do you mean ?
my wife recently ran away , as fast as any human woman could .
which is ironic , because
my wife was my roommate .
even after she got sick , she always made the most sense .
she may be a romantic on the outside ,
can we restart civilization without her ?
but she deserves to be one of the top quality females in contention .
that 's okay .
wow . and i can make something with this .
yeah , we used to break into people 's houses when we were kids ,
we 'd just eat their ice cream and watch cable .
um , penny ?
couple of hours . think you needed it .
can you grab the wine ?
okay , so explain this to me . mmm-hmm .
you went out and harvested the wheat .
that was actually good .
mmm . perfect .
look at that little face .
highlights .
i think you could say that i dabbled .
i watched everything my mum did and did the exact opposite .
you 've never seen two people more in love .
i mean , they 're not for everyone , you know ?
it 's very delicate , it can get wrecked so easily .
do you hear how full it sounds ?
the grooves in them are sort of deeper and wider .
i mean , they 're harder to carry around ' cause they 're heavier ,
it 's an amazing turntable . it 's vintage , cherry wood victor 45 .
i can 't wait to hear it again .
i 'm going to ..
i 'm gonna sit in my dad 's garden .
hi , frank .
is it a bad time ?
thank you .
i can 't believe it . you 're here ,
penny , this is frank . hi .
oh ! oh , it 's lovely to meet you .
welcome . well , you must be hungry or something .
sure . uh , go right in there . go ahead .
yeah , right at the top of the stairs . here .
matilda will be arriving one week ahead of schedule .
also , a friendly reminder
on a personal note , this is my final broadcast .
on behalf of myself , producer bruce hammond ,
tonight , i 'll be sitting across the dinner table from my wife , helen ,
he was going to kick me out . i had to do something .
we always knew
i allowed my own daughter to be defiled by that man .
you can invite me over for turkey
oh . wonderful .
is it okay if she comes , too ?
as a guest .
she 's okay with me and m.j. coming ?
yeah . medium rare .
that happens .
and then i can put her down .
i 'm thinking it 's about time we sleep-trained her .
yeah , yeah . here . you put ' em in their crib ,
i just never really got the point of it .
the first night she cries for 20 minutes ,

cam , this is so you , okay ?
i mean , there 's nothing wrong with accepting the fact
you don 't want to look up one day and think ,
i had to get the range back

leonard , did you really just text me from the couch
i swear to god , i will throw this out .
oh , wait , it was just your mom .
yeah . we 've been talking a lot lately .
no , i think she 's lonely .
okay , just be careful .
no , it 's not like that .
and you don 't seem to care if you live or die .
that makes things a little trickier ,
oh , hello , leonard .
fine . and you ?
well , it 's been lovely catching up .
oh , brother .
and a " rack star . " ohh .
oh , yeah . " he 's denim-ite . "

excuse me . i 'm terribly sorry . excuse me .
how about i 'll just leave money , i take it ?
not if you just did it for me .
excuse me . excuse me .
oh , why didn 't you say something ?
you think you can intimidate me with that attitude ?
we don 't need these people .
come on . we 'll get a better cake .
i 've got it covered . excuse me , miss ?
i know how delicate they can be .
yeah , take care now .

kids make fun of you if you get a haircut .
everybody 's so excited to celebrate with you .
the baby was ready , but i was not .
i couldn 't let him share a birthday , too .
i thought you wanted me to come out .
we stole you a beautiful birthday cake .
yes , you fix it .
what do you want ? !
she is coming back . i am almost positive .
why do i listen to you ? why ?
you were wrong about tomato being a vegetable .
and unless she was lying to the good ladies of " the view , "
dr. cooper ,
not at all .
look , i-it doesn 't matter if they have popular support ,
that 's great , scooby gang .
uh , that 's a great idea .

hey . kids asleep ?
apparently , halley 's afraid of the dark now
jot that down , we can ask him as soon as he learns to speak .
i 'll go talk to her .
honey , remember , she 's my child , too .
i know someone else who was afraid of the dark once .
and just like you , i was wearing a full diaper .
they 're inviting several nobel laureates to our reception .
makoto kobayashi .
that looks just like you .
and the best part is ,
absolutely not .
because i don 't want the whole world to know
sheldon , please don 't take this the wrong way ,
but just for fun , why do you ?
what ?
.. you got someone who 's okay .
you should understand that more than anyone .
you know my work ?
leonard ?
uh , science has a history of difficult people .
yeah , you know , and i don 't need to tell you
the way they dealt with adversity .
but since my death , my friends had lost their interest in fiction .
their own problems had become absorbing enough .
i don 't know . everything in the north quadrant of yours is clothes and books .
mom , this isn 't gonna work . i 'm not giving up my car .
you can 't stop us from going inside the house .
i could give you the new keys if you 'd adhere to my rules ,
i 'm outta here .

good night . good night .
if it feels hot , do not open it .
if the door is not hot , you may leave the room ,
al those " ach 's . "
i love to listen to brazilian singers .
it 's kind of weird
i learned that word in your book .
anomaly . i like the way it sounds
before i used to know there was a word for it ,
i mean , not a lot , but sometimes .
you know what i mean ?
they 're scrambled perfectly . do you want to try some ?
yes ?
what do you mean ?
really ?
i mean , yeah . i mean , it 's awfully sudden .
do we need to decide now ?
no , maybe i should go and see her , right ?
i think that 's such an important
could you not do that ?
these are the important questions
well , they can tell if you 're smiling
try it as an experiment on the phone with a friend .
watch .
and i have no one to talk to .
i 'm sorry . i don 't mean to burden you with that .
i have no one to talk to .
think of the customer as a friend .
is it the zoloft , dr. horowitz ?
and your products or services .
i think there 's something very , very wrong with me .
yes , what does it cost you ?
focus on that during your conversation .
death comes , that 's it .
remember there is someone out there for everyone .
remember every person you speak to needs love .
it 's stupid , it 's stupid , and the face is broken .
nah , i don 't get it . i don 't get it .
i don 't know . it 's in japanese .
welcome home , honey . it 's a surprise party .
michael , it 's great to see you .
who are they ? it 's everybody , honey .
i got you this to give to me .
that 's more of a prom thing .
my mom paid my cousin to take me ,
mommy needs a foot rub !
i 'm really not much of a dancer .
the bride and groom seem happy .
they have a feverish night of
that sounds like a late night ,
no , it 's not . i 'm not going in there .
she 's just sitting in there reading a magazine .
i go in all the time .
and again , you 're welcome .
no , thanks . i 'm gonna head home .
good night .
great . until i accidentally made leonard fall in love with me .
do you want a glass of wine ?
you know what i 'm talking about .
how about giant rabbits ?
they always look like they 're about to say something ,
and on a side note , they are one of the few mammals
i honestly don 't care .
because every time we 've talked about unusual animal genitals ,
would that be a giant rat 's ass ?
can we please talk about something else ?
okay , how about this for a topic :
what does that tell you ?
you ready to bowl ?
i don 't know if stuart told you what you 're up against tonight ,
by studying the comic strip cathy .
ack !
did leonard send you over here ?
ashvsash.com caused us to forfeit to stuart and his dastardly ringer wil wheaton .
i 'm not too proud to admit that i cried myself to sleep .
the part where i tell you i 've engineered a rematch
things are a little weird with leonard right now .
i 'm the captain . i can do that .
you 're n gonna leave me alone until i do it , are you ?
i think we should talk now .
we don 't have to talk ' cause there 's nothing to talk about .
really ?
as my mother would say .
oh , yeah , me , too .
tell me about it .
see ?
still so hard to see it like this .
yeah , nature can be a real bitch .
just wondering who still lives there .
no , not all of them .
you 're hurt . i ain 't leaving .
we got to get out of the ninth .
i 'm not gonna make it over this gate .
i need you to trust me .
what , you think you better than me ?
what you even doing here ?
don 't act like you know me .
you don 't know the shit i 've been through since you left .
why , alicia ? because you care ?
you bailed !
we were 17 , and i was terrified out there without you .
why ?
he 's been sad and ... and angry .
well , it sounds like he may be grieving .
of course . you can grieve over any emotional loss .
oh , boy . he cared about this a lot .
well , grieving is a process .
you didn 't raise me at all .
i 'm not scared . i don 't like the act .
why didn 't you say something earlier ?
hey , this isn 't about me .
well , that 's honest .
i respect that ,
why are you watching that ?
it 's not important . i remember everything i said .
the house is so quiet when it 's empty , you know ?
but anyway , okay . so i 'll see you guys tonight .
i have no idea what just happened .
like at a girl bar ?
no , no , not a " ladies night " ladies night .
okay , so do we have another lady .
bailey .
what ?
damn it . i had one of those last year .
no ! would it be ,
i mean , i scrubbed in on one of those ,
and if it 's proximal , i would do a partial ablation
but i do , because the torres method is in me .
you get to study with torres
and the rest of us are working the free clinic at the mall .
the boards are around the corner ,
yang is fine .
it is an artificial environment ,
the point is , i wanna know .
it 's a little unconventional to operate on a donor ,
great idea ? you want to put
i don 't agree .
dr. bailey ... are you arguing
tell them this donor 's unsuitable .
we 've put you back on the transplant list .
cut the crap , dr. webber .
that thing 's really taken root !
yankos los pee-pee .
usually , doctors like to do this sort of thing
0n three . three !
comedy is all about timing , har .
oh , definitely . but not as !
crap on toast . pretty bird .
come on , siskel , give me a movie quote .
relax . it 's just a little candy .

i need a kidney transplant .
so what do you wanna do for dinner tonight ?
i could eat the mud-hole out of a dead skunk !
getting a new kidney is a really big deal .
yeah , well ,
wait . don 't panic .
i don 't know about this , lloyd . i haven 't been home in over 20 years .

harry , before you go , your mail piling up for many year .
huh . junk mail , junk mail .
oh , look at this .
do you know what this means , harry ?
with grown kidneys .
even if i find him , my kid 's never met me .
are you serious ?
1it 's the least he can do .
you gave him his space . kids love that .
and you filled him with wonder .
like , " i wonder who my deadbeat dad is ? "
i fathered a child
okay , okay . so how are we gonna do this ?
if we find your kid , we find your kidney .
yeah , but i never even knew where fraida lived .
didn 't you meet her through pete stainer ?
the word is pronounced " subtle , " harry . it 's a silent " b. "
maybe we should catch a bus to pee-stain 's house .
oh , that 's okay . they got bike racks on the front of buses now .
perfect .
hey , guys !
oh , it 's not ours .
yeah . just left it there double-chained to a tree .
the second most annoying sound in the world ? sure .
no , not that .
the motorcycle accident ?
the obituary said he was survived by his parents .
are you sure ?
oh , yeah .
anyway . sorry about that whole thing
you 're the one who sold him the motorcycle .
my bike for his helmet , straight up .
she worked at the funeral parlor where they buried pee-stain .
if i hadn 't sold that crotch rocket to pee-stain ,
yeah . i bet he smokes weed
what are you doing , lloyd ?
sorry , har .
excuse me , sir . is fraida working today ?
what do you mean , " what do we do now ? "
i need something to drink .
we tried ard we failed
what if ... darn it , har !
why didn 't you just go find her in person ?
maybe she didn 't get your letter .
what if we go track her down for you ? there 's no lawsuit against that .
you 'd help me out ?
i 'll lend you a car .
yeah , using this address and our superior instincts ,
wait . where did you get that ?
i 'm about to meet my kid and i don 't know what to say to her .
you make a little small talk about why you missed
and boing , you hit her up for the kidney .
she 's not gonna say no . she 's the fruit of your loom .
you 're the spitting image of your mother .
i want your nuts , harry !
vhatever .
think of the bright side . you 're finally getting to meet her
i totally sucked you in .
i wonder what it would have been like to raise a child .
you don 't need training wheels . you can do this .

i 'm way too flu-ey to travel .
they were finally gonna get to meet you in person !
ms. pinchelow , your car is here .

for he knew they were still full of life .
uh , i 'm just gonna say it .
best toast ever , wind
it 's worse than we thought .
get on the horn to the lodge .
they 're gonna have to evacuate .
blade insists
i 'm not gonna evacuate now just to be " safe . "
where 's blade ?
where do you think he is ?
if we 're gonna save the lodge ,
and make it a split load
nobody has your gearbox .
hey ! you copy that ?
yeah . yes . copy that .

you just wasted all of it .
i said , " split load . "
this is what you trained me to do !

oh ! ah !
you know what ? i 'll find my way out .
i didn 't want to push my engine .
blade , listen to me .
come on , spinner ! let 's see that plaque .

and now is the moment i 've been waiting for !
let 's get out of here .
don 't panic ! we must evacuate !
keep moving
all right . look , there 's no need to panic .
if you all just calm down , you can come back next year .
i 'll see you right here !
and remember , avoid the smoke , stay above the canyon walls ,
move along . quickly , please .
the train is fu .
they will lead you to the main road exit .
that ain 't blade 's style .
hick ?
it was just a routine day on the set .
blade was the first one on the scene
and blade thought his life was over , too .
he got trained , got certified , and came here .
i know it 's after sunset , but you 're in command
if you 're gonna go , you better go now .

hey , luke . how 's it going ? i
oh , okay , well , i just wanted to drop off this bag of junk food .
uh , cam and i are on a juice fast ,
seeing that weird , wonderful little man
of walking on a tightrope .

hon , i realize that this situation is not ideal
uh , no , i did not .
okay , well , i was just dropping off my kids .
well , we were chatting .
okay . you betcha .

bye-bye !
oh ! now i think of it !
cam , on the other hand , has gone all ..
i just wish my sister would put herself out there more .
why are men so superficial ?
are we gonna have any more trouble ?
oh , claire , do you need me to drive the girls ?
goat cheese risotto ball ?
are you sure ? they 're so good .
it 's tough enough to deal with cam when i 'm at full strength .
cam ! don 't be mad at me ,
you 're supposed to be my support .
but he 's doing this weird twisting thing in the water .
so i paddle over , and i see he 's got a plastic grocery bag ,
it didn 't work , so i-i jumped in ,
and i never saw him again .
of course i 'm not okay .
okay , well , you need to pull yourself together .
he drowned , cam !
yeah , yeah , i just think he needs a little air .
mitchell , get back here !
mitchell , what is wrong with you ? !
well , if you 're starving , then just eat something !
i 'm not gonna get mad at you !
i 'm doing it for you .
forget my whisk ! it 's over !
thanks , caroline !
can 't you just go to deke 's without me ?
then what better place to be than in a dumpster ?
and relax , it 's not a three-way situation .
well , at least i 'm with taylor .
okay , yes , it was fun .
pastry school , no pastry school , eh , no big deal .
what ?
yes , i love that frickin ' place !

or ceelo .
they were way up here .
your father isn 't martin channing ,
it 's almost a chicken-y fish .
what , that the fish was chicken-y ?
why would i tell you ?
deke does have a point .
ah , speaking of serving , there are like nine forks here .
it 's easy for you to say , deke . you didn 't lose money .
the fourth floor , deke !
genet , i cannot believe you would invite
max , these are our friends .
and i 'm not gonna sit here and let them insult her .
well , she sleeps in the wall .
max , take it down .
for your money or their approval .
no , this is my fault . i 'll go .
deacon , sit down .
i go where she goes .
i mean , what is the big deal , anyway ?
what ? you were a stripper ?
max !
i feel so bad .
marrying a black stripper is awesome .
but you 're okay with outing my mom ?
it only took me two hours to decide , and i picked you .
you didn 't even think it over .
deke , how are you gonna live without money ?
i 'm used to roughing it .
they did .
there 's a lot of interest in that band .
fucking oasis rock up ,
real people don 't care about indie bands .
they buy four albums a year and
yeah
darren , what is the meaning of life ?
make records you 're proud of .
morning
i 'll see you in business affairs .
meetings .
fat boy here you already know .
given that our md 's idea of fun is
is that a yes , then ?
i mean , it 'll cost us something like a hundred
signing records can literally cost you your fucking job .
maybe .
88.9 % share of the singles market .
rage .
i ain 't dismantling the studio to start some fucking rehearsals .
look , do you believe in this 9uy long term ?
of course .
fair enough .
so , how 's the record sounding ?
we 'll have a playback soon . it 's fucking out there , man .
experimental ?
listen , david , we did well with the debut , over 100,000 .
if you make a really uncompromising original record ,
schneider 's face .
derek wants to see you .
in the land of the blind , rebecca ..
make sure they send someone
the fucking what ?
how amusing .
thought you might like to hear from the
maybe if it was bigger at club , we 'd have more ammunition .
it just seems to be the kind of track that needs
are you telling me we 've paid a hundred grand
it 's got me in the eye .
the radio department hate the record .
it 's no reflection on you , steven .
you know , i don 't want it
well , congratulations . well done , mate .
thanks .
it 's in the fridge .
i mean , let 's be honest , david was all over the place .
have you guys heard about roger ?
he hasn 't been in for three fucking days now .
someone beat him to death ... in his flac .
the point is , steven , we 're dead in the water .
you 're off to austin for south by southwest this week , right ?
we 're gonna see a lot of new bands .
it 's a policeman .
is that for the rage album ?
wow . my wife bought that .

yeah , saturday . wouldn 't miss it .
sorry . i 'm really tired .
are you like hitting on me ?
what ?
will you give me a sec ?
strap yourselves in , lads .
he just rocks up , box of microphones , records the band live .
the way i see it , we 've got enough buzz in the band .
he isn 't really asking our opinions on anything
ero .
everyone here has their own specialties ,
steven , i hear you 're taking a look at
apparently quite a few people are interested .
do i wanna sign them ?
signing bands can literally cost you your fucking job .
he might be privately convinced that
it 's win-win for him .
if they 2o down like the titanic
on the other hand , if i don 't sign them and ,
i 'm the guy who laid a giant shit on the beatles ' demo
they 're meant to be good .
it 's out of town a bit , i think , in brooklyn .
all the top brass from the american label .
champagne , sir . thank you .
thanks .
just do us a favour and fucking behave yourself , yeah ?
and for the first time i begin to wonder ,
i 've got a problem with this video shoot .
hi . it 's rebecca . one other thing
you killed roger , didn 't you ?
here 's a tin .
these people keep records , you know .
advancement , steven . same as you .
can you tell me why one of your neighbours claims
i ... i got up early to go and get a paper .
where did you buy this newspaper ?
alan , is everything all right ?
call him back . call me .
it 's fucking bad .
the tumbling zeroes .
are you gonna let me in ?
jesus fucking christ .
you 've gone awol .
look , we haven 't been working together long ...
we 're not working together .
right ?
then ... then , please , get off your nut at dinner ,
the label needs someone like you , because you 're sharp .
but you have got lost .
you throw enough shit at the wall , then something 'll stick ,
congratulations , steven .
result , mate . well done .
so that 's why he didn 't fire me .
he knew the track had landed .
failure is a lonely rapist hiding in the bushes .
everyone is going to fucking pay .
if i was just writing songs all the time
two ?
fancy making some drinks , alan ?
yeah , ok
he 's a married copper with kids .
i 'm gonna enjoy us working together .
you 're either outside or you 're inside .
i can 't fucking take it .
a couple more days ?
someone 's gonna do me .
i know this is not great timing
you know , let the dust settle .
i had nothing to do with that stuff they found , right ?
here . i brought you some magazines .
hey , it 's the least i could do , mate .
power comes from the relentless pursuit of the unattainable .
listen to this
the drum and bass stephen hawking ,
oh , i hope it 's not a west coast party ,
oh , don 't be . you get your hopes up ,
that 's an actual kick .
i felt a kick .
oh , yeah , that 's where i put it .
i just ...
which mit did you go to ?
we don 't have a crib , we don 't have diapers .
anyone can just walk in off the street and lift our toilet lids !
do we ?
it 's like we 're living in the future !
imagine this : you 've got the baby in one hand ,
here . give me those .
it 's weird that guy thought you were a couple .
easy .
you know , we 'll get the crib out
oh , is it your back ?
anyway , let 's just get in and see if the gps

my sister 's husband took all her things , too .

you are the practice round .
uh , no . he-he just means that
we 've never thrown a brunch before ,
you see , your words sound reasonable ,
stuart , you know you 're one of our favorite people .
i 'm glad we did this test run .
max , in my country , i 'm average height .
so who wants to go in the back
right , we 're not supposed to get all excited about this opening tonight .
ha ! that 's like saying the people
oleg , what are you still doing with the arrow from our shop ?
no , i said i was hung .
there are people in front of our window ?
yeah , right over there .
i caught this at his last concert .
so , like , what , dude ? he just dropped to the ground ?
he smiled ? dude .
sorry for your loss . and dope hat .
max , what are you doing ?
we need to distance ourselves from the entire event .
dude , can i get three dozen cupcakes ?
i have beaucoup friends coming here for the midnight vigil .
whatever that means .
he 's cashing in on a man 's death .
and in his honor , tonight we are serving
looks like jiminy cricket turned to the dark side .
nope . no way , max . this is our shrine .
we 're moving the dead guy shrine back ?
it died here too .
because if you do , grab one of these poems
i think maybe you 're being a little harsh .
oops , knocked over a candle .
fire on my shoe .
look , look .

i 'll see you in the o.r. in about eight minutes . hustle .
oh , i 'm sorry .

it 's irrelevant .
that is not the point !
they think that she 's rejecting her heart .
you just have to get back here .
what do you mean you can 't find frankie ?
what ?
well , she usually hides somewhere over here .
bam ! gotcha , frankie !
wake up . frankie , wake up !
left , left , left . hold it .
right . right , right .
you don 't accept who i am or what i believe .
you judge my faith because you don 't have any .
i have faith in medicine . i have faith in helping people .
faith is believing in what you can 't see .
you think what i believe is ridiculous .
your god is like our hypothetical deaf child , april .
great . let 's get started .
i 've got a stack of intern applications on my desk
okay .
all right , get her on her side .
oh , my god .
so , let me get this straight .
now the symptoms are back and worse .
i was going to say your prelim neuro looks good .
and then today ,
i think i 'm gonna kill this girl .
i think if there were

who are you ? pierre berge .
as for the events in algeria ,
a combat ? as you pose for pictures ?
he was your age !
" yves saint laurent hesitates about taking arms .
you already got me a deferment .
a few days later you responded to your enlistment orders .
empty your pockets .
this isn 't a prison .
i called you .
mr. mathieu-saint-laurent is manic-depressive .
his friend
hello , pierre
your mother is nearby at the hotel frontenac .
do you want to live or die ?
boussac took advantage of your breakdown
we 'll fight !
i want to draw , to create in total freedom .
with my dresses , with my sketches ,
mr. berge .
it 's complicated at the moment
what 's this about ?
boussac behaved miserably . i want him to pay .
700,000 francs in damages .
exactly .
he suspects nothing . it 's his weakness .
so listen to them . don 't get all high and mighty .
let 's do that .
it was harmless . we were just hanging out .
it 's not that big a deal .
very funny .
it never happened to you ?
i forgot . you 're a real man .
you 're so vulgar , poor thing . it 's terrifying

the world was changing
i refused , of course .
your mondrian collection was pure genius .
the owner of charles of the ritzbought
betty , please !
i refuse to lock myself
it reaches a much larger group of people .
who designed the 300 outfits in the collection ?
you , i imagine .
i 'd like to go away .
then come back to see .
i 'm alone .
will you do my 4 collections a year ?
i made the noose and you 're putting it around my neck .
you have it all and you 're a lush . what do you want ?
in marrakech , you discovered sunlight ,
a little insect that goes round and round the world
taste
what is this ? a secret meeting ?
i 'd say ... the spring .
1t 's over . it 's tune .
the " liberation " collection sparked a scandal
you developed a taste for insolence .
i can 't control myself .
you listen to no one .
what do you want me to do ?
all great things we know
the world will never know what it owes them
someone for mr. saint jaurent .
first time i saw " tarzan , " i wanted to live outside .
taught me how to open a can with a bird 's beak .
i 'm doing it .
of course not .
no eggs for me . i 'll be having porridge .
okay , go . go , go , go !

well , they are a little bit set in their ways .
input !
oh , i was just , like , trying to get signal .

why is it on the hallway table ?
why aren 't our feet at the end of our arms ?

glowing letters appear on the chest that read ,
oh , boy , happy place , happy place .
you 're ten seconds away from getting crushed !
what are we supposed to do ?
wait , wait .
come on , sheldon .
just admit it .
oh , don 't be silly .
why is this so important to you ?
what was so bad about them ?
instead of leaving santa milk and cookies ,
i think you feel asleep with the tv on .
anything but french toast .
i got it .
are you serious ?
fine .
oh , my god . this is so romantic .
oh , my god ! this is so romantic .

hmm .
what 's , uh , wellenbeck ?

isn 't so simple .
i really think you should pay rent .
you have to mean it .
i told you you can 't give me money .
i 'm your friend , your equal , so .
cause i was just doing the " poor but proud thing for show
of course when you become a doctor , " sorry " is not a happy word .
ooh. that is better .
how many days ?
i 'll need to wait a few weeks until the swelling goes down to repair that .
those corporate bastards , the same ones who just bulldozed me out of kaili
there is so much about that sentence i do not understand .
uh , uh . kaili .
you named a tree " kaili " ?
she was all of those things , and now she 's gone .
and for what , yuppie housing ?
i 'm really sorry
i mean , how exactly does one say. eliminate waste ?
tree friend .
oh , excuse me , young-and-yummy doctor .
are you looking for someone , ma 'am ?
okay . i 'm gonna go back to work now but good luck with , whatever .
gosh , i guess she 's a patient now .
i 'm an old friend .
oh , a doctor and a gentleman . now that 's a double yummy .
oh , my god. mom .
mom ?
uh , i 'm covering the pit , chief , and
i got it , meredith .
hey. what are you doing here ?
i 'm on hunt 's service all month .
could be through and through put a swab through and see where it goes
does it enter and exit :
there 's blood in the urine so i m guessing kidney .
yang page shepherd .
maddy how 's this feel ?
good . now what about this cut ?
she 's scared .
we called social services and they 'll be here soon .
that 's how she got the cut .
he put the gun down for a minute .
she never meant to hurt him .
everything will be okay .
i don 't deserve your forgiveness
good luck .
she had a spot of cancer last year . it was breast cancer
i 'm gonna need the angular vascular clamp .
don 't move . yang .
this is not about richard
and i have tried to draw a line , and he won 't respect it .
i need you to be on my side .
because i swear , derek , if he is there , i won 't be
okay .
they tried to kill me ,
you are an adult woman
how long have you all been together ?
it 's not just a mole .
now you don 't have skin on your organs , hon .
what i have is nothing like what grammy has .
okay. i 'm sorry. i 'm sorry
it 's okay. i 'm okay
i think those mets are shrunk way down ,
this scan has to be good . it has to be good .
so .. bucket .
she 's , uh , up in a tree right
yeah .
we drape the patients so we don 't see their faces .
and i 'll keep loving that ,
open the bag . see the bottle with the blue label ?
what is this stuff ?
when , uh , you don 't have time to stitch a guy up ,
b.p. is going up. he 's stabilizing .
it 's , uh , mets , mom. mets .
yeah , like baseball .
the cancer 's practically gone .
looks like we caught it early after all .
oh , my baby
thank you ! thank you ! thank you ! thank you .
you know , you weren 't gonna give me chief
you sent her out to the woods to bring me back .
you paged her to your office to try on dresses
you keep saving that youre not her father .
for what it 's worth ...
hunt is incredible .
he has one lung. he 's got one kidney left .
dr. grey. meredith , don 't .
helm , get the ultrasound .
all was fine and good until they hit cruising altitude .
it 's colder than everest , and there 's less o2 .
and when the landing gear opens ,
hughes . hello . what do we got ?
also , he bribed the family with a pro bono surgery .
and yet totally on brand .
uh , losing her job and possibly losing her license ?
she can just ... do the right thing .
that wasn 't a dare .
wait . no . i don 't really think that she 's lucky !
you have no idea .
no judgment here .
um , yeah ... helm , sure .
and that she 's still my mentor ,
all right , clamping the aorta .
that 's. weird .
how is she ? finally got her boyfriend calmed down .
she cannot catch a break .
all right , well , we 're gonna have to do a bypass ,
i 'm sure this is a bad time .
i 'm having a red-letter day .
i would like to explain how this happened .
i only pitched them a few ideas .
that , i never even said .
anything that i actually wrote
i tried . they won 't .
a retraction won 't help , grey .
a character-defining question . wanna hear it ?
you 're not a little girl , are you ?
are you ok ?
is he a good person ?
well , then it 's easy .
you are such a special man , george williams .
i think so .
well , you can wipe that disgusting smirk off your face
years go by , the kids burn you out , i 'm on the road ,
i have stayed married to a woman i don 't love ,
i can see that we 're just going to have to agree to disagree .
of course . i tell you everything .
we need a fresh start .
so many bad things have happened around here
ever since mom died i 've started to remember things .
nice and taut , like this .
lots of blood . mom screaming .
i remember killing dana .
i just want you to know that she 'd only be using you to even the score with me .
bree would never do anything like that . she 's a lady .
remember , they tend to end up with doctors . not pharmacists .
helen ! ok , go to the car . come on , please . just .. please .
i think that 's wise .
good , good . um ... we appreciate everything you 've done .
but what i don 't get is why you 're so nice .
it 's entirely up to her .
oh , whatever . lef 's not beat a dead horse .
ok . get it off your chest .
lynette , i 'm not my father .
and just so we 're absolutely clear , i am definitely not your mother .
i will take the kids , and you will never see any of us again .
get the patch kit !
you got to figure it out .
what 's going on , murph ?
murphy 's law doesn 't mean that something bad will happen .
and that sounded just fine with us .
get in , let 's go .
we lost it . no , we didn 't
let 's lay her down right there at the edge of the reservoir .
how long you think it 's been up there ?
so for ten years ?
i don 't know .
but only one to measure my son 's future ?
and a trained pilot .
okay , well , right now we don 't need more engineers .
the world needs farmers . good farmers , like you .
it was a brilliant piece of propaganda .
we need to teach our kids about this planet , not tales of leaving it .
if we had any of those left , the doctors would 've been able to find
which would have been a good thing , because she was always ..
it felt like they made something new every day . some
and every last one of them trying to have it all .
my daughter knew it , god bless her .
well , we used to look up in the sky and wonder ...
now we just look down and worry about our place in the dirt .
and you never got a chance to do anything with it .
you didn 't expect this dirt that was giving you this food ..
in april ... i believe i 'm right ... fifteenth of april , i think .
explain to me how you found this facility .
you 're sitting in the best-kept secret in the world .
cooper , please . cooperate with these people .
we learned these coordinates from an anomaly .
i hesitate to term it supernatural , but it definitely wasn 't scientific .
what sort of gravitational anomaly ? where was this ?
assurances ? yeah .
don 't you know who we are , coop ?
you know my father , professor brand .
i heard they shut you down , sir ..
when they realized that killing other people was
why secret ?
not while you 're struggling to put food on the table .
wheat seven years ago . okra this year .
and we 're growing more than we ever have .
soon .
not just ours , no . but it is our home .
blight does . and as it thrives , our air gets less and less oxygen .
and your daughter 's generation ..
murph is feeling tired . i was wondering if she could take a nap in my office .
alright
the last components of our one versatile ship in orbit , the endurance .
you sent people out there looking for a new home ?
i 've got kids , professor .
who 's " they " ?
mostly small distortions to our instruments in the upper atmosphere .
my crash . something tripped my fly-by-wire .
but of all these anomalies , the most significant is this
it appeared 48 years ago .
another galaxy .
someone placed it there .
and whoever they are , they appear to be looking out for us .
they 've put potentially habitable worlds right within our reach .
you sent probes into that ?
the lazarus missions .
the bravest humans ever to live .. led by the remarkable dr. mann .
but they could use hibernation to stretch that
hence the bravery .
data transmission back through the wormhole is rudimentary .
and one system shows promise .
one system with three potential worlds ?
okay .
there 's a plan a and a plan b
some kind of vehicle . a space station ?
the first gravitational anomalies changed everything
but you haven 't solved it yet .
the problem is gravity . how to get a viable amount of human life off the planet
over 5,000 fertilized eggs weighing in at just under 900 kilos .
after that , with surrogacy , the growth becomes exponential .
the real difficulty with colonization is genetic diversity .
but what about the people here ? you just ..
that 's why plan a is a lot more fun .
i will have solved the problem of gravity .
go away !
go ! if you 're leaving , just go .
what , because heading out there is what i feel like i was born to do ?
no , that does not make it wrong .
the why of the thing , that 's the foundation .
mankind was born on earth , it was never meant to die here .
i will
i need to fix this before i go .
something to me i never quite understood .
we 're just here to be memories for our kids . "
you said ghosts didn 't exist .
murph , look at me .
they chose me .
that 's exactly why you can 't go .
one word . know what it is ?
" stay . "
so alone .
it 's a perfect planet , and we won 't find another one like her .
the human race is going to be .
no . no attachments . my father insisted .
i 'm hoping we can surprise at least three of them .
dr. mann ?
hello , murph .
he wanted me to bring it for your brother .
she 's pretty upset with him for leaving .
murph is a bright spark .
she 's already making fools of her teachers .
so where are they ?
the next time you hear from cooper , they 'll be coming up on saturn .
administration wants me to repeat plant pathology . which sucks .
but they said i could start advanced agriculture a year early .
sorry , coop .
i 'll try again next time .
this gets to me , cooper . this . this .
say it , don 't spray it , rom . it 's a sphere .
no , it 's just that all the illustrations i 've ever seen , they ...
so they say you want to go from here to there .
what was that
ve 're here .
how ?
so years of basic data . no real surprises .
edmunds ' went down three years ago .
maybe . he was sending the thumbs up right until it went dark .
the planet is much closer to gargantua than we thought
miller 's and dr. mann 's planets both orbit it .
as a basketball around a hoop .
and a black hole that big has a huge gravitational pull .
no , it 's not that . it 's time .
how bad ?
seven years back on earth .
well , that 's relativity , folks .
cooper , we have a mission .
you can 't just think about your family . now you have to think bigger than that .
plan a does not work if the people on earth are dead by the time we pull it off .
okay . cooper 's right . we need to think of time as a resource ,
dr. mann 's data is promising , but it 's gonna take months to get there .
very promising . it 's water , it 's organics ..
and just think about the resources , including time ..
how far off from miller 's planet do we have to be to stay out of the time shift ?
all right , which is here , just outside of miller 's planet .
okay .
instead of taking the endurance into orbit around miller 's planet ..
then we take the ranger down , we get miller , we get her samples .
a literal heart of darkness .
the singularity , yeah , we 'd solve gravity .
nothing escapes that horizon .
coming back to find we 've failed .
back to the fourth iteration . jet 's run it through some new fields .
it only has to work once , murph .
we 've done wel for the world here
no , i 'm saying that you 've been trying to ...
and i don 't understand why .
can we take this point up at another time ?
stepping out into the universe
because of the black hole ?
accident is the first building block of evolution .
it sucks in asteroids and comets , other events which would otherwise reach you .
he 's remarkable . we 're only here because of him .
he 's on the ground , and he 's sending a very unambiguous message ,
we should vote .
brand ? he has a right to know .
but maybe we 've spent too long trying to figure all this out with theory .
when i say that love isn 't something we invented . it 's ..
it has to mean something .
hone
may be it 's some evidence , some ...
tm drawn across the universe to someone i haven 't seen in a decade
that transcends dimensions of time and space .
all right , cooper ...
the tiniest possibility of seeing wolf again excites me .
honestly , amelia ...
will you spend the night ? your room is exactly as you left it . it 's ready .
my sewing machine is in there , but there 's plenty ...
too many memories .
the dust .
could look at his lungs .
unless you 're punishing me for screwing up on miller 's planet .
if you 're wrong , you will have a very personal decision to make .
strike out on mann 's planet , and we 'll have to decide whether to return home
you might have to decide between seeing your children again ..
he 's been asking for you since he came to .
murph .
i let you all down .
it 's okay .
ust how good it can be to see another face .
my supplies were completely exhausted .
you have literally raised me from the dead .
hey , coop ?
i have a suggestion for your return journey .
i 'm going home , rom .
there 's a chance for the people on earth .
gargantua 's an older spinning black hole .
they 're hardly gentle . but the tidal gravity is so quick that
after the horizon is a complete mystery .
can glimpse the singularity and relay the quantum data ?
just when did this probe become a " he , " professor ?
i 'd need the old optical transmitter off kipfp , cooper .
of what makes us human . it 's not to be taken lightly
a while .
i don 't touch your stuff .
on these missions , don 't you , cooper ?
and we go live underground with you ? pray that daddy comes to save us ?
you 're gonna save everybody ? because dad couldn 't do it .
ie left us here to die
what about time slippage ?
about relativity right now , dr. brand .
once we 've gathered enough speed around gargantua ..
can cross the dimensions , including time .
do you have the quantum data ?
i am transmitting it on all wavelengths , but nothing is getting out , cooper .
but such complicated data to a child ?
what else ? oh , come on , dad .
understand its significance for years .
people on earth are gonna die . think !
they didn 't bring us here to change the past .
they didn 't bring us here to change the past .
we brought ourselves .
all right . let 's take it slow , sir .
remember , you 're no spring chicken anymore . actually , you are 124 years old .
the rangers found you with only minutes left in your oxygen supply
cooper station .
what ?
although she 's always maintained just how important you were .
so .. when i made my suggestion to miss cooper ..
it was just constant . just that steady blow of dirt .
we always set the plate upside-down .
well , my dad was a farmer . like everybody else back then .
we wore little things , little strips
she did confirm just how much you loved farming .
yeah . come here .
hey , is this . ?
do you want something more ?
better writing ability mostly .
no , no , no , no . no .
cantor .. eddie cantor ..
fuck it !
oh , oh , oh , what a gal .
you 're pathetic .
it would be easy if i were allowed to be an old man .
well chivalry is dead and gone .
it probably never existed anyway .
shut the fuck up !
i won 't go back .
please , come home .
you are the one who make him crazy .
you see what a dangerous child you 've created ?
we have to act out his fantasies
so what do you think i feel ?
never doubt , sancho .
we must always believe in ourselves ,
sancho , my son .
behold , i am rewarded for my penance .
go to her , sancho .
wait . how am i supposed to say that ?
uh , hello there .
i just brewed it .
holly , if you 're gonna hide , why couldn 't we have just talked on the phone ?
hey , nick .
the doctor says i kept saying " nick " over and over again .
who did ?
that 's why i phoned you .
when i left , i got to the elevator
the young guy was the boss .
nah . don 't think this is racial or anything ,
i can tell if a brit 's been in a room , just like that
now , this fighter guy , his name is danny demarco ,
he 's a son and heir and his daddy loves him
a lot bigger than you .
i will owe you forever .
do not fuck with these guys .
i hadn 't realized these places were so big
golden gate is much smaller .
by all means .
eh , tourist traps .
special forces , am i right ?
sbs ? srp ? sas ? : what were you ? sbs ? srp sas
it 's not something i 'm getting into with you .
that , and running around " all commando "
oh , hi , excuse me .
you knock the bottles over , they don 't roll away .
i want him so bad for what he did to me .
yeahn ?
a bout ?
well , he 's busy .
i don 't give a shit .
i try not to do that .
you 're the one that took the risk .
i 'm the one that took the beating .
a friend of mine left town .
how much longer you on this shift ?
what the hell , i shall keep you company .
you did something for me once . so believe this , bet small .
since it 's a d5 minimum , how 's if i bet five dollars ?
doubles , please , veronica .
so what do your friends call you ?
always wanted to be called ace or duke .
how are you not more excited ?
that make sense ?
anything else ? that 's all , thanks , hon .
thank you so much , nick .
guess you haven 't liked vegas much , huh ?
it 's just this creeping virus people catch sometimes .
i 'm off to corsica in the morning .
well , i 'll walk you out .
it 's just a loser 's dream .
this is not what i need .
after that i 'd just realize that every day
you won 't laugh ?
all right , i ..
and i didn 't have to ask for your qualifications .
i knew about the grapefruit juice , right ?
and i know about why you always sit
a while back in boston i saw this old guy on the street
just an old nut scared of the world .
i want you to teach me .
i need you to kill the fear that lives inside of me every day .
hey , listen , kid .
jesus . how ?
being smart is the only defense i 've ever had ,
you know how fuckin ' weird this is ?
i 'm pushing 40 , broke .
believe me , he could kill you with .
and the answer to your question is this .
nobody would ever dream that nick wild needed a gun
second and last .
how is it possible that i know that mr. demarco here
i saw it put there by a dear sweet lady
it 's easy to find out if i 'm lying ,
someone go get a microscope
i think you must , daniel .
i know it 's embarrassing ,
i won 't . i won 't .
it 's principle ! he ...
oh , daniel , you just blew the ballgame .
so you 're siding with him ?
believe this .
now you may go .
i 'm gonna see you real soon .
why do you think he did it ?
and he broke down and humiliated himself in front of them .
yeah
you 're one , too .
what i have to deal with is that
and if you can admit what you are ,
if i 'd won the full million ,
see me tap dancing ?
yeah , doubtful .
i 'm pretty sure this is what my soul looks like .
i guess caroline and i can do it .
i haven 't worked on the railroads like you .
han needs his " a , "
one tow ate up your whole morning .
cops wanted a statement .
that 's what people do .
what does it taste like ?
how do you do that ?
that 's 200 for the outer city service charge .
so i tell the moron that i 'm going to need put it
and this is my forth wreck of the shift .
how much is that little minnow get ya ?
it makes more if it sits in the lock collecting impound fees .
we rendered a tractor trailer .
i can 't keep up with these crazy drivers
he 's off at university studying to be a real
engineer ... i don 't care .
you 're ridiculous .
you better watch it , your hands are fucking filthy .
you guys are standing around like a bunch of pylons ?
none of you assholes deserve this
i got to ding you for a late fee .
and there is interest on the amount that you 're short .
next week , i promise .
drive safe , sir .
you 've been so helpful , i ...
nothing long term .
and i can 't get any training
yeah , i could put together some options .
what about short term ?
we used up all of my husbands inheritance just to move here .
how many times do i have to supply accountants ?
when your behind on your truck
dad !
are you working so much
kamal .
another week without a fight .
oh , ok. can i get you some coffee ?
i 'm looking for your husband .
.. wo cars and a motor cycle .
yes !
this is my vehicle .
can you tell me what happened tonight ?
have you been drinking tonight ?
i know who you are , counsellor .
hi , sir !
i was just waiting for the bus .
hey , jack rabbit ! what the hell aire wom doing ?
excuse me , ma 'am ! are you in need of assistance this evening ?
not a problem , officer . first truck , right there .
first truck , right there .
step back !
hey , makes you feel unsafe .
are you trying to poach my tow ?
he did that all doing a tow . he dropped a car on it .
hey ! what did i say !
first truck .
gosh !
the general public has the perception that
but you can be assured that i am trained .
i got your fucking tow .
i will impound your ride .
yes !
it 's entirely up to you .
a police contract starts next week .
show me one ounce of mercy .
raise way for life .
i 'm waiting on a tow truck .
911 , what 's your emergency ?
hello ? hello ! 911 .
is there anyone there who can help ?
i was afraid it was just gonna be us three .
i was about to end it if i had to listen
i 'm good .
goddamn it . sorry .
you still going with that plan ?
you know , there might be access
so we gotta fight our way into the church
sixty minutes until they hit the beach .
my father kept one in the garage .
we 're gonna use him to draw a crowd .
hey . time to move .
wake up .
no ! no ! stop it ! stop ! let go ! no !
thanks .
this communique will be repeated .
this is the invasion of hitler 's europe .
the men of general dwight eisenhower
i wasn 't even gonna play , but my brother al insisted .
" wrap your hands with the rope ... "
what are you doing ?
that looks like a pretty good match .
yes .
your manicure 's intact .
you mind if i take a look here ?
tony , how 's frankie ?
the bone 's still sticking out .
what 's he doing at our reunion anyway
lay off gunnar , cash . it 's not his fault .
you want to blame somebody , blame your uncle al .
huh ? any takers ?
he 's fine when he 's in utero , but once he 's out ..
which means he won 't be getting enough oxygen .
okay , so we 'll do the c-section ,
no , we can do the c-section in the cath lab .
deliver in one room and operate in the other .
i don 't see why not .
myers . dr. jason myers .
sounds like one nasty tug-of-war .
i 'm a journalist .
and they chose me to edit
whoa . whoa , whoa , whoa , whoa .
i will see to that .
you have lots of time to worry about your career .
okay .
just one . someone took my cell phone .
sure . right after the scan .
it 's gonna be okay , honey .
shh .
i can 't do this .
his heart is okay now .
i 'm not ready for him to die .
you have to do this .
we 're all here .
breathe with me .
you can do this .
she 's ready .
there 's some kind of an infection
you can just nod if i 'm close .
it 's not safe .
the infection came from one doctor and one doctor alone .
i 've been tested . i 'm clean .
if we don 't go right now , your son 's gonna die .
save my son .
yes , sir . they cleared me this morning .
so bailey did do something wrong .
i only said that to get their kid into surgery
we have traced the source of the infection to one doctor .
is a carrier of mrsa usa600 .
records show the surgical gloves
our testing reveals manufacturing defects .
these racist gestapo pigs
oh , come on .
jesus , linette .
you want to junk something ,
i thought you liked that rug .
it 's a 1941 jack kirby origin issue ,
super soldier serum , huh ?
it was intended for the entire us army ,
yes , sir , they had me in technical there ,
yes , sir .
there are elements in our society
in this city , at the present time ,
formerly allen donaldson .
i can see how that would be upsetting . come in .
oh , don 't bother . i 'll just sleep in leonard 's room .
well , he 's in my bed . why can 't i be in his ?
all right .
a modified roommate agreement for a temporary house guest .
this says you can make " end of life " decisions for me .
please sign .
there 's a reciprocity clause .
well , that seems fair .
ohh .. you poor baby .
nothing , nothing .
hey. you totally got that right !
aw , my little chubby cheeks is all grown up !
we don 't have much food .
ah , hands off , mister .
it 's not a party , mom . it 's just us .
you said they seem pretty rockin ' .
and besides , i don 't even know them .
be the new you .
no ! no .
i 'm not scared , mom . i 'm gonna move barley 's game .
well , he 's gotta learn how to clean up his toys .
that 's okay . i gotta get going .
we 'll perform the ceremony at school .
don 't do that . don 't do that . okay , bye !
what ?
oh , no . this was my dad 's .
yeah .
really ?
boy , i was so sorry to hear that he passed away .
you know , your dad was a great guy . so confident .
the man wore the ugliest purple socks every single day .
hey , that 's exactly what we asked .
i always wished i had a little bit of that in me .
my brother and i seek a map to a phoenix gem .
i have the parchment you desire right here . behold !
isn 't that fun ? they 're all based on my old maps .
corey , the karaoke machine 's broken again .
don 't worry , ladies ,
no , ian .
only reason i didn 't suffer the same fate ?
and it 's telling me we take an ancient trail
maybe not in the long run .
so , we should just take the expressway , right ?
listen , this one 's gone a little ...
you 're not going anywhere . we got questions for you .
okay , i think everything 's good here .
you can 't say you don 't agree .
what ?
i gotta get going . gotta get ian home .
sorry , i mean , i 'm feelin ' a little sick .
see you monday !
see , that 's why i never got married .
this is specter .
barley , i don 't know what happened back there .
i didn 't say you were .
well , the magic got it wrong .
the cop asked a question ,
i don 't know how any of this stuff works .
yeah , it 's gone wrong because you won 't listen to me .
because everything we 've done has been your idea .
what ? of course i do .
and i also think that would be good , normally ...
but , i told you , this isn 't a game .
what ?
i think he can feel the vibrations of the music ,
yeah . he 's really , really bad .
no , no , no . thanks , dad . dad , thank you .
okay . okay .
i 'm not really a big dancer .
i bet it goes something like this .
let 's call it , uh , 10 .
forged of the rarest metals ,
turns out this sword
laurel ?
wait !
we 're heading on a quest z
welcome to the path of peril .
well , you know , they never really developed around here .
we lower that bad boy
found it .
okay , i got this .
you can 't cast a levitation spell on something that far away .
this is actually kinda cool .
brace yourself , young mage .
colt , we know where the boys are going .

it can 't be .
what suite ?
from what haggerty told me , i knew there was a lot of money in this deal
how you doing ? jack harris .
i like that .
it 's a win / win situation . the consumer gets what they want ,
so we take a cut from the people that are already out there making this stuff ,
oh , my god !
i mean , that is an insane amount of money
yeah .
i mean , that 'd be kind of shitty to cut him out now , don 't you think ?
he 's got federal agents all over him pretty much all the time .
he didn 't tell us he was gonna be charged .
no . i think what you 're saying makes sense . i just feel ...
yeah , well , i 'd be the one dealing with the russians , ok ?
the next morning , i flew back to la .
we were just gonna be the middle men .
wait a ... wait a minute . excuse me . i 'm out ?
wanna take care of them ? gimme the money back .
what 's it gonna be , jerry ?
yeah ? great .
after i had haggerty taken care of ,
the deal was , i 'd be out in a year .
for the rest of our lives .
ivan , jack harris .
i 'm not here to socialize .
i 'm not your fucking friend . where 's my money ?
what are we gonna do now ?
we 're not gonna do anything . we don 't mention this to anybody ever . all right ?
we gave it to him .
he ... he 's floating down at the bottom of the pacific ocean .

i paid him , we had a few drinks , we had a few laughs , and he left .
ivan never got home .
what ?
the figure was 200 .
hey , hey , hey , what you fucking saying ?
what 's he saying by disappearing with your money ?
dude , chill out .
i guess our clientele was distracting his workers . but it didn 't matter .
yeah !
i think i want that up in the back left bedroom .
hey , babe .
how you doing ?
hey , buddy , how you doing ?
i got you this .
i just couldn 't do that .
i saw that shit .
you ... you start to go home less and less .
well , i mean , i wouldn 't exactly call myself an absentee father .
so , i 'm trying to take a little skim , for christ 's sakes ?
and what , you throw me a tuna fish sandwich ?
and then , so ... so tell me , what .. what do i get ?
i took care of you , ok ? i 've paid my debt to you .
yeah , really .
listen , i 'm serious . all right ? we 're finished .
yeah , we are , jerry .
in the beginning , jack said you were under indictment .
you 've got fbi looking up your ass right now .
we work together , make a partnership .
now , what about jack ?
they took him !
you call police , we kill your boy .
yeah ? jack . i have your son .
i will call you tonight with what i want .
good .

you say it 's not jack 's boy ?
this is the housekeeper 's son .
we are caucasian people , ok ?
you know , he 's gonna call the cops !
it 's a mexican !
shut up !

sit the fuck down .
where 'd you find these people anyway ?
i 've done this before .
this is the west of the pecos rodeo , featuring america 's number-one team ,
and it 's brought to you by charlie goodnight and all those good people
and first out of the chute is pj puznowski from down terlingua way .
gonna try to put a rope around rodney from the lazy i sickle y bar ranch .
haystacks , dusk .
old man just called me up .
no , no , no .
what ? come in . have them proof it quick as possible .
have a look at these .
arrives at heathrow in about an hour . you 'll pick her up .
a reproduction , though , in my opinion .
on the fact that it 's hanging on the wall of a caravan , sir , in texas .
the cowgirl , sir .
you stupid bastard , what !
before we throw you into the thick of it ,
on september 15th , 1891 , during the course of one very productive day ,
" haystacks , dusk " was put on display in paris at the jeu de paume .
" haystacks , dusk " was carted off to carinhall ,
the point platoon is led by sergeant brian " bulldog " puznowski ,
for the next 67 years , the whereabouts of haystacks , dusk
major , for heaven 's sake , just be gentle .
no , that 's enough .
other countries , other customs .
i remember one night in botswana .
this wasn 't the plan , major . how are we going to get back on plan ?
faces still on right ways round ?
i do apologise on merle . he just loves a brawl .
an expedient we might consider if we spend much more time in texas .
his door is rather firmly shut at the moment .
yes , thank you , i 'll wait .
welcome to the jungle . we 're here to help you cut through ..
go right in , mr deane .
our publications here at shabandar media .
publication ever , without the ... qualification of shabandar media ,
good god , no .
a birthday party . they had ponies . little shetland ponies .
i was , oh , six , seven years old .
he 's a speech pathologist now .
is there something i can help with ?
you see , i snuck an advance peek , as i said , at the horse and hunt .
equestrienne , not a mutant or a mythical creature .
so , shall we sit ?
well , everybody knows the answer to that one .
indeed . and where are you staying ?
i can 't remember the name of it . you remember , harry ?
mamacita ! i bet this place has cable .
the major gave me a rag to dry this
very , very small . tiny , in fact . just for one evening .
not even the whole evening necessarily . we could just use it for ..
all i see for this evening is a very comfortable suite overlooking the river .
hold on . what 's the tariff ?
there 's moral issues . right and wrong .
the major has made quite a mess here . it 's really embarrassing
just run that through .
there seems to be a problem with this card . perhaps you 've exceeded the limit .
i don 't know why i worry . you ain 't up to it anyway .
the major is quite capable .
very good , sir . this one worked brilliantly .
this evening , it is very important to stay on topic . keep it businesslike .
what 's that supposed to mean ?
he 's up to something . he excluded me from your little date .
anyway , now i prefer the impressionists .
say , your english is pretty darn good there , martin .
oh , thank you . well , i speak eight languages fluently .
i pluck chickens , so there ain 't a lot of call for me
i 'm unfamiliar with this expression , " i pluck chickens . "
this painting was hanging always in your house ,
bloody hell .
harry is , as you say , out on his butt .
something a little desperate about the man .
a little shifty , a little weak .
and though his accomplice might seem , shall we say , less than perfect ,
so how is his lordship this evening ?
he wasn 't rude or bullying , i hope .
hey , harry , what are you doing with all your quarters ?
hardly . i do this periodically so as to have use of the jar .
tea ?
you know , hoss , i don 't think it 's gonna work out .
we have the painting , or so shabandar believes .
on plan , don 't you understand ?
second thoughts ? well , it 's a little late for that , young lady .
don 't you hoss me , young lady .
i have invested thousands of pounds in this little caper of ours ,
what is it anyway ? cold feet , moral qualms again ?
besides , the man is a cold-blooded , heartless bully .
charming ?
i knew you were naive and provincial ..
i respect your origins , your entire double-wide way of life ,
but you 're fired .
yep .
let me remind you who 's running this little enterprise , madam . moi .
in clue course , when i have authenticated the major 's beautiful work , then ,
this would be comical if it weren 't actually dangerous .
perhaps since our little caper is far from over ,
that was the third time , sir .
what are we going to do about zaidenweber who , once hired on ,
leaving that on the american express card , are we , sir ?
now , the task this evening is quite straightforward .
well , now the boot is on the other foot .
he 's still pissed off that i beat him to haystacks , dawn .
splendid . book that for you straightaway .
housekeeping .
sometimes i wonder if they drink .
good evening .
yes , thank you . got ' em right here .
no , no , i shouldn 't think so .
extraordinary fellow .
harry deane , are you spying on me ?
well , like momma always used to say ,
well , harry deane , it ain 't gonna happen .
you got your own thing going on ,
it 's ok , you know . you being you is ... is ok .
consider that you might still have an obligation ,
more than a nuisance , a bloody dangerous situation .
hardly to no end . it is my job to ensure the integrity of the collection .
sorry to have to break it to you like this ,
i had to advance him two years ' salary .
everything is just quite the way it should be .
gross depiction , maybe , but the finer fingerprints of technique , no ,
this is authentic .
and as for you , you 're either rather clever or not clever enough .
speaking of clever , what did you expect ?
and besides , i was never gonna be any use to you .
just a bit of a waste of time , that 's all .
you will continue in the job .
i think not , sir .
i think not regarding continuing in the job .
i thought we were working with these people .
i 'm gonna make a call .
mr. burrows .
our deal is contingent upon the retrieval of scylla .
i swear to god , man , when i ,
michael 's getting treatment . with you .
but don 't worry .
mr. oren is waiting in his limousine .
because if any of my men spot him ,
if we take turns sleeping we can be there by tomorrow night .
michael , he took the company 's deal to save your life .
it 's more complicated than that .
listen to me ,
you know what , man ? you need to grow up .
there 's only one person ican think of that fits that description .
if she was operating out of this house ,
gretchen said she thought that this could be an inside job .
i rip open the wrapping paper
oh , yeah , except it 's not even a birdhouse .
i 'm so sorry .
thank you .
i got my weigh station ticket
you 'll see i got it right here .
what about the main door ?
i 'm sure it 's latched from the outside .
maybe .
help me out .
maybe we won 't have to .
this should work .
you need to acknowledge that our chance
we need to start thinking in terms of contingencies .
general krantz refused to adjust
are you honestly comparing me to him ?
but if you can 't tell the difference
here he is. would you like to take the call ?
good afternoon , christina .
then call me .
may i escort you to your table ?
i 'm glad you got my message .
at least now i know where michael gets it from .
look , i could sit here for days and try to explain to you
what if general krantz were no longer in the picture ?
but i need time , lincoln .
if you give me two days ...
all right .
but if krantz suspects any of this ,
how will i get in touch with you ?
mrs. burrows has the item ,
i pull the trigger .
don self ,
i have no idea what you 're referring to .
i swear to god , i smelled chicken blood .
you want to turn this into something ?
if there aren 't any chickens , there aren 't any chickens .
the smell was coming from back there .
i cannot let you to disrupt it .
i insist , you cannot do that .
please .
well , another sleepless night thanks to your snoring .
you want to see if you can hit all the red lights ?
luckily for jeff ,
it 's friggin " christmas , for god sake .
tricia reed 's husband got her a new car .
he bought it for her because she beat cancer .
don 't beat it , i 'll buy you two .
oh ! my chest hurts like hell . take the controls .
ah ! you gotta land the plane .
you can 't do this to me !
hey , is it just me ,
dad , i think it 's gonna crash .
so they hung up a banner ...
and put up santa 's workshop ,
look at this mess . it 's like santa 's colon .
hilarious . almost as funny as when orson said it last year .
almost .
he can 't even get the newspaper on my porch .
hey , what is going on with you two ?
susan 's right .
oh , crap . who 's dead now ?
something 's happened to katherine .
was she okay ?
i hope she didn 't do something to herself .
you were still a little groggy .
um , maybe i was dreaming .
okay .
please .
i 'll have someone bring you that soup .. danny .
i know .
it 's hospital policy .
so you have two stupid policies .
i know what 's going on .
i knew something was up
well , we 're private people . is there a law against that ?
where you going with all this , mona ?
you are one sharp cookie .
honestly ?
no offense .
i can 't believe i 'm right .
you could 've called my bluff and walked away anytime .
i will pack after breakfast .
these you made are delicious , i 'll miss them .
that mike didn 't do this .
i 've got seven stitches
why would mike want to stab you ?
will you stop lying ?
katherine , please !
to go this far to keep me from being with someone else .
i don 't know anymore .
okay . so tell me howl get the crazy part committed .
really ?
is there a sign over us that says " crap here " ?
i 'm looking for a job , and in the meantime ,
yes , but remember ,
i am so sorry .
for what i have done to this family .
penny is clipping coupons .
well , we 'll get some money if we win the lawsuit .
at least gaby tried to apologize and stop this .
damn it !
that was the chairman of my board .
so when the plane flies over the christmas panty ,
glorious . that 'll be 600 bucks .
he can . our anniversary ?
well , you didn 't have to cook that night .
good luck , mr. mayer .
almost as much as i wish i had said no .
oh , for god sake !
can 't i have one moment of peace ?
i know . that 's why i don 't go to the
i don 't know . would you be upset if i brought her ?
gaby , please talk to me . i feel just awful .
you 're an awful person .
thanks , lynette .

you just don 't care about anyone but yourself .
sorry you are no longer a part of that group .
it 's a christmas miracle !
nick , what do you want from me ?
we got the emergency 10 grand ,
karl ? what are you doing here ?
stop it ! we can 't be seen together .
susan knows . the cat 's out of the bag .
remind me not to let him make a toast at our wedding .
now just go before he figures it out .
uh , you know that christmas present i mentioned ?
i 'm not sure i can stop it . it 's being delivered ... by air .
you haven 't even seen it yet .
i thought i 'd offer the kids a chance
how come you guys never had a career day ?
no . no .
what ? ! guess what ? he 's not talking to you . he 's talking to me .
a guy walks into ... no .
no ! i haven 't told it !
great throw . you were right .
ball 's in your court !
who wants a gil pickle ?
all right . come on . grab one .
genius .
claire wasn 't a fan .
do you hear that , ladies ?
and you 're gonna be chasing that high for the rest of your life .
she just sold a house .
actually , it went a little better than it did in rehearsal ,
all right .
i 'm building a retail office development ,
well , yeah . you know people in city hall ,
name one .
... and let 's not forget shower snacks .
hey , jay . my mom said you were writing a book .
by the way , career day was a little weird .
where 's my daughter ?
your mom has a deadline . she asked me to watch you today .
so where do you want to go , the museum of natural history ?
why would i want to do that ? i 'm not ten .
uh , fine .
er teachers are really worried about her .
oh , really ? and you find that a big surprise
my label 's completely lost all faith in me .
force of habit . if i look homeless , it 's because i practically am .
i 'm sleeping on a shitty mattress in some shitty apartment ,
unbelievable .
so , uh , your fridge in here is stocked with food .
this is your driver 's number and my cell phone number . i 'll leave that here .
i 'm really happy to be here and more than happy
whew .
rolling stone .
yhat 's that
30d .
he 's saying , " look , it 's a guitar , but it 's not .
i am gonna shoot this because you have to play that
i was inspired in la .
wow , yeah .
i 'd be very interested in that .
i don 't know what to say .
maybe it 'll go away . maybe it 'll fade .
do you want to put your head this end or this end ?
do you want a tea ?
i 'm gonna wing it . i 'll wing it .
yep . i got it .
j can 't sing . i can play a bit of guitar ,
can i dad ?
i 'm a bit taken aback by this . this is incredible .
i 've been practicing this speech into a shampoo bottle
nice beard , you fucking loser .
don 't say it like a posh english girl ,
say , " i 'm in the fucking zone . "
i 'm gonna write a song , i don 't give a shit .
so .. you understand how this .. could have happened ...
dr. blake is on your service .
or i can . you just say the word .
you don 't have to .
you sure ?
uh , s-sir ? sir , y-you can 't park there .
no , this is for patients only .
oh . of course .
okay , well , let 's not skip steps .
i need to know what dillard taught you .
i will do another check , post-op .
edwards , show her where it is .
you invited her on your service , too ?
and you should , too .
forget it .
as i feared ,
this is about a little boy who had to see his family murdered ,
he deserves the best care he can get ,
you saw the scans . you 're a good surgeon .
i wasn 't hopeless .
because there 's nothing here to save .
well , that 's thinking ahead . i like that .
i thought i 'd stop in to see how the first day was going .
blake has been dictating my surgical steps .
if i had done what she just suggested ,
i ... what ?
dr. grey , i know this procedure .
if your hands had been my hands on this patient ,
step away from the table .
dr. grey is what 's wrong .
you were hazing her .
blake was at the top of her class at dillard .
you checked ?
you checked her case record ?
did you know that she ...
you were the only reason not to hire her .
your labs are within normal limits .
i 'm on every website .
but we 'd have a base for a proximal phalanx ,
maybe we could sculpt the bone and graft the gap in between ?
i mean , then i could actually make something out of that .
i didn 't think you 'd want me to .
i didn 't want you here , either .
and be reminded of the best and worst times of my life .
talented , smart ..
and i decided that wasn 't fair to you .
rise above .
every day .
derek ... he probably would have even liked her .
slow night , mr. torrance .
you 're a whiskey man , are you not ?
onthe house .
two maybe three days .
we are not empty handed .
and the golden embroidery on her dress .
and special birds reward the special bounty .
for sure
you are not under ring harald 's command any more .
for them , the great fire shall burn until
they took her as a prisoner , my king
raise
we discovered them climbing the cliffs .
now they caught lady inghean and you are still free
was that really necessary , mercenary ?
but can not question a dead man , can you ?
his daughter is in the hands of few vikings
they have no their weapons
you bring my daughter back to me alive .
if it 's not possible to free her ...
your father would never have 20t to see this mess .
and you 're under my command now .
come here .
or what ?
true . but wounded by an arrow .
who are you ?
yes , he 's pretty good .
and why should we trust you ?
lay your wounded comrade here .
if i tell , will i be let go ?
there were we found them .
yes .
what kind of father would not ?
that you will not touch a hair on that girl .
do not believe the rumors
that 's bjorn , the son of ovar ,
you and your little faith .
come on .
we do not have much choice now
so , what you know about them ?
he is be feeling honored .
her father will not pay for her . he wants her dead
perhaps her father will not pay .
now , move .
is that simple ? that 's simple . except for here .
and we will break through them .
but there is another way .
hold it . so now we will be led by a monk ?
he is not leading you .
asbjorn , the monk is not one of us .
who gave us a shelter , who helped us to escape ?
your decision ..
the path of the serpent .
and ends , down at the sea .
but at the next full moon , winter storms begin .
that 's only the few days time .
thanks to you .
but all take more than pray the language dunchaid 's men .
the land of the pagans .
they accepted me as one of them own .
it wasn 't who king harald settle upon
jorund come out war on fought with me and my father .
so , you are not welcome among your home ?
tonight should be my wedding night .
it was a profitable move for my father .
ake that shirt off before i cut it off
hey , that worked .
keep going . keep going , you 're ..
yeah , yeah , yeah . i want those hands down there .
and i want those panties off ,
and really sexy when you 're violent .

ude !
this is the first time i 'm seeing these .
these are amazing .
oh , my god ! a bong ?

it 's kind of threatening , right ?
it 's not letting me take a screen grab .
let 's just get out of here .
all right . i see you guys tomorrow . hey !
kyle ?
hey , i got an idea .
hey , billie , why don 't you lay off ? i got this one .
easy one .
hello . can i share a secret with you ?
ree live cams are the absolute best .
there 's simply nothing better than that .
someplace that is truly us .
somewhere that no one in their right mind
yes , completely .
your sabre mazurka is two weeks away ,
the big deal ?
it 's what makes you an addams .
i hear it 's like thanksgiving .
i 'm more of a demolitions man .
roman candles . bang snaps . holy hand grenades .
they are coming from all over the world
all right , pop . i 'll practice .
putrid .
hey !
bad kitty ! that 's a bad kitty !
please , don 't worry . i 'll sleep in the attic .
i 've practiced that move in a lot of people 's homes .
why ever would you ask that , dear ?
in a summer patchouli roast .
hmm . you know , i 'm looking for something a bit stronger .
mmm ! morticia , you have to try these coffee grounds .
just a moment , what am i hearing ?
wow , that is absolutely horrible !
they 're greeting us with one of their traditional songs .
isn 't it great when we are all together ?
how rude .
morticia , this is not the old country .
but deep down , we 're all the same .
we have to win them over .
well , good morning , neighbor !
gomez addams . at your service .
charmed .
hey. neighbor !
nice to , uh , meet you .
how 'd you like a free home makeover
i don 't wanna brag ,
yes , well .. when is a good time to stop by ?
darling ..
oh , wonderful ! then it 's settled .
you 're welcome in advance ! ta !
her face reminds me of a death mask .
but it 's printing my work .
we can come back .
oh , dr. yang , that 's perfect .
he should 've waited for the ambulance .
we don 't know that yet , alex .
that 's all right .
long-lost father ? i mean , i 'd have a billion .
is he gonna be okay ?
also , his neck is broken .
he can move , right ?
we 're doing everything that we can .
wow , you look ...
don 't say i look nice .
but i can see where it 's going .
i 'm hunting bridesmaids .
are you gonna be there ?
he saw you in your underwear at and didn 't bat an eye .
you don 't have to justify it to me .
it 's what you did all through med school
you 've become the thing you worship .
hey .
i mean , it 's like you said .
i turned out all right , so ...
l just want my family again .
all right , i turned out all right because you left .
we won 't know until we open him up .
yang 's at the wedding . i 'm here .
i did a pericardial window by myself .
then find russell or page the on call doctor .
i cannot believe we 're doing this .
ah . there . ventricular perf .
okay . we put him on bypass , right ? and put a patch on .
i 'll throw a stitch in . i 've seen yang do it .
the time has come for us to consider ...
my succession .
while you are my eldest son ,
nor have i sought it .
he is soft , but he is eager .
i will assume that this news comes as neither surprise nor disappointment .
to say it to you directly .
i set off tomorrow .
you need not fight .
i have said ...
it says it is a bird from constantinople .
if i may , my liege .
a wonder .
of all at this table , none have i known longer than i have you .
we were raised together . you 're like an older brother to me .
let 's hope its magic isn 't black and unholy .
a ball .
no , my liege .
this one is sent only for me .
the ball is an insult to you and to your kingdom .
i acknowledge my neglect of you , john .
these concerns are mine and mine alone .
it speaks to the loneliness of the position in which i find myself .
every waking moment .
i 'm here because you are my friend .
a king has only .. followers ... and foe .
the first command i 'll heed .
you 'll have to carry out that mass execution yourself .
you are not that man .
show your feeling in here , with me .
how dare you defy me ? i am the king .
you 've been mute since we crossed the sea .
where is the fearsome old warrior falstaff ? !
too often have i seen men of war
and this here is the war that you have chosen to wage .
lord dorset , summon your fastest rider .
dartmouth !
tell me what lies over that hill . ride fast , return directly .
yes , life dealt me a bad uniform ,
and this is exciting .. look .

you 're her babysitter . you already have-a connection .
see ? that 's your limited vision .
i mean , gay , martha stewart ... we can 't top that .
see ? " max 's homemade cupcakes . "
see ? there it is .
but the name sucks a big one .
that 's where he carries all his stress .
max , we 're using our spa voice today .
i can 't afford this .
toxins ?
i can 't be sure what the woman i buy that from
if everything isn 't perfect ,
speaking of the ... the party ,
i don 't need it . it 's just more like ...
um , but , uh , the thing is , there 's the cards ,
i was not saying a word .
i 'm done with whatever this is that you 're doing .
just remember ,
let me see what you 're drawing , johnny .
and you tricked me .
max , you gave peach the cards .
no . shut it . do it .
i asked a guy for help .
oh , is he going to climb up your long blonde hair
who did you invite ?
no . no , no , no , no .
i had a weird thing with him at the diner last night .
i don 't know what we are .
it 's a hard life out on the trails .
i do declare ,
" i do declare " is not cowboy .
are you thinking about the celery ?
now i 'm thinking about the celery .
not weird , really ... more , um , intense .

you gotta go in there and tell them ...
" put the game out there now , for people to buy it . "
i don 't understand what you 're saying .

one extra touch for you .
oh god , no .
you put this in your mouth . ow . ryan !

oh , it 's not true ? no .
hey , o 'malley , where are you going ?

when i came up with it , it was cool .
that really hurt my feelings .
now , i 'm going to pitch my game again
i didn 't win ..
what if we made a game so visceral ...
don 't think of it as a game .
you are a cop .
situations that are dangerous .
where it felt like you could actually get killed .
they blast and rip through everything .

or you 're gonna endure something that is ..
josie , you gotta go , okay ?
what are you talking about ? don 't come ..
why do you keep saying that ?
but what 's most important is that you leave right now .
no one you want to know .
sorry to bother you gentlemen . i need to come in ..
just don 't hurt him . this was my idea .
i 'm the only one ...

how else would we ever have fresh linens ?
i 'm trying to help you , shirl .
i don 't want strangers here . i don 't like them .
fred 's going to lighten my class load
you can 't expect me to indulge this , can you ?

now , back to our game .
oh , of course . it 's right here in my hand .
what 's up ?
it 's not about you .
fine .
leonard will be here in a moment .

i 'm so disappointed it didn 't work with him and penny .
out of deference to them ,
i changed it . i-i colored it .
wait . you thought i was someone else .
no , no .
you are pathetic and hypocritical
you can 't pull that off .
and you 're. you 're a brunette .

and i did not do this for mark . i just ...
clear c-spines clinically ,

what 's going on ?
they need , like , a clean bill of health from me or something .
yeah . i mean , i 'm not ready to be a mom .
have you told mark ?
i mean , don 't you guys have some kind of rule
do you think she needs an extra blanket ?
sorry ?
i bet you take better care of her than her own husband .
she would try anything we served .
fearless .
it became ..
then one night , she came in with him .
that ring on her finger ?
i got a surprise for you . oh , could i see this again ?
you win .
he 's not gonna tell her now .
she heard everything . she has to say something .
but my family is smart , driven ,
they don 't look like me , which had its perks ,
they never pushed me , never thought to .
hard .
my point is that you can 't just change your hair .
can we talk about it ?
we can talk about it .
patient room . guy 's in a coma .
anything happen ?
oh ! oh , my god . i 'm starving .
now you can see what they are .
her boring husband 's in surgery .
but she just found out ,
but it 's okay if he does ,
probably .
well , i didn 't marry derek to be the chief 's arm candy .
yeah , you married him for the great surgeries .
right .
ooh . shh . she 's gonna say something .
oh . what did she say ?
she 's got a big air leak in her chest tube .
grey , see if an o.r. is available just in case .
we 'll let you know more as soon as we do .
we 're ready .

so i-i went down to the pound ' cause i-i ...
and i-i held all of these incredibly sweet dogs ,
i went out and got a fish instead .
oh , i got a bikini wax .
you were my best friend !
and now you won 't even look at me .
you said you loved me , too , and then ..
you chose her , too . you chose her , too .
when i talk to you , i feel like i 'm cheating on her .
and i miss my best friend , too .
this is the closest i 've been to inside an o.r. in a week .
now i 'm paged about ...
b.p. ' s 80 over 60 and falling .
come on .
stay with me now . come on . stay with me .
i can 't .
i ... i ...
i made a mistake last year .
if you don 't feel the losses ...
that 's when you know you 're not cut out for this kind of work .
dude , if you 're going to be an astronaut ,
the other guys have to give it to me .
the other astronauts have to give you your nickname .
i am brown dynamite .
you can 't go home .
oh .. can 't you take the bus to the dentist ?
two years ago ,
see ? it 's right here after " providing a confirmation sniff
i 'm your roommate , not your chauffeur .
ask anybody .
hold on .
yeah , well , tell it to someone who cares .
next week i fly to houston
he 's gonna learn to poop in space .
maybe your nickname should be " brown dynamite . "
'sup ?
i would 've been here sooner ,
oh , your concern for me is touching .
i 'm sorry , sheldon , i 'm busy .
i 've got a lab full of alcoholic monkeys ,
sheldon , that 's not what girlfriends are for .
howard doesn 't make me do his shopping
but when ma 's hips give out , you 're up , kid .
all right , then ,
okay , w-we can circle back to that one .
anyone ?
um , all right , uh , dermatologist .
what do you say you take me over there , buddy boy ?
yes . now , i can 't make any promises ,
i can 't take you to the dentist .
it has to come from the other astronauts .
like how ?
did it work ?
because they took away my yo-yo
plant the seed .
they don 't call me " brown dynamite " for nothing .
hey , did you ever make it to the dentist ?
mostly they cater to dogs , but ..
all right , sheldon ,
if you admit that you 're a 30-year-old man
i will admit nothing of the sort .
oh , good , your power 's out , too .
because last month ,
implementing power-failure protocol .

you know , in girl scouts , tammie dineesha said
anyway , you want to make out ?
okay .
i can go so slow it 'll be like there 's a snail in your mouth .

andrew , it 's etiquette . nobody wants to read the truth at christmas .
honey , would you put on another cd ? something with sleigh bells .
okay .
good point .
that 's lobster !
why do i have to be the fussy snob ?
ashvsash.cot came in and straightened up . i wanted everything to look nice for you .
i 'm home , but it doesn 't really feel like home .
the important thing is that you 're back from the hospital ,
you 're grounded , remember ? !
i just survived a hostage situation .
you keep your nephew away from my daughter or else .
just let it run its course .
i 've been modeling for two years ,
i 've got some wardrobe choices .

i can 't believe you did this !
i just love the sauce .
you 'd never ask a magician how a trick is done .

i was just wondering why you 're here .
okay , let 's suppose il just had a massive head injury and believe you .
okay ! maybe i will share my secret ingredient .
paprika ! there , it 's out !
i was wondering when she 'd show up .
16 years of being perfect .
that 's what i don 't get .
why can 't you trust me about austin ?
it doesn 't matter how smart you are .
you do your homework . i 'm gonna finish the laundry .
i 'm not going back to that place .
let 's get my mother back to the home , shall we ?
oh , yeah , there was a little tension earlier , but i think it 's all been resolved .
no , absolutely forbid it !
you should 've heard her in the car .
i don 't core .
how can you be so cold ?
i 've worked my entire life to get away from that woman .
what could she possibly have done to make you hate her so much ?
we 're about to fetch you some of those coins squire .

trade 's dried up .
five years .
five years cleaning my master 's boots .

that 's when brude began his reign of terror ,
i need to find him .
he has the dragon 's eggs .
there 's no telling what he might do with them .
the time to face brude will come soon enough ,
are you sure ?
i 'm only concerned for your safety .
you must have felt something when you touched my heart ?
she grows on you , does she not ?
" the answer is no , by the way .
well , laugh , if you will .
well , a man is a man , is he not ?
at least that 's what we believe .
no , this side is inside .
you built the wall to keep us in .
it was built to keep you out ,
when a female dragon finds a male worthy ,
i do not .
first it was pain , sorrow .
we 're being chased by a murderous sorcerer .
a true knight would be able to train hard
what are they waiting for ?
they can 't get over the wall .
waiting for drago .
a knight is sworn to valor .
just poetry , boy .
and you 'd still have
see ? i 've taught you something
a knight is only worth his profit !
body temp should be higher than that , right ?

what appears to be a broken nose .
that 's not what killed him , though .
can 't find the exit wound .
more than likely the bullet 's still in his head .
no cash . it 's consistent with robbery .
there 's a struggle .
then fowler makes a break for it .
then fowler makes a break for it
personal experience says it 's probably his ex-wife .
taking a break ?
that is a lot of people .
see , we 're talking 34th century ,
excellent distraction ,
all right , well ,
54 in just one minute .
you don 't gain a single point .
a type of attack like this would do it .
so you can get out of the pits
i got a lot of people riding on me .
oh , yeah ? well , who 'd you put your money on , greg ?
i hold my cards close to the vest and my cash even closer .

the point is , your victim was staring at the inside
so , why would a hardcore gamer pound sedatives
can you solve this someplace else ?
yeah , it just went to the top of my stack .
how many pills did you give him ?
you crushed up his pills , spiked his drink
the only thing that i had a crush on was stevie .
he was a gamer and ..
dude , i 'm rolling a natural here
iif ou think for one second
dude , that 's my corpse .
haven 't you seen the social network ?
look , i 'm really sorry i fell a little behind .

but how do you prove it ?
now we can actually print it .
and i 'll print the pizza box .
pizza , pizza .

sara and i ran prints on the pizza box and zolpidem bottle .
so i delivered a pizza to a friend .
no , i understand .
i 'm from the east coast .
he accounted for all of the electronics
worth about ten grand ,
all right .
i pulled some very interesting trace from your gun .
then tries to make it all look like a break-in .
and hodges proved that it is possible
apparently .
now why would he go through so much trouble to make a suicide
look , the man 's life was in pieces .
his ex-wife had to come bail him out .
then carl jansen beats him up .
maybe ben thought there was a way
she 's having some trouble with her heart ,
dr. monroe , call the pharmacy . dr. monroe , call the pharmacy .
are we in that big of a rush ?
and what was her name again ?
dean . really ?

the smoke you inhaled is making your lungs work harder .
it doesn 't take that much .
you just roll down the window , grab a bunch , bring ' em home .

i can see that .
and i 'm not sleeping with the fan on tonight . i hate that sound .
uh-oh . what , what , what ? you 're gonna yell at me ? i can see this . hang on .

suzi , my darling bride ,
my nephew , charles , who always finds a way to keep me on my toes .
vikram , whose family fortunes have always been intertwined with my own .
all i ever wanted was a son , and here you are .
i 've spoken to all of you about your position in my will .
you are all leeches .
sorry to single you out like that , ms. ballard .
okay . what 's next ?
captain wong , is there any way you can lock off this place ?
so we should then start questioning the suspects .
we 're not questioning anybody .
then you radio interpol , tell ' em we 'll meet ' em at the docks in monaco .
for the investigation ?
the rest of you , i 'd lock yourselves in your chambers or your yacht rooms
my name is inspector laurent delacroix .
why is that smoke ring so good ? how did he do that ?
tell me about malcolm quince .
swine .
he was a complicated man .
yo , mr. french policeman , man . it was mad .
i thought i saw something move , and i shot .
the old man got what was coming to him .
perhaps i will have that word with you independently .
i can get up .
i 'll be out in a minute .
i 'm sorry . she 's just excited because it 's , she reads books , and this is fun for her .
unfortunately , i do not believe liars .
and how long have you been lying to your wife ?
you did not think that we would investigate your background ,
you are , how you do say , cop on the beat , not detective as you so claim .
there 's ... that 's not a crime .
you 're just improvising , pal , and it 's getting weird .
i will repeat this message in english .
well , i heard that .
did you lie to me ?
where are you ?
oh , okay .
we are being framed right now .
you had three lines , and you went by your birth name ,
madeleine leboutillier , your mother .
i wasn 't even in the room when malcolm quince was murdered .
the lights . you turned out the lights .
and then you killed tobey so that you could just keep all of it .
so you had to get rid of us .
oh , l , what were you thinking , kid ?
they won . they 'll always win .
put veronica back on .
attempted murder .
i guess bail is out of the question ?
anything you can do ?
but he needs to show some remorse .
but where his head 's at right now , he won 't listen to me .
lincoln , there 's no way .
you are now a witness in his criminal investigation .
you are not to make a move on burrows under any circumstance .
you know what , trixie ?

i guess so .
goodnight , everyone .
caroline , you 're sharing a room with me .
max , you 're sharing a room with topher and lady marmalade .
and do not fear .
how are you ?
i thought you should 've been there . i was out voted .
richard .
ransom . little shit . missed the funeral .
we 're ready for you now . we 'd like to see you one at a time .
i 'm assuming this will all be wrapped up before the memorial tonight .
kids today , with the internet . it 's amazing .
i mean , we 're all gutted , but i was happy to have that night with him .
it 's like i can still feel his hand on my shoulder .
so , we 're here with joni thrombey , harlan thrombey 's daughter in law ?
and then neil passed on , 15 years ago .
oh , they 're my family .
it 's that balance of opposites that 's the nugget of flam .
walt would get a little irish courage in him , he 'd get into it with harlan .
oh my god !
he wouldn 't leave him alone , the poor guy . harlan finally had to give him the hook .
no . allowance as a motive ? again , more weak sauce .
granted . but she lied to me .
three ?
i see where you are going with this .
but that night something harlan said shook him .
i wonder ...
can i wait inside ? i feel like i shouldn 't be here .
you have been very patient my friend .
this stuff is the best .
is there a problem ?
i messed up .
excuse me , but what is the good stuff 's dosage supposed to be ?
that 's much less . so what happens ?
well , no pressure .
so , if someone switched the meds on purpose , i 'd be dead in ten minutes .
yes , you 'll feel symptoms in five . sweats , disorientation , and then ...
yeah , from the moment of injection .
what are you thinking ?
let me guess .
stop . stop .
ransom . call me ransom . it 's my middle name .
okay , this is trooper wagner , i 'm lieutenant elliott .
excuse me . sir ?
you gonna run me in ? i don 't feel like talking . i 'm distraught .
all right , what is this ? what 's this arrangement ?
csi kfc ?
hey asshole . not her name , not her job .
he lives in fear .
jesus , i coulda killed him .
clarity .
and that felt ...
the old bastard .
what makes you think that ?
he wanted this for himself , he wanted this for the family .
you 've come this far . let me help you go all the way .
you could just turn me in right now and still get your cut of the inheritance . why ?
i can help you get away with this , and then ...
happy ending . everybody wins : you , me , harlan .
deal ?
marta .
hey , relax .
everything 's going crazy . are we rich ?
i don 't even know what that means but you better get your ass up .
oh my god marta . what is all this . what did you do ?
you didn 't get any other instructions , no phone call , no email , nothing ?
there is one .
you know what this means , right ?
oh no !
yeah .
okay , baby driver .
she basically told me where it was .
and i just handed it to you .
to be fair .
perhaps we deserve each other .
what i 'm about to say isn 't gonna be easy and you 're gonna be upset .
i ...
you have not been good to her .
you 're a pack of vultures at the feast .
well , you 're not getting bailed out , not this time .
what ?
what 's with all this drama ?
blanc . i told ransom , ransom told you , i 'm telling you now -
i spoke in the car about the hole at the center of this donut .
a donut hole in a donut 's hole .
and when we do , we see that the donut hole has a hole in its center .
blanc , look , i understand that this is amusing for you .
someone fishing for a crime to reverse the will , blanc .
so yes , the person must have known the contents of the will .
i submit harlan told you everything .
not a red dime or word of my work to a single one of them , you included .
harlan told him that i could beat him at go .
she told me , she has a cousin who works as a receptionist at the examiners office .
the numbers , they mean nothing to her ,
she didn 't . she sent it to ransom .
elation ! he still thinks marta has given harlan the tampered drugs !
he goes to the will reading in high spirits , ready to see the family tear itself apart ,
marta 's confession .
now he realizes that marta has committed no crime ,
unless ...
you 're not gonna give up the money .
it 's like kissing someone who 's drunk .
last chance . go .
this one is designed to blind ,
you scared the people , so they flee in this direction
we 'll have people enough time to rush in and help the wounded .
right .
i guess there are no rules anymore
we could use her to erode support .
you 've been underground a long time , madam coin .
then there 's no sacrifice is too great .
of course .
you have the habit of burying people before they are dead .
no , minister antonius .
yes , sir .
i 'm surprised they haven 't found you a new lung
is that why you hate me ?
you 're also a little hard to swallow .
even though it 's not an act .
feel free to take any of this personally .
but nobody likes me .
it 's just stuff my family brought .
and now we want you to rest
katiniss , we won 't let this momentum go to waste .
showing them that you 're alive .
1t will be like being on the front line .
i think they will understand why you 're not with them .
we 'll need you for the ceremony.you are very valuable to us .
i 'm not sure that kind of comment recommends you for the job either , soldier .
he 's going to try to kill me .
we 'll keep him contained .
one way or another this war is going to come to an end .
maybe she 's starting to see you as a threat .
but you 'll throw support to someone would it be her ?
than these propos can be done without you .
die .
i 'm planning for you to have a long life
what ?
you 're trying to decide whether or not you should kill me .
that 's not what i 'm doing .
in the first games
as an ally .
451 to base , over .
the peacemakers didn 't know where we were , they do now .
451 to base , come in .
451 to base , over .
but i can get us back to base . everdeen , give me the holo
what are you talking about ?
he transferred security clearance to her .
and why did he do that ?
to do what
she 's telling the truth.plutarch wants it televised .
simply a face plucked for the masses .
because you have no vision no true leader among you .
your soldiers are at each other 's throats .
just about every 10 steps .
so , we can 't go anywhere in the streets .
there might be another way .
he works sanitation down here .
real
at first , they all-they all blend together , but now
this choir it 's like they 're
you 're still trying to protect me , real or not real ?
what do all those deaths mean ?
there was no real life because we didn 't have any choice .
but if you kill him , katniss .
all those deaths they mean something .
she wanted you to be there and take care of her family and you did .
she really loves you .
she never kissed me like that
you gave up everything for her .
i doubt all 3 of us are going to make it out of this .
it 's her problem who to choose , right ?
mortar shells.it 's not ours
i 've invited you all here for several reasons , but first ...
i am taking the burden
exactly how long is that interim ?
but , it 's clear that people are far too emotional
but i 've called you here for a far more important vote .
this afternoon we will execute snow .
i 'm sorry so much burden fell on you .
but if i had to put you through it again
of course , we are fickle stupid beings
i 've secured you a ride out of the capital .
the country will find it 's peace .
what now ?
i couldn 't let you go without a proper goodbye .
okay . um , this could be our house .
we 'll think about it .
i drank a lot of tequila in college ... after
i have rounds , sir .
and do you know why we don 't have one , dr . bailey ?
oh , oh , chief , okay ,
ever since the shooting , we 've been in survival mode
that 's all the fight i have in me today .
mm . house hunting with my husband .
at least you 're calling him your husband .
hey , uh , do you know how long april and jackson are planning
well , aapril 's taken over lizzie 's room ,
i 'm not evil . it 's just ... she 's annoying .
really ? i find you much more annoying .
no , no , no , it 's not about izzie 's room .
april would like to start one .
what ?
peppy ovaries , too .
what ?
is this the same nothing
oh , okay , so " teeth " are code for what ?
usually the procedure is done using a cadaver bone ,
well , that 's why amputation 's less risky .
but this is done a lot ?
so if we do this , i mean , if we say yes ,
it 's a big risk , buddy .
what would you do ?
and i don 't think that i need to apologize for the fact
you 're making this about boobs ?
'cause they 're good boobs .
yes . go . hurry .
and the girl that was inside ?
oh , thank god .
i 'll talk to the police ,
what ?
he said he needed time to himself to think .
but i figured you 're used to it .
that only applies to medicine .
you are required to keep my secrets .
that 's lawyers .
god , this is creeping me out .
let 's just dig him up and get this over with .
bree ?
we 're gonna get through this , okay ?
if it turns out you are an alcoholic ,
oh , god , he brought jane ?

stephanie hagen
i mean , i don 't wanna show you up with my fancy sweats .
look , i think it 's sweet that you volunteered
so .. you have a son ? somebody married you ?
she was rich and wanted a child ,
uh , wait a minute . um , so ..
i 'm just a ... glorified babysitter .
as per school policy , we 're calling it an internship .
this looks like a cat , right :
you always go for easy costumes .
yes , but this year , tom 's new girlfriend
damn , why is there no chinese costume fluid ?
i have a friend in new york that is a costume designer ,
sadly , he 'll do anything for cash .
what ? why not ?
or , actually , in his glass .
really ? do you want me to speak to him ?
he said he met a great sponsor . he 's doing fine .
it 's kind of a miracle
this is gonna be a long day .
that 's original .
something more creative .
i 'd rather stick a knife in my eye .
37 . he 's always late .
please give candy .
i 'd rather stick a knife in my eye .
it 's just a couple hours .
that and a cigarette .
gaby , will you stop with the sanitizer ?
i can 't help it .
speaking of which ,
they 'll learn he 's my stepfather .
unless what ?
mom , i need my cat costume .
i 'm just putting on the finishing touches .
the ransom was two hours of trick-or-treating ,
score . check it out .
nice going , sweetie .
no , thanks , pal . what i want is to go .
okay , well , tell you what .
i 'm not interested in the relationship .
i mean , he 's not a novel you can just toss aside ,
he 's a person with feelings .
now ... let 's see if we can find something " fun size "
is it hot in here ?
okay .
you all right ?
this tightness in my throat .
uh , you sure you 're okay ?
no , no , no . i 'm fine , really .
how did you get in here ?
it 's a great hiding place , by the way .
mommy ?
well , you 'll have to ask jasper 's ...
yeah , it 's fine .
i will .
and you realized the error of your ways
look , i get you don 't like me . most people don 't .
oh . i think you care .
you have to understand , susan .
even before jasper ?
and i 'm gonna try to be a better dad .
i would never let that happen to me .
trick or ....
how 's dinner coming ?
didn 't you answer ?
when did you wake up ?
and you only listened to it now ?
should we follow her route to school ?
we could go to the park , ask her friends .
yes .
we 'll find her . we 'll find her .
it matches the suspect 's dna .
hello ?
step aside , please ! step aside .
this isn 't for a friendly game of poker .
it sounds kind of suspicious .
i told you , it won 't happen here .
20 seconds .
my wife was shot six months ago in a grocery
yes .
where is he ?
only three days left till the deadline runs out ,
coping with this difficult situation ?
it 's hard . i have nothing to say .
i think ..
i 'm sorry .
in the middle fast ...
they 're really going at it .
trace the call . he 's losing it .
fine , but we have to capitalize on it .
any guess on time of death ?
whoa ! oh ! he 's alive !
you guys stay here and process the scene .
push one mil adrenaline . let 's go .
call me if his condition worsens .
lia a
so he didn 't find any i.d. on the victim .
uh , burned brush and crushed vegetation
good thing he didn 't start the whole hillside on fire .
these tire tracks go onto the shoulder ,
so we have .... 18.5 milliamps .
but not enough to light him up
try missing a variable .
yeah !
oh , get this .
peaches ?
like , what a peach smells like .
no , you know what ?
looks like somebody else got the chair .
maybe we can pull surveillance .
now , wait a minute , now .
this one is actually dead .
right .
sounds like they don 't travel in the same circle .
but they do intersect
so maybe somebody 's picking out victims by street names .
found something interesting .
but exemplars from the soil at both crime scenes
i think i found our truck .
the storage facility across from the body dump
it was the only vehicle on the road at the time .
guy owns an appliance repair shop in north vegas .
hello .
we still on for tonight ?
we 're making some headway on the case ,
hey , that 's great about the headway .
do you think i could get a rain check for tonight ?
just call me when you can .
i won 't .
don 't let us interrupt your personal life .
you run a background on desmoot ?
probably no stranger to throwing a guy in a chair
i told you , i sold it , and i can 't find the paperwork .
but you got to cut your losses on this one , man .
she told you she was a teacher ,
and the term is " burlesque dancer . "
now , why 'd you go and do something like that ?
she told that she was just doing it for the extra money .
she lied to you , greg .
now , who is this-this reddenbacher dude ?
yeah , yeah . who is he again ?
what kind of bad news ?
he 's got a long history of psychiatric incarceration .
this just keeps getting better and better .
she might be in danger .
i 'm telling you .
yeah , yeah .
means he struggled for less time .
if it 's urgent , i can get her .
certainly .
they used some kind of conducting gel , as well
shots were fired , nobody was hit ,
that sounds a lot like greg
i tried , but he 's not picking up .
and why hasn 't he checked in with us ?
that 's used in the manufacture of paint .
the dunley paint company is within the radius
okay . ray , check it out with nick .
right .
this is king 3-2 ; we have shots fired !
just like his father .
remember me ? i ... i brought you a little something .
well , tell your mom i 'm here , and she can open it .
oh , well , tell your babysitter then .
mmm .
don 't apologize . you do good work .
should i get that ?
though she 's not as bad
and then i thought , maybe for a second ,
okay , good . i think they 're gone .
uh , yes . uh , well ...
he gave her roses and then more roses ,
just like his dad .
sadly , danielle doesn 't return his feelings .
say no more . she 's out of his league .
oh , eddie , i wish you had told me
i wouldn 't have said that ,
nerdy freak wants to date popular cheerleader ?
yeah , well , tell danielle she can relax .
oh , eddie , danielle would be happy to talk to you .
i don 't want a friend . i want someone to love me .
i think i , uh ,
you just have to be patient .
i feel like i 'm waiting
this is , like , the nicest thing anybody 's ever done for me .
why not ?
i mean , she ... she ... she thinks this whole art thing is stupid .
i ... i don 't think you should talk to your son that way .
huh ? what is he , your pet project ?
and then you let him play your stupid games
i 've got your number .
i 'll buy you some more while i 'm out .
no . and stay out of there .
you are so sweet to remember this . thank you .

the new hunger is a very powerful thing
i 'm sorry , i just can 't help it .
the part that makes me feel human again .
i don 't want to hurt you .
to feel a little better
i think i love you too , julie .
my mom used to say that it looked like
not after you told her you ate her ex .

i 'm gonna stop thinking so much .
i 'm gonna .. oh , shit , am i cold ?

what are you doing here ?
i 'm not sure , but it 's not good .
we don 't know why ,
dad , it 's important .
that does sound crazy .
i don 't know . they 're somehow curing themselves .
i saw it . it is really happening .
what 's happening is every day
we 're their food source .
they don 't eat broccoli .
okay ? so i want you to wake up !
they wanna help .
no . things don 't get better . things get worse .
that 's what happened to your mother ,

maybe he will pay you . that would be nice for a change .
could you hold it for a second ?
your father is one of germany 's most conservative priests

to call satire that mocks the nobility ' harmless ' is unfortunate .
i am not inclined to put anyone in prison for a poem about
he will not leave us alone till we respond .
extensive acreage which is a forest area ...
... cannot allow primitive pirates to humiliate our fleet .
what is it ?

her majesty has delivered a daughter . she is receiving shortly .

there 's no way around it . we have to reinstate censorship .
it 's spreading ! johann , we have to ...

the king wants to pardon you and brandt on the day of execution .
it seems you 're saved .
wants something in return .
and that you sincerely ask for god 's forgiveness .
the cabinet will later publish .
these past few days .
that doesn 't surprise me , son .
the execution isn 't today ?
it 's been noisy outside all morning . where are they all headed ?

i have no idea what it 's gonna cost to buy seattle grace ,
i 've got about ..
this is something that we made .
hunt sets a tone ,
it 's mine , but she 's gonna wake yours .

he was up there with us .
you 're gonna go after him ?
you know , i 'm sorry . i can 't help .
so , you know , good luck .
you 've been through something horrible
hey .
i did , an hour ago .
well , did you tell them to ring the bell ?
what do you think it is ?
we won 't know until we get more studies and open him up .
sorry .
you guys are both scrubbing in . i need all hands .
and someone tell russell that i 'm probably opening up
get this to path . get us an answer as quick as you can .
so i 'm , uh , willing to compromise .
okay , and let the other four things go ,
why the sudden need to be a homeowner , alex ?
because it 's my house . seriously , why now ?
and you need more space for that ?
i don 't want to be that guy .
i know . i gotta grow up a little .
you get that , right ?
and i 've known you a long time .
hmm ?
oh , dear .
oh , well ...
this is gonna be a mess .
this is stupid . i 'm calling it off .
not my problem .
it 's cancer .
i need you to be honest with me , please .
yeah , i did .
okay . get up . get dressed .
thoughtful ...
then he forced himself to ...
if i had known , i 'd have stopped him . i swear .
what 's the matter with you ?
oh , yes . that 's it . i have been walking around
no , i must lack the ability to wash myself
call leah , please . she is unbearable .
come with me now .
when russell 's stent tore through the guy 's aorta .
consult with russell first ?
russell doesn 't even know you yet .
you 'll be gone on your first day .
he 's probably going to fire you .
well , i think she does .
now what 's that gonna show ?
lemierre 's has markers ..
and she might have an i.j. thrombosis ,
yeah , it 's tricky , and we see it so seldom now ,
mm . i did .
you know as well as i do , i had no other choice but to ...
if you didn 't want me here ,
i had to go in on your aortic ulcer .
i grew up there , alex .
and you grew up there , too .
and you 're fine the way you are , and so is the house .
you can if you want , but i won 't .
we got a deal .
that 's not possible , linc .
i don 't know how you could have .
me . veronica and a bunch of reporters .
you don 't know that .
you don 't remember what he looks like . i do .
why would he come back now ,
why is he still alive ?
anonymously ?
lf you had taken care of him sooner ..
how do you know that ?
one more thing .
absolutely .
one is terrence steadman 's autopsy report .
the other paper is an operative report
that 's impossible . let me see this .
whoa , whoa , whoa , not so fast .
the hospital can tell you .
i checked .
oh , please . you 're preposterous .
i don 't know what these papers mean
that should give us more than enough time
yeah , but why not just tat up route 66 ?
you saying you found another way ?
what do you mean , maybe ?
but it 's suicide .
you know what they say about weather in the midwest ,
it 's just the in-between that 's gonna have to change .
we 're already through that room beneath the infirmary .
there 's a reason they replaced it
the only way we 're getting into that infirmary
the psych ward ?
and there 's a subsurface line
oh , whoa , whoa . what do you mean " sort of " ?
about 40 yards up route 66 , there 's a grate and
we gotta do it above ground .
sure thing .
yeah , how about saving the small talk , old head ,
write them here and then send them to a pal in iraq
a con pretending he ain 't in the hole to his family .
yeah , you the one to talk .
now you listen ,
a daughter .
yeah , what do you know ?
because if a crazy steps out of line ,
down the hall , through the door , make a right .
what you doing down here ?
i told you i didn 't burn him .
he was acting kind of weird when we lined up for final count .
but he 's not a big talker anyway ,
my ass .
i didn 't touch him .
it was an accident .
hey , slim !
there 's been a bit of a problem , boss .
i left the iron on it too long .
my new shirt 's coming out of your kick .
tell you what ?
trust me , primo . the less you know , the better .
i 'm sorry ..
that 's him .
as soon as .. i find out .
in your heart , you are a really good man .
there are like six big buildings over there .
that 's why it 's called canvassing .
you tell self to go down a few floors ,
ma 'am , i need to see him
talk to angela down the hall .
i 'm sure it is .
averaging 30 miles an hour the whole way ,
he 's got to be mobile
no permanent address , so we 're looking for hotels , right ?
i 'm sorry , cole . i can 't leave the desk right now .
may i help you ?
and this man just came into a $ 100,000 inheritance .
oh , my gosh . what , $ 10,000 :
okay , so if you do see him , would you please give us a call ?
well , your commencement check 's sitting on my desk
before you say another word ...
or so the legend goes .
done .
if you could .
he 'll be right with you .
some one 's in there .
you can do it manually .
the finance minister 's anxiously awaiting your arrival .
pretty sure i can handle laos .
i 'm well aware of your resume , griffin .
we 're in .
where the death toll has risen over 200 .
i 'm aware of our final objective . general .
i need to make sure that everyone knows his role .
why did you take today of all days to come down here
today we got confirmation
i thought that was because she was married to that turk .
what is it then ?
it looked like you could barely choke it down .
excuse us .
oh . this was a pleasure .
what i don 't understand is why ?
in-in energy , and logistics ,
and then they profit by rebuilding it .
i was at a bar earlier .
how do you know ?
how do you know your source is telling the truth ?
so this source , what does he need you for ?
he 's part of the intelligence community .
and he needs you to help him .
i can help you .
but i didn 't , did i ?
my family weren 't supposed to be on that flight .
but i didn 't .
because i didn 't want to .
all right .
your breathing as the bass .
your heart as the drums .
put another one in . never less than two .
you hit someone in the sternum with that ,
shoot me .
right here .
shut up . just do it .
your breathing as the bass .
even though he says he was friends with caleb .
you saw the photograph .
what if he has the ptsd
did you take that into account ?
did you take that into account ?
your parents are fighting about me .
you look like you got hit or something
yeah .
hi , great , okay .
i 'm gonna have a beer before dinner . can i offer you one ?
and dinner is gonna be ready in an hour .
are you helping him with his homework ?
hey , don 't go . stick around , be sociable .
okay . suit yourself .
and that 's okay . i mean , it 's okay .
she wonders if i 'm ever ,
that 's my drink of choice . let me get one of those .
that seems like a shame to me .
are you serious ? iam , yes .
do i look like i 'd like to buy something for their fellas ?
sure , okay , fine .
mister , i don 't know what you 're going for ,
you keep the change on that .
are you , like , rich ?
he doesn 't need to be in costume
thank you .
cool
a gang of high school kids came in here
you didn 't really get a good look at the other guys .
i mean ,
luke ! what happened ?
are you okay ? yeah , i 'm fine .
why were they picking on you ?
yes , ma 'am , he 's fine .
no , no one saw . it 's just the usual high school stuff , you know .
yeah , he 's .
well , you can set them right here .
craig , no .
it 's old stuff
i mean , he doesn 't even have a job .
okay . he 's not a drug dealer .

i 'm sure you 're familiar with it .
but this baby , this here is
you army ?
i 'm navy , myself .
there was no forced entries
i don 't know what that means .
i don 't know .
yeah . as soon as corporate found out , they called me .
and they 're offering me allan 's salary
i called the army base that david said that he was from .
he was in some military hospital in arizona .
about 20 people died , david collins was one of them .
i 've never seen him use a wallet
your brother knows computers .
do you want some advice , luke ?
never let anyone pick on you .
those kids at school , they 're bigger than you ?
if they take it off of you and beat you up ,
yeah . okay .
you 're giving this to me ?
except he 's not a doctor anymore .
so , david knows the guy ? i mean , maybe it 's his uncle or something .
i need to talk to the police .
so , what do you need me to do ?
do you really think david killed craig and that other guy ?
leonard i 'm no expert here , but i believe in the context of a luncheon invitation ,
uh ... yes .
great .
oh , yeah . a lot of people think i 'm a water sign . penny :
and the occasional steak . i love steak !
well , uh , do you have some sort of a job ?
oh ... . i love cheesecake .
you want to know the most pathetic part ?
is that crazy ?
no , it 's not crazy .
paradoxes are pant of nature .
i 'm just trying to be a good neighbor .
that 's not to say that if a carnal relationship were to develop that i wouldn 't participate .
do you think this possibility will be helped or hindered
luke skywalker 's the conditioner .
it 's fantastic , unbelievable .
it 's a stephen hawking lecture from mit in 1974 .
it 's before he became a creepy computer voice . leonard :
it 's just not a good time .
ah , yes . well , that may be the proximal cause of our journey ,
you think with your penis .
and you didn 't have to come .
why can 't she get her own tv ?
i broke up with joyce kim .
to mend her broken heart .
her ex-boyfriend as to who gets custody of the t .
so we get to have a scene with him ?
mommy , daddy is angry with me again .
please forgive me , mommy .
yes , i do .
all right , sis . i 'm sorry .
aunt donna .

actually , i 've told glenn , my boyfriend , to buy you a new one .
thank you , my dear .
of course he is . he 'll come straight here after shooting .
then i can buy a football game .
it 's very expensive . i don 't want to burden her .
ask for it ?
she will abduct a child that wants to go with her .
children who don 't obey their parents .
those children will take the place of her child
i heard that , mom .
all right , i 'll be going now , okay ?
mom , please don 't leave me for too long , okay ?
if i miss you , can i sleep in your room ?
you absolutely can .

the mirror is ...

i will never leave my children .
do you want to come with me ?
dinda ...
dinda , help me .
kresna , come here !
i 'm sure there 's a clue on this mirror .

... for her new makeup line , and she 's gonna sing
... " give me love and stuff . "
thank you so much for doing this , ronaldo .
they 'll believe you because of your clothes .
okay .
um , uh , do you think that there 's any way
this is ronaldo .

yeah .
hey , lovers and stuffers . it 's your girl , kimmy .
well , that 's the first time i 've slow-cooked ribs for a showing .

maybe we should see some more houses ?
what do you mean , " of course not " ?
honey , take the win .
why would you want to get married right now ?
i was getting a battery for my watch .
i run a unit that weeds out crooked cops like him .
we 're a small division .
i have evidence .
rama ,
i can provide safety for your wife and child .
right now ,
and the police are being bribed at his office so no one knows .
need evidence that deza
he 's serving time in prison .
meaning
oul can 't know where i am
lease understand
i heard he was discharged .
if we 're talking earning credibility ,
if you really want me to beat him up ,
for bejo .
where is he ?
which one is benny ?
now while i 'm in here , benny and his associates are with me .
you 'll figure that out at some point .
i 'm my father 's son .
all i can do is use that to protect myself .
it would make my job a lot easier if you 'd cool things down here .
you can do that yourself .
he wants to greet you personally .
yeah , he does .
do you know of a man goes by the name bejo ?
half-arab kid , made a name for himself when he took out yudi 's group .
owns a few restaurants ,
i know him , came to me way back
where ?
now , it 's like this :
but it 's not a free pass with me .
and we 'll make sure you 're looked after while you 're here .
if you fuck up , you 're out .
so this is your place .
anything else ,
i hope that 's not where our similarities end .
be ready at 7 : 00 .
what happened ? we lost you .
are you kidding me ? you 're fresh out of prison , they wouldn 't .
do they know ?
don 't play games with me , no more surprises .
where are you ?
i don 't want you or your team within a mile of this place .
i 'm fucking serious , you could have gotten me killed .
okay .
yeah
we could go in smiling or storm in shooting .
these people are reckless , they don 't have their shit together .
focus . don 't let your mind drift .
sorry . can i help you with anything else ?
this isn 't enough .
but i counted it myself . it 's exact .
just like always .
take a seat .
it hurts . it 's too big .
the time i 've known him , he speaks nothing but highly of you .
but i know what my gut tells me
if you see anything weird , you tell me .
do you think he wants to explain to them that this is his father ?
but i haven 't seen him since he was ... " yeah , and whose choice was that
there are millions of fathers in the world supporting their families .
do you even realize that what you do is so fucking disgusting ?
what 's wrong ?
your father 's right .
well , you 've grown all of a sudden .
look where it got you ? it got you a fucking penthouse suite that i pay for .
shut the fuck up !
" ou think you know my father ?
we only owed you and we paid it back .
what ? did you expect more ?
did we get the okay ? fuck the okay .
what do you mean , you can 't ? what have i not witnessed ?
corruption .
you think you 're alone in this ? this isn 't your show .
i can 't hold back bangun anymore
everything was for you ! and you brought it to the ground .
and for what
come on , tell me .
i know who you are .
i told you before ...
i hope ..
i don 't care what they say .
so , i knew that the data from our online activity
these digital traces of ourselves
but we were so in love
all of my interactions ,
and this is true for each and every one of us .
go back to washington .
how did the dream of the connected world tear us apart ?
uh , every app is carefully scrutinized before ins .. being installed , and
hey .
but it wasn 't until after the 2016 election that i realized
the worst-case scenario has happened with technology .
and the question i kept asking myself was :
when project alamo was at its peak ,
they would kind of congregate here .
but what we also learned
cambridge analytica was here .
this was the data center .
how would they know that ..
paul
okay . let me just , uh , set up my screen .
both paul and i understood that
but it was invisible .
that 's the hardest part . um ...
and if it was true ,
thank you .
we could see the path to being a billion-dollar company .
i 've been investigating cambridge analytica
so , andy , he was just like sort of , like , showing me all the photos on his phone .
we had such a good time . oh , donald .. "
steve bannon headed the campaign for trump .
now , i would like to think , in my own little way ,
and he was like . and he was like , " it 's creepy , carole ! " he said ,
the brexit work .
it 's a process of coming to terms with what you 've created
but there 's been a lot of attention on me because i 'm sort of .. i 've become the ..
come forward and put my name to it .
who 's brittany kaiser ?
the wealthiest companies are technology companies .
and the reason why these companies
and these companies are valuable
and i thought , " no . ,
it 's a moment where people have that visceral sense .
and so , i 've dropped pretty much everything i was doing
how are we actually going to message voters so that they can under ..
and the answers to that will help inform our policy and our communications ,
her to share what is some reasonably explosive materials
and we 're still just scratching the surface .
tell us about the first meeting you had in trump tower .
and i asked corey , why could this place possibly look so familiar ?
that 's probably why you recognize it . " and .
the trump campaign ho is a reality tv set .
people that i used to disagree with a lot ,
it was important . it is important .
i am about to draft some questions for a senator
exactly .
yeah , lit is . um , lit ..
we always spend the majority amount of money
okay . not at all .
and that was when i discovered this video
and i was like , well , here ook , it 's brittany kaiser !
and i was like , well , hele. ook , it 's briittany kaiser !
she works for cambridge analytica .
like , what the fuck ?
i 've gotta get out of here !
get a hold of yourself !
there was like a whole stream of people going , " don 't be so hysterical ! "
it was like , " calm down ! calm down ! "
the day after that leave.eu video was put out ,
i 'm really happy to be back ,
so fire door number one ?
so many people were so angry that i was working on the brexit campaign ,
more news on facebook over the weekend
it 's today 's ft .
about a month ago , we heard new reports that suggested that wasn 't true .
blame it on me , mark . go for lit .
thank you for having me here today , and i 'm ready to take your questions .
were facebook employees involved in that ?
yes , they were .
oh , my god .
always . forever .
i 've got much more than that ,
i went through most of it . i 'll look through more of it today .
oh , and the brexit campaign , yeah .
oops , we won !
look , um ...
i know already that she is a complicated person , uh ,
i believe in redemption .
uh , i 'm an idealist . i think we can fix stuff that 's broken ,
good morning , welcome to this further session
now , there was a contact between facebook and cambridge analytica
so that seems strange to me .
what was the nature of the work that you had done so sar
so , i think you 've been quite clear , as far as you 're concerned ,
just to clarify , for our benefit ,
lock her up ! lock her up !
what was it like for you to watch the channel 4 undercover video ?
when we watched that video .... .
and we knew it was coming out .
in a state of shock .
tonight , an undercover interview by channel 4 news in london
this technology is going on unabated and will continue to go on .
in some senses . i feel that , um ..
it just sucks for me it was cambridge analytica .
my question is for carole cadwalladr from the guardian .
this is not a partisan issue , i cannot say that more strongly .
it 's about our national sovereignty .
one thing we do know is that facebook has been obstructive iin its efforts
well , i ... they have with me .
hi , how are you ?
facebook is designed to monopolize attention .
you know , slot machines and the like .
and so , they created a set of tools
and once everybody has their own reality , it 's relatively easy to manipulate them .
it is a lot easier to just sort of say , " i 'm not gonna think about it . "
for me , this was one of those moments .
because my fingerprints are on this thing .
and i just want to be able to ..
one of the things that i was really struck by was ..
uh , none of them ever wanted to offer to pay me .
your family lost their money in 2008 ?
we lost our family home in 2014 , when i started working for cambridge .
the last time i was in london ,
now , to be back here and , uh .... .
the villain is up against the wall .
i don 't think that curiosity is indicative of anything nefarious .
i didn 't discuss the us election !
paul !
there 's evidence that russian intelligence created fake black lives matter memes .
the kkk has infiltrated police
at the same time , they were setting up pages
hey , uh , who 's .. wh-who 's this ?
you 're the one calling me .
i 'm looking for beth . is she there ?
hi , you 've reached beth . you know what to do .
um ... i just called your phone ,
i 'm hungry .
people change . we 're in college .
it 's just i don 't know where she is . that 's never been the case before .
so .. any help you can give me .
okay , i do what any other person my age does .
work hard . beth ?
she ... . is doing shit that i 'm not into .
i 'm just tired
i can 't believe i got myself into this shit . oh , my god .
this is ridiculous
i don 't know why you won 't let me just , like , text the guy .
like , we could stay in a really nice place ...
who are you ?
but , uh , there is a club across the street ,
they 're not going anywhere . only one that 's leaving is you .
i have no interest whatsoever in what your business is .
in fact , the less we know about each other ,
and neither of us are leaving this table until you tell me .
hey , why don 't you girls , uh .. take off , huh ?
come on , let 's go !
you know how kids are these days .
he 's not a bad kid
no , i can 't say i do .
i told you to put your best people on it .
the guys at the bar aren 't talking .
that 's all we know
people that have limbs that are amputated
every time i look , i mean
right now .
you 're gonna be okay .
i just .
one second , i 'm at a college party .
i need some answers !
what do you want ?
what do you have in here ? what do you want ?
i don 't want anything !

and , of course , i took the next one after that ,
i did something 20 years ago for these ..
and i will get you out of here .
thank you .
i 'm gonna drop you off with a friend ,
okay , you 're leaving me where , exactly ?
what do you want , faul ?

we were trying to buy the stupid hospital .

so how are you settling in ? are you settling in ?

it just goes to show you , that the yukon is the only place
i must really like you

he put that in the sky when he could have put it in your back .
he 's doing a hell of a job .

good girl .
i told you .

i think you did it for me .
animals are going to get to him , you leave him outside .
don 't look like he got a lot of walk left in him .
you 're supposed to make jokes about funny things .
your brain 's been mixing in with the sawdust .
not that seed of bark shite , the good stuff .
you can pay me back later , huh ?
now boat captains think like i do .
we 're going to be buried here and that 's a fact .
take the scenic route to get where you 're going , don 't you ?
might .
only one of it 's kind so far .
folks around here they 're hungry for gold .
a good deal of money will be invested in ignorance ,
sell it when ic 's hot ?
and i will pay for your boat fare out of here .
or maybe you want gold ,
listen to me
you 're the funny one , aren 't you ?
easy now .
you 're not getting rid of me that easily !

future 's wanton , it 's the present hour that counts .
hey , the man of the moment .
how so ?
yeah .

my friend dies and suddenly you own his half of the claim .

you should take soap 's offer .
you write your mother , haskell ?
the world 's divided between men who write their mothers ,
i killed my ma .

killing of your friend is the talk of dawson .
mortician pulled this out of him .
big bore .
45 / 70 sharps maybe .
pusslam jraders , seecers on the coast .
and what motivation the tlingit have in killing
they think the land is theirs .
they 've apparently got an invisible boundary beyond
the second we staked our claim we were marked men .
heard you 're heading to the tlingit camp ,
i don 't need someone to come along just to fill their notebook .
it 'd be a lot easier to find if you have someone
yes , ma 'am .
has he got it in him to kill like he says ?

all right , dr. torres .
this is your career at seattle grace .
dr. gracie didn 't like your infectious process idea ,
is " ass " the word of the day ?
you hang me out to dry like that in front of the chief again ,

we re not allowed to beat you with sticks .
you accused a patient in my hospital
he 's threatening to sue us for slander . good job .
both of you .
you need to start to wrap up . wrap up ? i just got started .
because i 'm trying to be meticulous ,

appendicitis .

shake it off .
i mean , we were done .
i put in the n.g. tube , doctor .
dr. grey. looking beautiful as usual .
no one knows what 's causing it or how it spreads .

that 's what this procedure will tell us .
he kicks like you wouldn 't believe .

there .
could be any number of things .
let 's not worry until we have to .
we 'll have to remove most of the colon
more suture . and what 's with these damn lights in here ?

no one gets fat like this so fast . i told him .
i really like you , olivia .

my ophthalmologist tells me i 'm just getting older ...
i 'll set up some tests :
let 's just keep this to ourselves .

you know , i have spent hours , days , years ,
i think he 's gonna cry .
is this a better time ?
i just wanted to remind you
you have to understand .
our residents really respond to these events .
i think it 's important you attend .
i mean , we never said , " we have rules , "
you 're a handful enough as it is ,
you see ? there 's nothing to worry about .
we should .
just for the record ...
i bet you do .
i just need to sew up the perforation on the bladder wall .
well , you said this man 's wife is pregnant ?
it is .. they 're what hold back the urine and the feces .
it 'll only make you feel worse .
you should know i had nothing to do with that .
i mean , that 's what 's important .
yeah . you know , it 's like when stan lee and steve ditko
even though stan lee gets to be in all the marvel movies .
and he 's a household name , you know ?
that 's not helping .
stuart , we 're here .
yeah , well , i tried putting him out on the curb ,

let 's get started .
should we tell everyone not to come ?
okay . well , i 'll keep it together if you can .
i 'm not making any promises !

i mean , you need to get out of town , clear your head .
my parents would never let me do that .
and i already took his car , so ...
i don 't know . i don 't think that 's a good idea , because ..

you wouldn 't believe how he 's getting the girls in line .
by the way , big oil stain in the garage ?
it 's gone !
hey , i , uh , i need to talk to you about ben .
he 's in the hospital .
what happened ?
he started having chest pains .
but ben 's a young guy . he 's healthy .
oh , he 's been under a lot of stress .
what was that for ?
i was able to hit the entire left side of the mall .
hi , mom .
the girls and i tackled that dead tree out back .
the older one is pretty good with an ax .
well , i can 't thank you enough .
for the next 16 days .
i 'm thinking about begging karen to take me back .
i really miss her .
i mean , what 's there to miss ?
yeah , she can be a little gruff .
but today , when i was telling the girls
i ... think you just need to get your mind off her .
a nice , long bath .
come on . you can , uh , use my lavender bath salts .
that reminds me of a funny story .
okay , into the bath . chop chop .
no , it 's for roy , kind of a peace offering .
i 've only lived with the guy for one day ,
i have to clear the air about a few things .
why not ? is he still angry ?
yeah , he took an ax to a tree in my backyard .
really ?
okay .
well , can you give this to him anyhow ?
i will make sure he gets it .
make this disappear .
you okay ?
well , you look like crap .
mike told me you borrowed money from a oan shark .
you want to help me ?
this time as the kind of man you deserve .
that 's terrific .
and if we 're getting back together ,
yeah .
is there a better way to wake up from a nap
these are for the girls .
yes . i 've been doing some thinking ,
but you also have a good head ,

you two will come out of this stronger than ever .
at my age , falling in love
i thought ...
but i-i guess i was wrong .
the cancer is back .
she knew what she was doing was wrong .
she knew the risks if people found out .
hi . i 'm tanya .
i 'm all yours for the next hour .
show me your jugs .
oh , you want a private session with tanya .
she doesn 't work for me anymore .
i forgot that french restaurant was so formal .

no one goes that long without a few bumps in the road .
i didn 't realize you were still here .

okay , ladies , please .
i will never forgive you for this !
oh , you like my ring ?
oh , my god , my nose !

no , we 're trained for disasters .
i 'm sure no one will notice .
okay , the break is near the femoral artery .
um , yeah .
i 'm trying .

damn it . damn it . damn it .
i run a respectable o.r. clamp .
good news .

parker will never sign off on this surgery .
he 's making you conventional and skittish .

the repair worked , so why put her in danger
i spend very little time thinking about him .
meredith , i 'm not gonna potty train your kid .

yeah .
a month ago , this would 've been someone else 's decision .
you need to take dr. thomas off probation .
why would i ?
oh , because he 's old ?

look , i know you 're in an awkward position ,
but he 's holding you back .

flora 's time has come .
l can feel the cold .
flora needs help .

no , no , no , no.i am not gonna lose my cookbook career over this .
hand me that torch .
you don 't ?
the vinegar had to be substituted for the sherry
come on.andrew 's not clever enough to pull that off .
well , then who do you think did it ?
at least smart enough to get an mba .
she thinks it 's a couple of truck payments .
this would really hurt her .
and i can 't let that happen .
can 't wait .
all that matters is that one hour from now ,
i will explain it all away ,
millions of girls out there would do anything
tired of the constant pressure .
i 'mtired of airplane food .
lt felt good to butcher him , cidnt it ?

that 's a good idea . i mean , i got all my best friends here .
uh. hey , honey ?
excuse me , young lady ?
sophie wouldn 't want me hanging around the apartment in my bathrobe .
i , uh , obviously misread you guys .
so , what do you guys want me to do ?
save your energy . it 's gonna be a big night for you tonight .

especially sophie . you can 't do it .
thanks to you .
omne more time .
billy !
hey , hey , you stay out of this , all right ? it has nothing to do with you .
i owe you this one .
he likes you . i know he likes you a whole lot ,
he 's my best friend . i can 't let him marry you .
i guess we gotta talk , huh ?
that she 's young , got her whole life ahead of her .
i 'm sorry , i didn 't catch your names .
no , you did it right . you , uh ... congratulations , a good job .
no . no , you were right .
no , paddy . i .. i 'm old
i 'm just scared of being old
my brain cannot conceive how old this body is .
so how did she take it
poor kid . are those for me ?
i 'm sorry , um .
anything until i 'm connected to the satellite .
okay , great .
shut down the fuel pump .
they were identified as low level chechen separatist .
by enabling acts of terror in nations friendly to western interests .
imf would be right .
because , we , are the syndicate mr. hunt .
your mission , should you choose to accept it ,
i can neither confirm nor deny details of any operation .
in fact , until this panel appoints a new secretary ,
mr. chairman , the so call impossible missions force
some guy break different than others .
he 'll die , before you turn him .
you should go , before it gets ugly .
you should go .
look at the photographs , dunn .
all of them were government agents .
these are highly classified files and yet hunt had no problem collecting them .
i wonder how ?
that thought had cross my mind .
i had decrypted , processed , passed more data than anyone in my section .
and you ask me the same question , just in a different way .
you seem to thinks i have some kind of obligation to him .
ethan hunt is still out there in the field , and i 'm stuck here answering for it
welcome to vienna , benjl . missed me ?
no act. you know what ? please , don 't tell me that ,
for your safe , we shouldn 't be seen together .
what i do know , is he 's our only possible link to the syndicate
are you in ?
so , what 's the play ? simple . you find him , we tag him .
because as you stated earlier ,
right .
okay .
lights ready . act one preset .
but to the cia , that is actionable intelligence .
and he 's the one with the actionable intelligence .
the special activity division will now have full discretion .
whether hunt lives or dies . it 's entirely up to him .
there 's a change of clothes in that bag , right there .
once you 're there , you 'll have to inform on me .
tell the truth .
missing , presumed dead .
this one too .
let me guess . presumed dead .
i was looking for him in bosporus .
he slipped away again in jakarta .
i just missed him in the fphilippines .
you 're saying these accidents are somehow connected .
that fire bank corrupted a global arms cooperation .
these are no accidents .
a rogue nation .
destroy the system that created them .
an anti-tm t
or they could just be a series of random disasters .
just like he was there tonight . i 'm sure of it .
how he 's funded
let me help you find him . that 's why i brought you here .
huntley 's handed this over to special activities division .
that 's where you come in .
okay . look , luther .
all i know about you is that you chose to work for hunley .
man , you don 't have to worry about ethan .
this is the cia , this is hunley we 're talking about .
they 're going to kill ethan . they 're going to kill beni .
you need to understand something
alright .
okay .
so that the other one can access the computer without being caught .
can i get in through there .
seawater flows through the intake .
if any metal enters the intake .
swim from the intake to the service hatch .
well . then , you just have to hold your breath for 2 minutes .
so , i have to hold my breath for 3 minutes ?
but i think you 're overlooking , is the physical exertion .
don 't worry about him . alright .
you said it yourself , it 's the only way
i 'm not even looking for them . i 'm looking for her .
these sketches , what do you see ?
but this woman , he knows her .
i 'm betting that if he 's not already with her , he 's on his way .
tell me it 's possible to pull facial recognition of a sketch .
i knew we 'll get it .
i appreciate everything you do for me , but .
we got it .
i thought you said you can find him ?
well , if we 're being honest ,
method is. far more surgical .
i helped my government killed many innocent people and more , so much more .
recruit former agents from other nations. supply them with a new identity
i rejected the proposal unequivocally .
prime minister , there is no any syndicate .
a specialist without equal , immune to any counter measures .
no person he cannot become .
sir . hunt is the living manifestation of destiny .
prime minister .
2 pounds semtex , 530 caliber ball bearings .
so , no sudden moves .
when lane has what he wants , i kill you and benji .
no time to think , ethan . have a seat , please .
from the moment i killed the young lady in the record shop ,
i also knew tlsa wouldn 't have a choice
you were certain we would end up where we are .... . right now .
so was i
human life didn 't matter anymore , or maybe it never really did .
or why .
i didn 't write anything on the web site to you or anybody else .
yeah , a couple feds staking it out across the street .
maybe you missed the part about the feds .
to not get my $ 5 million !
well , then get that little college boy brain of yours to work then .
he 's got maricruz locked away somewhere .
yeah ,
michael , i 'm , i 'm in no position to ask you for anything .
i asked you a question .
all right , you get your $ 5 million .
win , win , win .
the witness is only unavailable
your honor ..
the state 's objection will be noted in the record .
it doesn 't make a difference if you 're guilty or innocent .
you 're not that guy .
i am that guy now , michael .
the only reason i 'm not five miles away from here right now is
believe me , i understand the impulse to pull the trigger .
never heard of it .
that 's great .
i was wondering you had
well , excuse me for thinking i could ask for a little help from some fellow americans .
hello , boys .
looked almost professional .
what 's it worth to you to find out ?
okay . tell me what you know .
without the money .
and there 's a way out , believe me .
entire ... my entire adult life ,

so i 'm going to spell out the present options .
well , i got my answer .

the only thing threatening that dog was you !
like it wasn 't my fault .
these kinds of problems are hard to overcome ,
kaylie , i 'm sorry .

well , actually , we are going to need you to vote " yes " on this one .
you want me to vote on the environmentalists ' side ?
this is about you and how you look to voters .
so if you come across as more centrist ,
then we 'll get precisely what we always wanted anyway , won 't we ?
just back your punk ass up .
and i believe he 's in danger of a psychotic break .
clean him up .
put it down . you 're not a killer .
don 't move !
so , bree , i 've planned a few events myself back in chicago .

his bartender and his breath corroborate his story .
yes , sir .
mr. raymond , a cup of coffee .
if you don 't mind ..
as a doctor , i 've diagnosed hundred of patients
for 2 whole years , all i could do is go to the hospital every single day
and that was tha .
i do understand something about fate , mrs. ellis .
i .. just want to know why your son was killed .
and then , perhaps , it can help me catch the man ..
dr. clancy . fax for you . it 's marked urgent .
mental illness likely .
mercurial or an artistic temperament .
this isn 't even close to our guy .
john
maybe we can 't catch this guy . maybe ..
and i think it 's a good one . i want you to see it .
you know , something bad is going to happen .
so , we had trouble tracking that down .
i 'm a painter .
can i lock up first ?
frogs .
suspect is armed and dangerous .
agent , can you give us a visual description .
we will when we can .
i need a number .
have so much stuff to do
you were always a lousy driver .
i wanted him to take after his dad
and then we get it
well , you did a hell of a lot with your life and time .
the killer may have known the people were sick when no one else did
anything you come across . okay ?
of course . that 's what it means , " congratulations , partner . "
well , i 'm the youngest partner in the firm 's history .
i don 't know , i mean ... they bring me on .... . on monday ?

conflicted .
yeah , but not anymore . oh , no .
i don 't know if you 've ever known anyone who was dying , charles .

well , it is .. kind of precious , i guess .
is that how your daughter felt ?
her pain was " beautiful ? "
sit down and shut up .
i have no interest in fame or power .
don 't stop .
but we don 't always get to choose what we are .
it hurts so bad .
you 've seen it , too , right ? you 've heard it ?
except something 's not right .
captain , this is agent cowles . our suspect is headed into ashland station .
we 're gonna set up shop at a station up ahead .
the hybrid dog and octopus .

and he says he 's not gonna stop .
what the hell ?
i have pain radiating from my navel
sheldon , this is ridiculous .
please look at me when you 're talking to me .
no , you 're not .
you cannot exist as a virtual presence .
oh , good god .
at the hands of your roommate ?
that 's how i 'm going to make it look .
fine , but don 't expect my help .
i quit !
you were mauled by a prehistoric lake monster .
none . because they 're all dead !
what is wrong with you ? i 'm a human being !
but that creature , on the other hand ,
it 's no wonder you can 't keep anyone around .
i 'll make absolutely sure you don 't get eaten again . i promise .
if i 'm ever to be taken seriously by the adventuring community ,
they 're .. they 're my kind .
and then ..
can you just take me there ?
take you to the himalayas ?
yes , you can . if anyone can , it 's you .
mm , that 's a tantalizing proposition , i 'll admit .
um , my name depends upon it .
well , i 'm not very comfortable stealing a man 's clothes .
it 's indecent .
it just seems a little .
is it hot in here ? i think i need some air .
yeah . i 'm the same way . probably because my cave smells like sh ...
try not to shed on the cashmere .
so , let me see if i understand .
and to do this , you need the map
is this .... everything that you are here to say to me ?
he was your friend .
and you did not even go to his funeral .
you and aldous .. what happened to you ?
it was over between us , lionel .
yes , how fortunate for you both .
there , there , adelina .
it saddens me to see you shut away in this old house ,
you were always such a .
i ... i see how much your husband 's legacy means to you .
no . i will pay you for it .
come along , mr. link .
we aren 't gonna break in , are we ?
oh , please , mr. link . this is america .
hey , sir lionel . sorry .
i think i put a run in it .
we 're not here to perform burlesque .
here . now throw this rope over the wall .
uh , what do you mean ? i threw the rope over the wall .
well , you never said that . i 'm very literal .
we really don 't have time for this .
please , adelina . what possible need could you have for this ?
it is time for this unhappy bird ..
aldous learned of a mountain guide named gamu
yes , and then , mr. link ,
growl a little bit in excitement ?
you know , i really didn 't think it was possible .
i cannot believe it .
i wish ...
as soon as that ship reaches dry land ,
que es lo que quiere este ahora ?
eh . i don 't mind if i do .
my air ?
but mr. link ? i think perhaps his air is all stuffed up .
he really believes in you .
name one time that i 've ever treated him poorly .
you make him carry your bag like he 's your servant .
this is where it ends , frost .
look at you .
you 'll never be one of us .
you 've seen that ?
what ?
it 's places where the electricity 's gone out
i guess we 'll be takin ' our business someplace else .

penny , how much money do you have ?
hypnosis , drugs ...
he 'd just be like , " hey ! "
well , there is , like , this one psychologist ,
but it 's so expensive .
seems so .
fine .
but enough about me . let 's talk about you .
no , well , no story , really .
a french fry .
you are a very good blind person .
and the number from the door to the elevator .
otherwise you would be running into things all the time , ja ?
lucky for you , ' cause i 'd win .
please . thomas loves me .
like , i mean he 'll do whatever i want .
if you don 't have the stomach to take money
evidently , we must up the ante in this little game of ours .
all right , my babe .
ladies , i can explain .
my cousin 's got the blinds
and when i emerged , he was gone , my clothes were gone ,
you expect me to believe
because that 's the amount you stole from him .
that is what i 'm saying , tits for brains !
let me see ! let me see !
con artists make the best marks of all .
medusa . "
okay , yeah . thank you very much .
intros .
ritchie , slow down !
oh , shut it , doll .
okay , so here 's the story .
and i don 't just mean for real estate , nope .
she likes special furry friencs who are maybe , oh ,
it was a monastery or something ?
enjoy your meal .
i don 't speak to you for five years ,
i saw you in my bed this morning .
you role-play with me and i learn something about myself ?
seriously , you okay ?
this is not what i wanted .
but what is the point ? it doesn 't change anything .
do not make this another moment you will regret .
well , i 'd ask you about your fantasy again ,
ever since i was a kid , i wanted to enlist .
figured i 'd do some good , see some action .
no . there was an incident . got stuck behind a desk .
never enlisted ? what 's up with the dog tags ?
well , if you 're worried your fantasy sounds stupid ,
you got bullied ?
so when the most popular girl in school decided
that 's terrible .
sometimes he talked so much , i wanted to staple his mouth shut .
it was , like , an exercise .
yeah , i was branded " psycho stalker freak " for life .
i mean , obviously , the fantasy won 't be real ,
i 'd like to think that this is ... more exciting than riding a roller coaster .
i need to give ms. cole instructions .
you know , you can just say sorry .
he was talking to you .
you , sounds like you were a real ms. teen asshole 2009 back then .
and you . grow up .
revenge ain 't gonna fix you . only you can fix you .
never did right by her . i 'm gonna get you both off this island ,
go , go !
get out of here !
am i gonna be okay ?
you gotta save me , dude . i 'd do it for you .
i tried .
mom and dad love me more .
let 's go home .
i don 't love you anymore !
come on , let 's go find some ghosts ! run !
... i was never able to master the small fears .
i 'll change her for a quiet baby .
i 'll just finish my burger first .
good idea
you could 've changed her three hours ago .
say hello to queta , babe .
thank you .
thank you so much .
nah , man . she doesn 't work here anymore .
then i think she was going to new york for school or something
that 's just a piece of cheese .
but it comes from the moon .
... and your grandpa is johnny bravo .
okay . uh
i don 't have any cash .
what ? and then you won 't come back ?
did you know he jumped the . la ouebrada when ' he was six
it 's this insane thing they do in acapulco .
and my dad is going to throw me from there some day
what ?
to jump from that height . i think the little girl was lying .
ome here !
did you lie to me ?
it seems maggie lied to us all .
no , tell the director i did agree .
what would happen if someday ...
who would take care of maggie ?
my job allows me to give her the lifestyle she deserves .
don 't you think you spoil her rotten ?
you have no right to butt in !
dad will al ways be with ime
we 're gonna miss the flight .
i promise i will see you very soon .
he 's gone , gone .
if you 're dead , you never come back .
zoul can 't come back .
it was his way of telling me that he loved me .
and , though my fears have not left me altogether
we learned a thing or two about fear ....
why don 't we sing a song ?
let 's sing a song .
hm . that 's a good one too ,
if we can 't find investors by then ,
i know . i know . we got to land this , okay .

just because joy and sadness are gone , i have the stupid dream duty .
okay . how are we going to wake her o ?

uh-huh . add the reality distortion filter .
riley is the camera . make them get out of there .
i can 't war to get the old piley back
as soon as we get there , i 'm going to fix this whole mess .
she 's so big now . she won 't fit in my rocket .
mom amd che team
joy , we 're stuck down here .
another planet .
come on , sadness . where are you ?
oh . everything is awful and my legs don 't work .
oh no . it 's mom again . what do we do ?
no jo 10 . what is this
how do we stop it ?
make her feel scared . that will change her mind .
morning . bebe .
and i should tell you my doctor says
we got robbed on the subway ,
um , that 's a lot of energy for me .
i know we 're being quiet , which i 'm all about ,
teach on .
we are all here to become master bakers .
to be a master baker
did you say " freak ? "
we should be lab partners .
max and deke , making cakes .
okay , now stop , stop , stop .
you are a bad influence .
time to change your tampon ?
day two . serious flow .
ah , keep my needles in this .
god . you are irresistible .
a diabetic pastry chef .
so diabetes , how is that ?
stop laughing . i have to carry 27 juices
she 's my friend , even in that shirt .
i have spent more money dry cleaning this blouse
i just have to look good tomorrow .
max , you know what this means ?
no , that everything 's gonna work out at that school .
well , not totally good .
caroline , you didn 't not get anything .
but no pencils . my pencil dealer got busted .
i was not expecting it .
so that 's a 780 on verbal ,
max , i 'm writing out the check for our bank loan ,
they 're just zeroes .
i 'll go check our balance at the atm .
don 't worry . you are not going to get anything from that machine .
hey , everybody .
yeah . i mean , they call it a fast ,
then i realized my mother wasn 't coming home .
oleg and my wedding is coming up
the d-t-h is silent .
well , i guess i can put these away then .
to expose your breasts and seduce your way into this job ?
okay . well , bye .
if you really can bake ,
customers love that .
actually , joe , silent d-t-h , i can bake .
my girlfriend and i are obsessed with french pastry .
everything you just said offended me .
and the fact that you didn 't cry
first day . are you nervous , girl ?
i have no idea what most of these desserts are .
max , can you see any of the barney 's price tags on these ?
no , that 's the underwear i 'm also returning .
hi , ladies . this is naomi ,
gorgeous , but as dumb as whoever is the hot new idiot right now .
good-bye .
those pearls . they have to go .
well , honey . i love my half-blind french bulldog ,
love it .
hi , joe . big day . i 'm so excited .
i want max up front now .
why should here be any different ?
here 's your dessert . bon appetite .
neither can l .
it 's been an hour , and i haven 't seen
excuse me , max .
oh , my god .
uh , my new best friend .
you keep doing good things by accident .
i was sinking deep in sin ,
but the master of the sea
a loving person .
love lifted me .
love lifted me .... .
he could remember if your daughter was at texas ,
just made you feel real good about yourself .
he will lift you by his love ,
i am sure that bernie would be right at the top of the list .
when nothing else could help ,
i just don 't like the idea of someone spending eternity
i want to keep it simple .
i see .
now , these composite wood with cloth we sell mostly to the county
warranty ?
we , uh , guarantee that your remains
these times can be hard .
okay .
he just really cared about them .
room service .
oh , please , bernie ,
no. no. no. no . mrs. nugent .
their souls are already with the lord by the time i 'm involved .
well .
i know it 'll be the event of the season in carthage .
well , i know the bible says
well , i 'm hoping i can count on a few of you
this is my story this is my song
don 't be silly , bernie .
i 'm ... i 'm looking forward to it , too .
oh , so sweet .
he 's very sweet and very nice to me .
she isn 't all that mean like everyone says .
well , she doesn 't have anyone , don .
i 've asked her to accompany me this saturday
ain 't like she 's the richest widow in town .
don !
and if she does offer to pay for everything ,
no . don !
it was better to give than to receive .
he was generous . some folks say overly generous .
as some of you are already aware ,
i mean , every friday people would tune in just to hear bernie .
it was .. let 's see if i can remember ..
and the way he would make them " look good " in death ,
he finally got himself killed in a pool hall .
it just didn 't look right to me .
hell , for that kinda money , i bet he did kiss her .
but they 'll also suspect the best .
some resort , some ...
margy looked so much better .
she had nice hair , she looked good .
marjorie realized she had everything in front of her .
money was no object
hey , i 'll tell you one thing for sure .
and you know damn right well
to get some sexv lingerie at doris ' lingerie shop .
i mean , give me a break .
seriously .
bernie was a little effeminate .
ah ! you know , i heard that he was gay ,
there was always talk about bernie being
he was a nice-looking man
he had a tendency to hold on
you 're gonna love this .
now what i 've done is , i 've assigned numbers
and not one of you dope pushers is gonna get away .
the best trick i ever pulled
actually , what i did is i
i figured the idea of a new truck
you bet your but it did .
i think we 'd like to move some out of financials
i got a sneak-a-peek at the new line for the ..
what do you know about stocks and investing ?
well , i don 't have my phone on
okay . bye-bye .
somewhere along the way ,
he was her business manager , travel companion ,
but we still have time . we 'll be there on time , mariorie .
now i 've got to wear something else .
i told you i was going to be ...
okay , everybody , let 's
u h-oh , hold on .
it 's looking a little too uniform , okay ?
very good , relax the pose .
if i don 't call her , she will give me living hell .
mm-hm . can i bring you anything ?
we got another 40 ...
i have to go right away . thank you .
old mrs. nugent just fired me .
she said i stole a lawn mower .
oh no , no , no , no , no !
oh . god ! what have i done ?
i 'll do whatever you want me to do !
all the kids began to march
now i got off that time
take five , we 're gonna take it again from the top .
hello , billy , this is bernie tiede
she wants to try someone else .
billy , i 'm sorry , but i 'm just the messenger .
confidante sometimes ,
nobody was looking for her .
one of them lived here in carthage .
he paid for the choir to go to russia .
he bought jet skis ,
that 's a trophy shop .
i guess that was carthage 's answer to neiman 's .
you know , pay me when you can .
bernie knew my twin girls ' birthday was coming up ,
bernie bought this playhouse for my girls .
i just feel like i need to say , bernie tiede , god bless you , son .
almost everything he got from mrs. nugent ,
he thinks the family should get involved .
i don 't know why lloyd is so paranoid .
she 's at the scott white nursing home in temple .
that sounds just like mariorie .
one hundred percent .
but she 's just mean .
well , there 's some goodness in there , too .
she used to tear up mv homework .
ida says she does not like knitting , crocheting ,
beautiful dreamer
you know , i believe it was april .
well , you know , i didn 't actually ... see her that day , i ..
bernie comes to the door , says she 's feeling poorly .
i go on about my business .
i appreciate your help .
and got him all riled up .
you know , i think llovd 's just upset
she simply doesn 't want to be disturbed .
well , that 's fine with me .
i 'm sorry you had to get wrapped up in all this .
we had loaded up the freezer with its contents intact
oh , there 's one man in particular i can think of
we 're still looking for him .
alright , look ..
we might be dealing with a madman here ,
it 's really just yourself .
then no matter what the scoreboard says ,
why 'd you want her dead , bernie ?
i ... i couldn 't face being around her any longer .
i don 't know . i shot her !
with the armadillo gun .
well , then the lord called her home .
elizabeth , i just heard bernie killed your sister margy .
you got this sweet guy , you got bernie ,
so you got this sweetness and you got this evil ,
we 're all capable of that dark moment .
he must 've wanted to get caught .
no body , no arrest .
then they probably wouldn 't even done an autopsy .
that he wouldn 't .
leave poor bernie alone , danny buck .
he confessed .
you knew mrs. nugent as well as any of us did .
self defense .
they could 've beat it out of him .
look , there was no interrogation .
simple as that .
even if he did do it ,
he only shot her four times , not five .
yes , we need to be able to
so , folks , we need to understand
that god and this congregation
good to see you .
reverend . now listen ,
hey , i gotta stay neutral , everybody needs a preacher .
hey , i gotta stay neutral , everybody needs a preacher .
reverend , basically you were supporting a criminal act .
nobody 's talking about poor marjorie .
danny , the bernie you 're talking about
it sounds like the only bernie you 're choosing to remember
here they come !
clearly , the tiny town of carthage is buzzing
he didn 't do it .
ain 't no jury gonna convict bernie of first decree murder .
they ain 't gonna send him to the penitentiary .
now , we are going to line the bottom
now , we are going to saute the broccoli lightly in olive oil
i 'm not saying we want the case totally dropped ,
so let me ask you something , mrs. beck .
if i 'm on that jury , danny buck ,
i mean , it 's like he cast a spell over the entire area .
with mrs. nugent 's money .
but i had one card left to play .
trials are generally moved when the judge determines
but in all the years i 've been doing this for a living ,
our donkey 's in a ditch . "
a poor excuse for a casket .
there 's some wild shit on both sides of the courtroom .
they wheeled in the actual deep freeze .
and then i went to the freezer .
it was so horrible .
when was the last time you talked to your grandmother ?
isn 't it true that you and your brother
a lawyer ?
or are we talking about your lawyer ?
i don 't think so .
well , you know you didn 't .
now was that the same woman you were suing for money ?
i felt in our hearts we were still close .
and bernie was just gonna have to get up there
i mean , shoot , i wouldn 't let ' em work on my car .
after you were arrested you gave a confession , correct ?
i cared for mariorie deeplv .
and i 've sent letters from jail to her family
why do you reckon you killed her ?
she wouldn 't allow me to have any friends ,
she had become so hateful .
it was like someone else was doing it .
it would seem to me that
i could never do that .
everyone deserves a proper burial .
did he try to poison her slowly ? no .
say it was an accidental fire ? no .
he knew he was gonna get found out .
but like a good funeral director ,
he just doesn 't sound like
that doesn 't excuse the crime that was committed .
" oh , he 's so wonderful . he 's an angel . "
thank you .
mr. foreman , it is mv understanding
is it unanimous ?
and i will always feel that way .
assistant director ceobernie was a good man .
secona assistant dre we need more bernies in this world .
500 feet , dr. hunt .
i 'm not joking . that 's two strikes .
this patient needs a neurosurgeon
somebody page me when he 's gone .
hey , i was just trying to call .
just jo .
did something happen ?
jo 's my best friend . and you told maggie , so ..
whoa , whoa . hang on . stop squirming .
li ... hi . what ... what are you doing here ?
oh , you know , just .. failing .
let me . let me .
yeah . i got her . hey .
it j-just .. just went up her back .
yeah . well , it 's bad . it 's a bad one . yeah .
you 're good .
it 's ... i think we got it .
this whole building is bad vibes .
and that 's not gonna help her heal .
there 's nothing to heal .
so ... she 's got time .
and you didn 't feel the need to call me immediately ?
would that have been better ? snare .
understood . won 't happen again .
you will never change .
who the fuck asked you ?
gilberto , you 're the fucking man .
i need to focus on my future , my career .
i 'm sorry , but that 's just how it is .
maybe she 's right .
maybe , i should move out of here .
you always have a place here at meine castle .
come on .

how could this happen ? know i fell , but i felt fine afterwards .

we 're ready to go .
at that moment lynette began to think of the baby she had yet to meet .
and to kiss his tiny hand .
you can 't think that way .
he might not even have one .
but you should start thinking about the future , because no matter what , it 's coming .
you got it all wrong !
we gotta stick together on this !
so after all that , i was about to become thanksgiving dinner .

i 'd like to introduce the great turkey !
my best friend .

if you answer nicely , you might survive this interview .
am i supposed to be scared ? my boss is more powerful than you .
he 's that good , is he ? maybe i can find a job for him in my company .
we 've only just begun .
goodbye .
tony , where are you ?
i 'm done on my end !
the control tower 's gone !
wait ! i see some movement down in the rubble
send black widow to pick him up !
you 're a kid yourself , tony , an obstinate , stubborn kid .
why do you keep putting me in that position ?
it 's intriguing , though . i find i 'm drawn to more mature women .
darn , lit
iron man is not responding . all signals are being blocked .
team red , move in on my command . capture and contain !
i suppose it 's too late to apologize .
right away , sir .
i 'm afraid he 's fully booked for the next three years or so .
then he blames me when he misses his appointments .
into something unexpected he can 't handle .
obviously .
tell your associates a.i.m. says hello .
shit ! it 's the pmisher ow did he urack me ?
they don 't deserve to live
if you shoot , i 'll blast you from here to tokyo !
i appreciate it . all right . let 's get
do you think an a.i.m. man would give up the identity of his clients ?
i guess our job is done . let 's get out of here .
it 's military issue .
actually this place kind of reminds me of a jungle .
at the age of 16 !
having inherited all that , i 'm sure a clever kid like him
you 're right . there 's no denying that .
to make himself smarter than he already was .
one of his interests is techno-organic armor .
he won 't be an easy opponent to handle
i 'm hacking directly into the s.h.i.e.l.d. network . i figure if
stark has joined forces with frank castle ,
i want to get out of this country as quickly as possible . if it 's discovered
shanghai ?
we had a weapons research center there ,
the hotel 's privacy is as tight as a swiss bank .
bzelxiel called that the wind .
he 's planning to wipe out everything that lives on this planet !
stark ! what are you planning to do ?
if i can divert the power of the arc reactor and aim it at the technovores ,
after that ,
i guess we should return to the bridge .
he 's here !
stop this , now !
don 't worry about them . connect it .
what back door
when did you set up my voice as the password ?
don 't remember that . youl wouldn 't
thank you very much , mr. president .
i 'm only able to control one satellite and i won 't have control for long !

the technovores are trying to take over the howard by hacking in !
tens of seconds , that 's al
affirmative
aim at what
you seem surprised .
you almost look like you could suit up right now .
i grew up in galveston . oh , well .
you were something to watch .
i 'm yours . how can i help you ?
pleasant meadows ?
few years back , she had a complete nervous breakdown
all i get are some letters in the mail .
well , it 's just that i don 't wanna hire anyone from there
hey , carson .
we 're talking about galveston here .
not a thing . just not for me .
a beautiful woman with a sob story
she became irresistible .
the drone of the tires against the asphalt
the land of cowboys , beautiful women ,
.. and the holiest of holy .
the beatles and vietnam had come and gone ,
i ran out on jayne , the only woman i 've ever loved ,
and it isn 't .
enough about me . how about you ? you doing well ?
well , we have that in common .
i told you . there 's no secrets in this town .
sure , i did .
why is it that i 'm having such a hard time getting ahold of her ?
no harm in dealing a little dope , is there ?
lorenzo ? uhh .
after all , he 's a doctor , isn 't he ?
hell , you know me . i 'm just curious .
instead , i saw lorenzo .
after listening to slide 's fairy tales ,
thought you said you were just passing through .
have you been hired by javne hunt ?
oh , come on . protect becky .
it seems like it 's open-shut to me .
i don 't buy it .
what are you getting at ?
but they didn 't want him dead , they just wanted him to mess up .
i think all that la sunshine has done made you a bit loopy .
light me .
all right .
to happy .
is that your mourning dress ?
what there is of it .
you wanna know if i killed him ?
that is not the point .
of course they don 't . i 'm rich .
look , you gotta come straight with me
from what i understand
they tested the groundwater .
found all this out after charlie died .
well ...
i ...
our daughter .
the hell you talking about ?
why wouldn 't you tell me something like that ?
don 't i have something to do with that decision ?
you could tell a lot just by the way she looked at you .
i asked her what was really going on .
when charlie proposed ..
she made the right choice .
ain 't nothing gonna happen to you .
you ever think about whether we 'll get to do that to him ?
come on , habibi .
you can have the bed , sir .
yet the boy you raise has the name eichmann , does he not ?
so , you let another man 's progeny call you father .
foreman . mercedes benz factory .
they 're using him as bait .
el al is refusing to send a plane .
a signed document from eichmann saying he 'll willingly come to israel .
they 're out of their minds .
can 't we have dani fake it ?
problem is , we 're on the other side of the hotel ,
nothing , just the cop ,
if we get to the laundry , we can get to the door .
but we can get access to the roof .
okay , so , listen , take the ventilation system
alex , you want to get the company off our backs ?
sara 's holding my mother there .
and clear our names in all this .
yes , but he is my son .
and right now it is believed
no , no , no , you see , that 's the problem , michael .
nandu , let 's take a breath here .
your son and i had planned to use the technology
but now they are mine , and at the end of the day ,
agent self 's already inside .
agent don self .
yeah , it 's hooks .
was his name don self ?
now she 's going to have everything she ever hoped for .
if she succeeds in provoking another war ,
why didn 't you do it yourself ?
because if india 's involved , that drags in pakistan .
then within a year , europe 's in it
she 's gonna need a head c.t. to rule out a traumatic brain injury .
uh , no , but i found some textbooks .
i 'm guessing she 's about 16 years old .
mom .
we don 't have much time .
good . you 're here .
she needs to go to the o.r. for a washout .
jess .
i-is she still alive ?
i-i-i don 't know her . so ...
i think you do know each other .
because miranda bailey is anything but soft .
we need someone who will make us uncomfortable ,
and you know it .
you 're only 15 . you want to die ?
you were standing in front of a train .
okay , jess , i 'm gonna tell you something personal about myself , okay ?
and i like women , too .
can i ask you something personal about yourself ?
do you ...
yeah .
not if it 's you .
why don 't people want to live with me ?
no , you 're not . nobody 's paging you .
i watched you push people around for years .
hell , you bullied george . ext
really ?
i didn 't look like the other girls . i didn 't act like them .
so i learned to fight . titanium screw , please ?
so you were both bullies ?
i mean , really think about that .
or when i was screaming for help
maybe you got it worse at home , or maybe you 're just bullying
and pushing us around makes you feel better
you 're cool .. now .
i-i mean , it sounds like your hospital 's doing great work .
i fund most of those trips through my nonprofit .
oh , your nonprofit . well , now .
patient 's chest is already open .
they 're saying wexler and hall are out .
find out how long .
got it .
it 's not my save , sir . they did the hard work .
well , i should probably get go ...
is it ' cause i have a kid or is it ' cause i 'm a boss ?
hey , did you hear , uh , dr.torres stabbed
oh , my god ! i lost control . i am a monster .
worth every penny . it was beautiful .
yeah , we want details .
yes , no , i can see that , but what are you doing ?
the patient is in terrible pain .
so , what , you 're just gonna not show up for the presentation ?
look , i just spent the day with tracy mcconnell .
i took it at school after a game .
they look really happy .
i 'm steven .
your patient 's been out of surgery a while .
because this hospital is worth more than that .
um , hi . hello .
i 'm sure dr. mcconnell gave you an excellent presentation .
she would be excellent for the job .
the point is mcconnell and i offer different things .
i know . i spent the whole day with her .
and that 's what this place is to her .. her newest challenge ...
and her next .
as far as i 'm concerned , it 'll always be the ship
i believe in this hospital and what it can do .
suture .
ready to close .
yeah , i must say , that may not be a lesson
currently , you 're being paid under a grant
but if i 'm a professor , then i 'll have to teach a class .
so your solution is to promote me and pay me more money
you people are sick .
just give me a minute .
then i have to sit through lunch
uh , no . actually , i didn 't invite her .
well , ever since she helped me get this job ,
that is not true .
wonderful .
that 's where i 'm a little fuzzy .

okay , good luck . and call me later ,
hey , amy .
maybe we sneak in some pinot .. make it color me wine .
oh . well , good luck getting her to do that .
you remember when she did that ?
i was probably being too hard on her .
oh . great .

there are children in the hole ?
i took you for a man of principles .
i am helping her .
she wants to go down .
can you bring animals into the hole ?
it 's not a great idea to bring a sausage dog in here .

only a lunatic would leave level 6 .
you 're ridiculous up there .

i have the information ,
and why is that ?
i said i 'll be back .
nice bike .

you got ambitious , yeah ?
highest level , yeah .
but it 's still a gamble , isn 't it ?
i can 't write well enough to bother , or i just don 't bother , whichever .
i mean , we all have something to offer .
genius is magical , not material .
miss phillips ,

more words ?
i mean , you do realise that this certain person
half the fucking tenured faculty would be
why do you care about that
motherfucker !
i think you would agree that modification is possible .
i know you 're in real trouble .

i 've said good-bye before to people i love .
i have done it many , many times .
i just want you not to have it any more .
hey .
i 'm not your doctor .
but let me be your uncle .
i know what i have to do
it 's post-intellectual .
i 'm not in any position to say anything
because what you said before .
right now . all right , this is not happening
absolutely fucking not
but that was somebody else .
which is fine , because the novel 's basically okay ,
well , what do you propose we move on to ?
we 're not having this conversation .

i know a lot , but i don 't fucking know that .
you are the perfect example
well , i don 't like people with problems or the fucking vanity to bring them up .

so you don 't die .
aren 't you afraid of dying from something other than natural causes ?
your grandfather pops , and you don 't have any money ?

with the advance and royalties , $ 17,000 all in .

why would i tell you i made a mistake ?
okay .
that is the last time that you lie to me , my friend .

really ? who says ?
i do
don 't lie to yourself . i don 't .
nothing happened .
if i come to your door , then i 'll have made it ,
and what you do with the dead is bury them , that 's it !

" i have a car and a house and a family ,
i 'll have a beer , just like anybody else , thank you .
any kind .

i wanted to talk to you .
i decided to top amy 's little " forgotten coat " trick
i know that i don 't know her ,
i needed the weekend !
and what about las vegas
no , no , no , it 's fine .

right this way , uncle harvey .
i 'm trying not to attract attention .
well , you 're good guys , so i 'll , uh ...

i do . we got married .
i didn 't have a whole lot .

hey . if she is she obviously don 't want to talk to you .
you were gonna come around today , right ?
i gotta go back in the block .
and he 's helping you with that contraption .
he deserves punishment as much as the rest of these guys .
i 'm less interested in punishment than i am in rehabilitation .
you delegated authority over gen pop to me , boss .
you gotta let me do my job or pass it on somebody else .
there 's a reason i 'm giving you more and more responsibility .
you can think what you want about me but ..
see ?
she wanted me to talk to you first in case you got mad ..
you 're a con.and that 's all you 'll ever be .
yeah . he 's right in here .
then why are you in the masonry section ?

you know what ?
me , mami . believe me .
baby where is this coming from ?
look , there 's just so many things .
i 'm well aware of that .
i don 't think a man should be killed for something he didn 't do .
we get many requests for representation .
and i have to decide which cases
please .
we just don 't have the manpower .
she 's just leaving now .
he was pushing alternative energy .
oil companies , the saudis , even our government ...
why did you wait till now to take up this case ?
i just hope it 's not too late .
you need to prepare yourself for that .
why death penalty work ?
back off , man .
it leads to hell !
he 's taking us all to hell !
i told you not to go around me with the pope .
good to be back , man . good to have you back .
good afternoon , mr scofield .

and not one of the cool ones
i 'm sorry , you go , have fun .
no . i just need to make sure he 's okay .
do , or do not .
please don 't yoda me .
and this really nice guy came up to talk to me .
and , i don 't know ,
so when are we gonna start touching ?

then this human came from out of nowhere and snatched her up ,
sil , do you think the storm will pass soon ?

maybe we don 't have to fly .
trim the sail ! trimming the sail !

a temper tantrum of this magnitude is unacceptable .
then how did this happen ? and the truth this time .
elizabeth , the truth .
you 've got to stop this nonsense !
you have a real fairy living in your room ?
just look at the research we did .
field journals are to be filled with fact , not fairy tales .
i don 't understand this foolishness , lizzy . you have such talent
i believe in what is real ,
i know this is difficult for you to understand
elizabeth , this discuss on is over .
it .. it .
why are you here ?
it 's kind of a psychiatric version of purgatory .
they give you a room if you show a willingness to conform .
the good news is ..
what are you doing on the stairs ?
everybody does . everybody does .
anxiety and vomit .
it 's being ugly and stupid ..
it 's on nine .
suki ? it 's dr. satomi . can you hear me ?
oh , hold on . look at me .
we can 't live here
this place is a dump . don 't worry .
shh . shut up .
we 're not safe here . no one 's gonna take care of you .
so what about you ? i thought you were cured .
ding .

oh , you 'd be crazy not to be .
i 'd do anything to stay here .
that multiple personality thing of yours next .
you can 't do multiple personalities . you barely got one .
you 're the only sane person i know .

wow , i like what you 've done with the place .
well , i hope you didn 't give any of ' em to me .
you 'd be amazed at the weird shit you can hear up here .
cryptic messages in the white noise .
almost down to the last tw .
anyway , i need to borrow a video camera .
but if you 're thinking ..
no one will care . it 's easier to stay off the stairs .
this is more of a personal project .
this one 's a solo act .
make me a copy .
can you believe that ?
that 's why i moved out .
all i want is a couch and a bit of love .
thank you for the gentle reminder , dr. kareem .
this time we are not trying to cure the incurable .
we will focus on burning out as many alters as possible for now , dr. kareem .

i didn 't know she was so messed up in her head
i thought she was gonna kill me .
that 's not you .
no , you 're right . i am her .
no , it 'll kill you !
you sometimes have to let your hands make decisions for you .
you watch them like they belong to someone else .
you watch your hands writing backwards .
you learn to think from the bottom up .
good-bye , hogan .
the machine belongs to me now
first the hens , then the rooster . i 'm coming back for you , boy .
god made me this way , fhogan .

your wife says you have something important to tell me .
oh , god ! you are gonna leave me !
it 's okay .
it 's not ... definite .
don 't bother .
stop it , ma .
i knew she was behind this !
okay , okay .
now , can we please change the subject ?
explain why you 've been gone so long
you know , i 'm growing to like american football .
we 've already dosed him twice .
you 're just gonna keep him on bypass ?
what the hell happened ?
his heart didn 't restart .
he 's been on bypass multiple times before , right ?
and i-i think the most helpful thing we can tell you is
she 's right . that 's reasonable .
hey , she didn 't compromise .
yeah . you tell him , babe .
as soon as i get home .
i 've never been to palm springs .
that 's like walking out of pinocchio
i 'm in this relationship , too .
of course you do .
oh . he can try . he 'd just need a good locksmith .
the girl in front of us got strawberry .
no . no , if we both like it ,
one arm 's probably bigger than the other .
you are truly wise .
that 's me being polite .
lenin is a real artist .
our first course is a french delicacy .
marissa , this is caroline , max 's business partner .
she 's usually not covered in this much sweat .
um , if i had a credit card ,
oh , there 's no music allowed here .
not my words .
i think i 'd like to make a toast .
i 've begun not to like you .
not even a little light piano ?
hey , caroline , please . just sit .
i 'm fine .
caroline .
okay , no i haven 't .
it 's the same look you gave chestnut
they couldn 't possibly think one person
i think it 's beyond sick .
my shoes are too big now .
hey , it happens .
you 're just not used to rich food .
and if this is randy 's world ...
then maybe my body is telling me i can 't take it .
he is moving here for me .
i wish your best friend
i don 't know how to do that .
what ?
sorry . i love you , but you need a mint .
what do you think of the name sheila newman ?
randy .
what happened ? where 'd you go ?
she didn 't want to be sick in front of you .
so ... now we have 2 nieces in our guardianship .
and that is what we shall say when questions are asked
that is the nature of order
girls !
i have no experience in the ways of breaking grave news to you .
have the opportunity to make his better acquaintance .
i mean to say , if that is your inclination .
where do you get your information ?
and what of you , miss lindsay ?
well
well , then spell it out to her ..
she has no reason . her inheritance leaves her free to marry .
a portrait ? are you sure ?
papa , should he not have wished to see me before deciding ?
mr. davinier , i believe you 've already had the pleasure .
decide what ?
you are simply to sit still , dido . not a very challenging task .
as you always are , right beside each other .
how should any male know the ways of a lady
he is in the presence of a lady when she is , in fact , still a juvenile .
no , not now .
upon the death of her husband , a widow may receive .
she has 40 days to leave her husband 's home .
to provide certainty where there otherwise might be none .
the zong ship and those drowned
but where my father relies on the bible ,
one day , yes , my lord .
that is l ... i mean to say ...
you have grand ambitions .
but you have neither the rank nor the finances for any more .
hymn number 76 .
wait
of course .
perhaps yours is a life less concerned with such matters .
it is a fact that i have contemplated on the matter for many hours
tell me what you know .
do not render me your amusement .
and what .. what is that ?
they were diseased , but it was essential that they die on the journey ...
neither , too , if they had expired of their diseases .
you have taken advantage of confidential matters afforded you .
her precious care is in my hands ..
i will gather my belongings .
we should merely take a turn around vauxhall .
most delighted .
i did not think i would ever find a lady
i am not at ease with this . lord mansfield would be most aggrieved .
we are just two families spending some time together .
your dear husband could have no objection , could he ?
despite such pronounced protestations from your brother ?
foolish .
when your better half has equipped you so well with ..
what a lovely sound .
i do hope you know how well i think of you .
i might have only dreamed of these moments , at one time .
then i hope you plan to honor your attentions
to refuse from hereon to insure slaves on any ship .
how can we expect to be civilized
it is more than that
you should return . they will be anxious .
goodbye .. mr. davinier .
we commune at the coaching inn , kentish town ..
quite .
she will need a gentleman who can temper her .
she is an exquisite girl .
lady mansfield , what is it ?
do you hear that , james ? a lady 's good breeding alone will not do .
but what of her own father ?
who , i am told , is to inherit everything
each time i set eyes on that girl she becomes more beautiful
blessed by law to inherit your father 's wealth .
all that remains .
what i 'm trying to say is , uh .
offer you all that is due to mrs. oliver ashford .
since it would very much be my privilege ..
t cannot see ! shh !
should we not wait a day or two .. for mr. james ?
will you join us , dido ?
oh . i am terribly light-headed this morning , mama .
good lord , i forgot .
tell me , are you to share his dining room as well as his bed ?
and you are foolish enough to marry him . i , on the other hand .
though she does make for rather amusing sport .
my aunt ?
i should rather make a nuisance of myself alone in london ...
where is everyone , mabel ? all the carriages are gone .
completely . elizabeth always asked the questions for me .
papa is to finally speak in a few days and
they are some of the most powerful in these isles
if he speaks the words and condemns the trade ..
for the slave laws of england and its colonies to remain absolute .
i 've heard nothing from him since vauxhall , dido .
that he meant it this time
i shall ask papa to use a portion of my inheritance for your dowry .
i saw you with mr. davinier ...
you said nothing .
to trust me .
7oul know
i simply hope he 's worth it .
but on this occasion you will have to forgive me .
then let me be clear i understand
you will be formalizing in law the concept of insuring human cargo .
then know that when you are gone ,
miss lindsay is not a slave .
at its extreme , and an impossible task ...
each implies a severe threat to the lives of the seamen .
our law is transparent and unequivocal .
without pausing to restore water supplies .
chose a tight packing fashion to transport their slaves .
is well-known to cause disease in slaves .
it is not legal
i didn 't want to ,
but then i was a miracle worker .
you love me because i 'm a sensitive guy .
qadri ?
dr. avery was the warrior .
i mean , if he hadn 't come along ...
you saved his life .
so , today will be her brachial plexus surgery
you need to drive around .
i hate that i did this to you .
became another name
is that what we 're calling it now ? that walk you took ?
fog and bears and wolves .
none that we could see , but i could hear them !
yeah , got it .
she saves lives every day , and she ...
judge ...
so why commit insurance fraud ?
he 's 35 , he could do an ironman ,
did you do an echo or a v / q ?
i ...
jai was hanging on the edge of a cliff
but she hung on ,
so , i 'm wondering if she should have ...
what ?
muscle beach body builder ,
it looked like it was a stroke .
well , thanks , i think ,
yeah , no . now i 'm sorry .
i feel like people are looking at us .
okay .
deluca , will you page dr. avery and tell him
left ? no . to where ?
he handed off all his patients .
" leave of absence , " right .
the schedule 's a mess , i know ,
he needs time to learn ..
i never needed to .
you see a problem , fix it . no commentary necessary .
just , you know , to kick us off .
karev has scheduled three-hour surgeries
that 'll smooth out this whole board .
wait . no , no , no . karev .

i mean , i know that we hurt each other ,
i mean , life happens . life comes around .
life is boring .
i 'm sorry . i 'm sorry .
it 's boring me , but it makes the epidural abscess ,
i don 't like being alone .
the other shop-class kids have been discharged .
oh , you got lucky .
well , next time your gut talks about one of my patients ,
i was right .
you 've got to be kidding me . what now ?
no pulse with cpr .
all right , tell me what you need .
i got the right side . you take the left .
what the hell happened ?
we 're a cocoon .
or maybe not .
and this way , you have a safety net , no matter what happens .
no way he got over on frost , he 's captured . or dead .
there 's no shame in retreating to regroup , sir .

i 'm off the budget because of some grunt-case
and you 're off the budget because you embarrassed him .
no . peters .
at the va .
what they did , what it cost .
so , i think he deserves a little compassion .
so , if he wants to sleep during the days
he told me you have a contact list .
so , that 's what you want ?
no , i would ..
i hope you 're sincere about this ,
thank you .

by five , he should 've stopped playing with dolls .
that morning , mum was going to visit granddad and grandma .
and how is your father ?
so you 've been left to your own devices .
not having him .
i 've actually had a bit of breakthrough with the game .
so you finally finished it ?
i 'd been trying to give the player too much choice .
and now they 've got the illusion of free will , but really ..
and is it a happy ending ?
then that 's great .

why don 't you just shut up , sea urchin dude ?
for a brat like you to know my name ,
it 's said you 're as strong as the ten commandments .
am i right ?
i don 't know who you are , but you must want to die badly .
the one who didn 't choose me to be in the ten commandments ..
i will never forgive him !
is this the one collecting our souls ?
my body ..
any filth that approaches the ceremony
who 'll give me leftovers if you die !

as thanks for what you did to our captain ,
why have you returned ?
that 's wrong , father !
you threw aside your pride as a celestial and ran !
but we haven 't been fighting just to follow the laws !
it will most likely hold for three minutes .
so , you 're solaad .
you look good !
sure . i expect plenty of rewards .
it 's very rewarding .
if you come down and give a talk . you know , give the kids some pointers .

my assistant knows my schedule better than me .

this isn 't a joke .
this is my child . we 're doing this together .
daddy 's mad .
i mean , why do you need two ?

if you don 't mind ,
howard has announced his intention
the original piece of gossip indicated an impending breakup .
the group consensus is that his proposal
although oddly , no one tweeted .
are you familiar with meme theory ?
meme theory suggests that
at johnson elementary school ,
that 's gold .

i break a couple hearts almost everyday
what are you up to ?
what do you think ?

follow ellen to the freight elevator .
how much is this thing ?
what 's happening ?
from someone who pronounces the word business
you knew the business wasn 't working .
that 's ' cause you don 't listen .
your big business plan is cupcakes
and i thought the back of our t-shirt could just say ,
okay , maybe like gordon said ,
we stayed up all night , and to be honest ,
business is not for the faint of heart
let 's give ' em some love .
yup , and i feel pretty good about it .
i wonder if i can get diabetes before breakfast .
that candy was just a decoy ,

sophie , we don 't know what it is .

i 'm only in high school and i see casual sexism on the daily .
we don 't need-her .
phil , am i doing this or not ?
all right . wendy , let 's get you in that minivan

this museum has been a shining beacon to our great city .
there 's nothing on it .
i 'm confused , because there 's not a list
i want to spread my wings .
but you can 't spread your wings and fly to nowhere .
boy , could that man move .
cecil .
you look like you 're doing pretty good .
i need to talk to you about the tablet .
hey , gis . you 're looking well .
are you here to frame us again ?
cried to move on .
it 's turning green , like some sort of corrosion .
jed and octavius .
it 's like the green rust is affecting them .
the locals , they warned us .
i thought it meant the end of the world .
end of the magic ?
hi , there .
i bet you 're not so mean .
you 're just a little puppy who wants to play .
want to play fetch ?
you want to play with this bone ?
not exactly .
we are , but we got to do this first .
a quest is one thing . it 's not , like , " holy grail and a monkey . "
fountain of youth ?
but i assure you , he 's no fool .
the tablet that you carry is magic ?
everything around you has come to life tonight for the very first time ..
then they 're not real ?
yes , but we 're real people .
they must be unbelievably stupid .
we ust have calculus together .
fleeting moments of eye contact .
good .
you 're right .
let 's wake it up and then kill it
why not ?
larry , there comes a time in every man 's life ..
not this kid , all right ?
anyway , that 's just an expression .
he 's not gonna slay his dragon right now .
we 're gonna go around now , or else we 're gonna lose the signal .
you fought bravely , sire .
i 'm good with just , like , soda or water , too .
from now on , you must choose your own path .
we better let larry know we 're okay .
larry 's probably worried about us .
lawrence ?
i 'm becoming wax again , son .
we got to get to egypt now .
nick is right .
the wolves are at the door .
well , a good thrashing , if you ask me .

we 're struggling through a bit of chaos this morning .
unfortunately . mr. banks , our business cannot wait .
you could use those to pay off the loan .
shares ? in the bank ?
ready and charged , sir .
aunt jane was only ..
because your father owns shares in the bank .
well , i can make more money .

yes , it is , isn 't it ?
mary poppins used to be our nanny .
same thing that brought me the first time .
us ? oh , yes , you too .
we can do anything a nanny can .
you can 't do that , can you ?
oh , let him believe what he likes .
actually ...
actually , i 'd like to get back to the matter of my employment .
mary poppins isn 't just anyone .
no one 's hiring nannies anymore .
well , neither will we by the end of the week !
you sound just like father . i do not !
you need help just as much as she does !
what are you two whispering about ?
" nothing . " such a useful word , isn 't it ?
it 's just that
but a bath would prove useful .
mother always had us take our baths in the evening .
the perfect time of day to have a bath
just your old drawings , and bills , and nothing else .
father . aunt jane !
very thing you could ever dream of !
i have no idea what you 're all talking about .
enough , please !
no , ' m sorry . i 'msorry .
john , annabel , put all the books back on the bookshelves .

second wednesday . oh , cear . i 'd forgotten .
there we are !
so , in you come .
oh , no !
now , what do you want ?
you might at least greet them at the door .
when i am down here , up on the ceiling ?
in money ?
but that doesn 't make it any less beautiful .
well , i 'm sure it was to her .
it is all in the way that you look at things .
now , come along , children . get your hats .
will fix and make perfect for you .
yes . spit spot .
sit over there , please , children .

he could give you more time to save the house .
well , you didn 't help !
i know its been a hard year for our family ..
to keep you all from worrying , but i can 't do this on my own .
i can 't even seem to remember my briefcase in the morning ..
and i can 't lose this house . i just can 't .
i 'm sorry . i don 't know what to do .
haven 't we lost enough already ?
last night , mary poppins told us ..

what is it , father ? wait .
yes ! yes !
what 's the time ? anyone ?
seven minutes ? its not enough time .
take the van . no , it 's no good .
well , what can we do ? oh
everything is possible .
can we do that , mary poppins ?
well , i don 't see why that couldn 't be arranged .

but that time is wrong .
that 's banks .

with a lot of signatures on it .
he 's been planning this all along !
i 've had enough of their lies .
don 't you care .
only wish i 'd believed them sooner !
and told us to guard it well .
we did just that .
if i do say so myself ...

i don 't need that kind of shit .
in my line of work , i have to be very careful ,
gentlemen , i believe our business is finished .

the woman hacked off two of her fingers
you 're still standing here .
so tell me , how do you know
seeing ? as in dating ?
well , i don 't like spreading vicious gossip ..
that guy is gay .
i didn 't say he was gay . i said if i had magic powers ,
no . i am sure it wasn 't him .
i have what scientists call
" was " ? interesting .
okay , then explain why he 's the one chasing me .
our policy here is ask questions first ,
what 's there to know ? you point , you shoot ,
to protect myself .
why not just get a dog ?
i can 't stay here .
this has nothing to do with felicia .
paul , y-you can 't leave the lane .
no , i don 't . i never have .
you were the reason i wanted to live here .
we spent every day
sooner or later , the past always catches up .
you have a chance to start over now .
were you in love with him ?
come on .
and i loved my wife , too .
until the camping trip when pete told me
why didn 't you tell me ?
but if your wife is the one who cheated ,
and that 's why i wanna get things right this time .
what do you think ?

me ? i 'm not trying ?
what do you call this ?
stop saying that .
i killed martha .
i haven 't been him for a long time .
officers , can you take my statement ?
whether it 's knowing we 're desired ...
or finding the strength to do the right thing .
to be false .
they would remember the crisp chardonnay ...
and the savory chicken .
wasn 't the food .
susan delfino had missed many things ...
the smile of the cheerful mailman ...
all right , then i guess we 'll be showering separately .
don 't worry . i won 't be using any .
should we just order pizza ?
you want me to unpack for you ?
thought you missed your friends .
oh , i 'm sorry . i 'm just back from a run and on my way out

i walked in , and you were back ..

he loved her so deeply that he was willing to be patient ..
okay , open .
it 's a little book of inspiration
it 's right on the coast . look . see ? there 's the lighthouse .
it 's even more beautiful in person ,
oh , i feel it already . hmm .
this is exactly what i need right now .
yeah , the murder , the investigation ,
yeah , she does .
isn 't it time you two patched things up ?
i tried all that .
now after the break ,
made it to the train with time to spare .
i was sort of hoping she 'd change her mind
i think i know .
no . everything pretty much sucks .
so i wrote up a resume .
i mean , you 're young , energetic .
though not proficient in spelling it .
waiting tables at the carlyle .
i 'd take classes , learn about the business ...
or even own my own restaurant , just like my parents used to .
yeah . there 's just one problem .
you should take that job .
porter , me . i 'm the day care .
i will spoil the heck out of her .
it 's a baby . who could be stuck ?
well , for me , it 's a dream come true .
come on .
whatever .
just get over your silly fight and take him back .
really ? then how come you 're over here and not him ?
i fed the flames of your little spat
but now carlos is coming back ,
what 's going on with you two ?
now take your stolen flowers and your clippers and ...
my bassinet ? the one all five of you kids slept in ?
now my kid gets to sleep in it .
yeah . yeah , it does .
what are you doing here ?
and letting you know your financial troubles are over .
it 'll be much easier getting things done around here
well , who 's gonna watch her while you 're at work ?
she hasn 't taken care of a baby in forever .
so what are you gonna do with all this time to yourself ?
bye , paige . thank you !
what ?
yeah , i do .
look at my smart daughter , piecing it together .
no , and he 's not going to .
maybe you should let him help you .
karen !
i 'm not putting him through it again .
don 't do this to him .
oh ! you know what we need here ?
oh , i 'm not caffeinated .
is there any sugar ?
that baby is gonna feel right at home here .
uh-huh . are you gonna keep julie 's bed ?
i just realized the other day .
miriam ?
miriam .
don 't worry .
i forgot that i keep a spare key in the pouch .
it 's like having a mobile purse .
what ?
i had to do something to stop him .
protect me ?
they tormented me , almost drove me to suicide .
so i wrote the letters
because as long as they were in your life ,
i had to have you all to myself .
you 're insane .
bree , we both know what it means to commit a crime
i was protecting people i love .
no , i did it for both of us !
you 're a sick , pathetic man ,
oh , i don 't believe that .
none of this makes any sense .
i just never thought my life would end up like this .
lynette , i come from white trash .
really ?
i 'm two weeks away
yeah , i don 't think susan 's life
yeah ...
that 's the thing about lynette .
i took the kids off her hands for a week .
then she started calling every ten minutes
exactly .
yeah .
she 's lost a lot .
i think that 's why she 's going so overboard
you know , you 're taking all my anger away ,
it 'll leave you your friend .
ladies and gentlemen ...
aw , crap .
go , go . i 'll wait for you . go .
it 's probably just some designs they switched so they can copy them .
says so on the label , " made in taiwan . "
richard , i got to go . and seriously .
i 'm sorry .
stop ! stop it ! take this off me right now !
take this off me right now !
all you have to do is go into the hotel and ask for him at the reception .
i 'm so sorry . i really have no choice .
hello , miss . i speak english . i translate for mr. jang .
yes , okay , okay . hold on .
no , i don 't know what 's in the case .
yes , i do . i studied one year at international high school in new york .
richard gave me the case to give to you , that 's all i know .
he gave me a paper with numbers written on it . what is this ?
he wants you to hurry up . mr. jang has other things to do .
it 's four plastic pouches filled with a blue powder . like a .
mr. jang wants to offer you a job .
i don 't want a job .
this is where life as we know it begins .
it 's not possible to determine any sign of intelligence yet .
one neuron , you 're alive . two neurons ,
yet most species only use 3 to 5 % of its cerebral capacity .
10 % may not seem like much , but it 's a lot if you look at all we 've done with it .
the only living being that uses its brain better than us .
it is estimated that this incredible animal
but the dolphin did not invent the sonar , it developed it naturally .
can we therefore conclude that humans are concerned more with
what did you do to my stomach ?
it 's very well done . and ...
save time .
let 's imagine for a few moments
sir ? yes .
for the moment , it 's just hypothesis , i confess . but if you think about it ,
whom everybody took for a fool when he put forth his theory of evolution .
100 billion neurons per human , of which only 15 % are activated .
we possess a gigantic network of information
thanks very much . i 'll send you the paperwork for the transfer .
okay , we got all three .
miss , i have to ask you to put away your computers now .
excuse me ? may i have a glass of champagne ?
miss , please , open the door !
we 're gonna land soon ! open the door !
with a scar on her lower abdomen ?
how is she ?
kill her and get the pouch .
open it .
i 'm not sure i could be of any help for you .
good , good ! excellent .
i have come to the university , where i 've taken the liberty
i trust you .
so , do you think you could meet us here at the university ?
i 'm very pleased to meet you .
captain del rio .
let me introduce you to my colleagues .
i know who everyone is .
gentlemen , this is lucy , the first woman to ... i mean ...
she has abilities .
your daughter , gabrielle , age six , died in a car accident .
it 's been a while since we 've had a sit-down , hasn 't it ?
yeah , yeah . what 's going on , richard ?
that 's precisely what i 'm here to find out .
lyman , wyoming
what can i get for you boys ?
two waters , then .
don 't worry , it 's a local call .
then what ?
we had it .
i can still taste that money right there in the back of my throat .
you 're not getting that thing across the rivers
we got to move .
they got leeches , you know .
i don 't know , papi .
are you all right , buddy ?
you feel like you broke anything ?
can you get it ?
this thing 's not going anywhere .
i 'm sorry , buddy .
what were you telling me about my bike ?
i 'll go get your keys .
first is this place called blanding .
i can 't go .
well , that would certainly spare the family some embarrassment .
well , here 's a thought . we say he was at drama camp .
uh , guys , why can 't we just tell the truth ?
and it pains me to sell it .
i 've got a few deals in the pipeline .
they 're 70 % off !
hey . parker , where 's your uniform ?
no , i don 't . i quit .
but , mom , i suck !
that 's why they made up a fake position for me .
there is not a team i know that could get along without their backup far right fielder .
all right , let 's try it again .
you ready ? you can do it . here we go .
you threw it too fast . throw slower .
i ... don 't mean " love " in the swooning schoolboy sense .
shh . do you mind ?
so i am .
mm , you said that yesterday .
it 's gonna be weeks before you 'rewup and running .
you just let home come to you , okay ?
but the good news is , according to my lawyer ,
now there 's the face that i was looking for .
strike one !
his arm must be getting tired .
yeah , i " performed " for him once .
i 'll be all right . i 'm fine .
you sure ?
yeah , well , they all were .
uh , nothing .
what happened ?
well , of course not . what is it ?
when andrew was on the street ,
oh , good . i mean , i 'd hate to think he had no work ethic at all .
men hired him , uh , to ...
yard work ?
orson , you 're scaring me .
no ! nonot awful .
how sweet !
we have some catching up to do .
i know how painful this must be for you .
and why have you told me this ?
why ?
do you think i 'm an idiot ?
ive always assumed howard had some ... outlet ,
i didn 't care to know .
i just felt that if it were me . i ...
yes , absolutely .
my daughter tells me it 's common knowledge among the cheerleaders .
you are gonna chase your dream ,
crap , they 're cheering for him .
what are we gonna say to him ?
looks like a pretty bad sprain .
damn .
he had the key to their dealings
the judge asked why he was coming forward with this information .
what 's the right thing to do now , michael ?
but if i don 't give him up ,
if i 'm to live ..
i 'm still not exactly sure why we 're here , but .
a friend ?
we 're clear on where we are.everything 's under control .
my friend is a problem solver , that 's all .
do me a favour ,
you think she knows about the kid ?
we shouldn 't lie
i swear to god , it gets deeper and deeper .
it means , if i 'd have known how this was gonna turn out ,
god , that sounds good .
i 'll put a hundred in your kick every month .
i 've been in the kitchen for eight months .
hey ! fiorello , how about it ?
i was thinking about what you said
then set up a meeting with falzone .
falzone doesn 't talk to guys like you directly .
no , no .
mr quinn , mind telling us what we 're doing here ?
just think of me as a supervisor
i wasn 't aware that things were out of control .
there are only four sheriffs in the county .
watching him till they could put him in protection .
he gets lonely and calls home , a lot .
i asked for another copy .
i went online , reverse-traced the number , and voila
you scratch my back , i scratch yours .
where did you get this ?
since you took it upon yourself to have some people watch our interests on the outside ,
fibonacci or your pretty little girlfriend there ?
these walls have eyes .
and philly.before you pull the trigger ,
rat race , arms race ..
fix it .
this is not the time or the place .
remember who you are talking to .
no , actually you 're caroline reynolds from montgomery , illinois .
come with me .
i mean , i know everyone is nervous about tomorrow .
but the one thing both of us have to remember
that 's bad news for everyone .
oh , just one more thing .
of course .
and i think i 'll keep this ,
why we have breakfast every day ?
it 's an important meal .
nothing would make me happier .
why ?
susan 's need for approval aside ,
well , maybe you 'd like it better if we covered it with a gingham throw .
we honestly thought that people would like it .
shouldn 't we be worried ?
now , show me again how you kill the zombies .
and i 'd love to meet your college buddies .
no plaid pants and no women .
and to think i got you a gift .
they 're monogrammed .
you don 't even know what that means , you petulant sock puppet !
i 'm going to the store .
so that 's all settled . would you like some iced tea ?
you mean katherine 's homeowners ' thing ? yeah , i think i 'll sit this one out .
no . actually , i 'm nominating myself .
running for president in your condition ?
tom , i don 't want your opinion , just your vote .
i know one rules my life .
nothing .
this is about what kind of neighbourhood we want to live in .
now i get it . this is about you wanting to take on katherine .
well , i 'm ready !
listen , i promised tom i wouldn 't knock myself out
you know , ring some bells , talk me up , that sort of thing .
but , what ?
occasionally . why ?
i think she is .
all right , before we vote , are there any more questions for the candidates ?
it 's not a question .
what is it with you gay people and clothes ?
all right , debate 's over .
okay , and those for katherine ?
so what do we do ? it 's a tie .
did i ? well , that 's obviously wrong .
susan , we 're waiting .
her heart is not very strong .
well , knock wood . we 'd hate to see you forced to take care of a baby
danielle , you should introduce yourself .
and you 're going to learn more from their experience and wisdom
well , actually we checked into the curriculum and it 's very strong .
yes , and with a grandmother 's unconditional love ,
well , we were gonna surprise you with one for your birthday
and up , and out , and up , and out ..
you know , maybe i should go to college .
but you can 't raise this child in a miamiidorm room
i 'll say that you 're broke and needed the money .
i need something that will fly , phyllis .
we need to talk .
i think it 's time for us to do the right thing .
we have to end this affair .
from thinking about you .
from thinking about your sweet face between my legs .
i think i should go tidy up .
slow , slow , slow .
from hanging out with really nasty girls .
i hope so .
did you know that ?
tell me what you see .
this is a cynical business .
this is a s-carat stone .
who is that man who is revered ?
such a figure was unknown to the greeks , unheard of , unimaginable .
and this god is the god of the jewish people .
enough . i see your look . no more philosophy .
perhaps they are not so silent as you think .
but here they are .
this is a cautionary stone .
a cautionary diamond
isn 't that the meaning of adornment ?
is to acknowledge both her frailty , and the nobility of that frailty .
that we will not thereby be made less .
we met once for drinks at this club in dallas
women do better , don 't they ?
yeah , well , my guess is that in most cases ,
there 's a lot of smart people out there .
is on his way to the slam .
a law degree was a license to steal
i guess not .
all right .
i 'm a good fuck ?
no , they can sniff out the moral dilemma .
three , four minutes , five maybe . it depends on your collar size .
no , no , no .
it just keeps running until the noose closes completely and then ..
you can 't think , counselor . you 're in or you 're out .
don 't thank me yet .
but , money problems are serious problems .
is that your normal toast ?
so , if the drug wars stop ...
let 's just say , it will be more than risky .
you may have noticed his lifestyle has become increasingly lavish .
tn fact , a few times shared the women themselves .
now , why would you ask me that ?
but i see a murky picture forming in that mind of yours .
hey , counselor ?
no , why ?
and , counselor , here 's something else to consider .
all right .
my kid is in jail .
where
what 's he in jail for ?
son of a bitch .
he had $ 12,000 on him , but they took that off him .
what else is he charged with ?
some other stuff
what is that , " 206 " ?
that 's somebody 's weight , or a time of day .
on that tap bike of his .
he could pay the fine and get out of there .
what did you guys do ? nothing . we left .
i think what i 'm gonna do is take the wall out ..
i think that will do it .
i 'll talk to my guy and it should take two or three days .
there he is .
we don 't care what the kid is saying .
yeah . it 's not much .
i mean , she was a dancer .
then she leans down to see if i 'm watching .
and she kisses me upside down .
i thought , " i ' m losing my fucking mind . that 's what 's happening here . "
sucking its way up the glass .
probably , yeah . sometimes
i don 't know what i am .
it 's like being in love with .
i know .
i shouldn 't have told you .
you might not get it .
yes , i do .
do you know which truck it is ?
do you know how it goes ?
it seems the deceased was working for them .
and all they have to go on is that he was a client of yours .
you got him out of jail .
if you think , counselor , that you can live in this world and be no part of it ..
it 's not that you 're going down , counselor .
excuse me , ma 'am
may i please use your phone for just a minute ?
well , when was the last time you tried to call him ?
why ?
what are you going to do ?
what are you ? i don 't know .
what are you going to use for money ?
if you had any serious money , you wouldn 't be in this jackpot in the first place .
well , i know why i 'm in it . do you ?
no . you got in trouble .
no deal . now , it 's too late .
i don 't know , counselor . i don 't know
you say that like it 's my hole card .
with these guys , what would you say ?
that may be what happens .
" space . " yeah . hmm .
that 's not what greed does . that 's what greed is .
i 'll already be gone . you know that .
he 's inside , they paint it , he rides around .
he rides around some more , sucking up the shit .
yes , but i can only tell you what i already told our friend .
the tlorida is closed .
we could meet someplace .
i 'm not sure you understand my position .
actions create consequences which produce new worlds .
where the bodies are simply left to be found , that is another .
welcome to london heathrow , terminal 5 .
any unattended luggage will be removed and may be destroyed .
thank you .
so , are you planning to see him again ?
smart girl .
i don 't want to get mixed up in something heavy .
how would you know he won 't come looking for you ?
yes . thank you .
you did an excellent job .
hello ?
like i said , we 'd like to move quickly on this . i 'm gonna have to call you back .
sheldon , that is a $ 500 limited edition collectible ,
fine .
go ahead .
it smells funny in here .
what the hell are you doing ?
i 'm using it .
no , i don 't .
actually , i have a plastic baggy strapped to my leg that says i can .
you 've chosen to tangle with a superior intellect you can 't defeat .
in the way heart disease changes your life ?
they only feed this cow alfalfa , barley , and red wine ,
it 's not " the far dide . " the cow doesn 't drive anywhere .
let 's go !
what ?
that 's a thing ?
gloria 's always late .
we yell , and it just takes longer .
you know , he peed on me .
daddy , are you sad about your mom ?
why can 't i go with you ?
so grandpa palmer 's dead too ?
gotta remember to put food out for them , especially in the winter .
fan the snakes out of tndiana , and don 't ask me how
trust me , no one 's dispersing reptiles in indiana .
i was not there .
look around you .
built on the premise that you and you alone are responsible .
now , you still want fair ? all right .
tractor pulls , cotton candy ...
first week in august . you 'll love it .
you don 't have a truck
thank you , fellas . appreciate you all being here .
stop staring . i know i look good .
she and i stayed close . gee , i just saw her tuesday .
i 'm assuming you still know where the cemetery is ?
wolf it . you gotta go . surprised i am .
you 've always been my sweetheart
think either of them could ever be as good as you ?
yes , joe is hitting cleanup on varsity .
none of my business
are you crazy ? dad has been sober for 28 years .
always with the shitty old movie camera .
judge palmer 's your old man ?
your dad 's a piece of shit .
you know what ? i told you to take it easy .
who 's on probation ? who 's on parole ?
i 'm gonna be very helpful .
who 's got the felony dwi ?
and because i 'm the only one that isn 't driving with a suspended license
asshole ! throw that punch . you like county food ?
and maybe i was gonna ask you to blow on my dice .
let 's get the hell out of here .
dershowitz ?
why don 't you read my beads ?
eighty percent of hit-and-runs involve liquor .
but you need an admission from him .
fill her up .
and a " since you 're in the john anyway " sort of thing ?
we can get everything we need from a hair sample .
judge palmer , we 're gonna need to impound your vehicle .
we 're gonna have to file another continuance . what else can i do ?
yeah , i 'd love to walk out on it , but i can 't .
why the hell are you calling me , lisa ?
i believed him . i believed him
glen and i were in the backyard , tinkering with his , breaking ball .
but .
blackwell .
on her chest until he drowned her .
he got out in april .
shit-for-brains , am i speaking korean ? stop the goddamn car .
leaving the scene , blood evidence , motive .
i could convict you over coffee .
if the blood matches , and i have no reason to doubt it does
the " i don 't remember " defense doesn 't fly with a corpse .
your honor , the deadline for filing a change of venue motion ..
so unless there 's been a change in circumstance that
barring that .
this is a preliminary hearing , not a trial .
without further delay , let 's get started , gentlemen .
when i approached the victim , he was unresponsive .
he was dead , son .
and exactly what did mr. palmer tell you ?
correct .... . the night of the accident .
we can get this dismissed . it was an accident .
excuse me .
the honorable judge sanford warren presiding
jury selection will begin one week from today .
" agreement from the gipper 's coach . "
he knows the answer , yet he asks .
jet 's hold some court . yeah .
now , peacefully , easily ...
why do you think dickham missed the filing deadline ..
oh , he didn 't miss the deadline . it 's a small town .
one loves you , one hates you .
pretty obvious that dickham had no intention of filing . he wants the trial here
couldn 't live with himself if his lack of experience cost the case . so ..
there 's no route from the mini-mart home where that makes sense
okay .
the road home was washed out , where it dips near the old mill .
then .
bumper stickers ? anybody got one on their car , truck , rv ?
and what do they read ? exact words , please
they never got him on a felony .
i missed you , baby . it 's gonna be such a fun weekend .
lauren .
okay .
you 're my little sweetheart . i 'll show you the house . come on .
in fact , you 're the first girl in this family in a long time .
yeah , he isn 't . but i 'm glad you see it that way .
that 's super comfy . there you go . you want a second pillow ?
good . now put your head down .
and now ..
he 's sure . i 'm wondering if you 're sure .
why did we come here ?
what do you think you know ?
that i 'm a decent guy ? that i 'm loyal ?
what do you know ?
here 's what i know :
lock the door behind you .
and i made out with your daughter .
it 's called " chemo brain . "
confusion , dementia , delusions .
i may need you to testify .
i don 't think he wants anyone knowing
when will he be done with the treatments ?
on him ?
how would he know
come on .
what ?
i don 't know . fixing the sink .
can i help ? she 'll slip . there 's too much water .
all right , go do something . grandpa and i will be down in a minute .
well , we 'll figure it all out , baby .
then it happened to katlin .
me neither .
i 'm just gonna let you drive home . you 're doing great .
so when you see mom , what are you supposed to say ?
hey . thanks .
you will be fine . you 're something else .
best vacation ever .
that 's what that was .
june , july , august , september , october , november ... the fuck ?
sir , i appreciate the primer in dna evidence analysis .
when determining if it 's mark blackwell 's blood on the car ?
didn 't take a swing at mr. blackwell ?
use profanity , rant , rave , flip him off
dr. brannamon , you found something else in his system at the time of death ?
he was dead , but mr. shaw had to live here
he could have refused the case easily , but he believed in the aw .
most decent man i ever met
because carla 's father was never gonna be her father .
there was no wabash river float trip . there was no everclear and kool-aid
what lies you gonna tell me ?
that
like you always do .
oh , my god , you 're nuts .
okay ? i 'm asking you now .
dad cannot go to prison .
dad wants to see you , hank .
come here .
don 't ever say that again , to anybody .
you 're speculating . i know you too .
i don 't have the energy to fight with you , henry .
that only you were allowed to drive that car .
it 's my car .
but you don 't know how it got there .
that 's a pretty big old boy , on a steel bicycle .
objection . asked and answered .
you see a man that you hate , and minutes later ...
and both you and that man are on the same road at the same time
i do not .
under oath , which i know you understand better than most
who drowned a 16-year-old girl
my little boy .
wanted to put my arms around him and tell him it didn 't have to be like this .
like i 'd want someone to help my boy ..
it was my chance to be .
maybe so . maybe so .
of us .
then i don 't .
why ?
your honor , may the deputy please approach ?
she was born nine months after i split .
one version is slightly less not fine than the other .
god , this is ugly .
he 's her father .
and you never came back !
damn it , hank
the most selfish and the most generous person i know .
what say you in the matter of the state of indiana v. joseph palmer ...
we find the defendant not guilty .
we find the defendant guilty .
this case has been a most tragic occurrence ..
but as you know all too well , sir
sentence is to begin forthwith .
order
thirty-five percent can .
less than 1 percent knows the name thurgood marshall .
something just south of brilliance happens .
six weeks we prepped burke 's mistress for the infamous hank palmer cross .
i did ?
you lose .
stick with it .
you look good . you warm enough ?
knock it off .
hey , have you and howard
nothing soothes those pre-wedding jitters
he hasn 't told her yet .
i was thinking of weaving it into her eulogy .
well , when you say it like that you make it sound creepy .
howard 's mother had a heart attack
nice of you to come for howard .
i 'm sorry , did i miss something ?
ugh .
the blood of all other classes !
mini stalin , dead ahead .
as she would tell you herself , she 's the hottest girl in school .
i would totally bang the shit out of her .
anupam and lena , where are we on the school-lunch article ?
but you 're missing the meat of the story .
now , that 's a school-lunch story . boom .
we came up with that idea together , but mostly me
you wanna do your thing
you don 't have to do that . " no , you didn 't . i didn 't say ... "
and i thank you .
yeah , that 's not where i was going with that .
i know it sucks , but maybe it 's the universe
everything and everyone can suck it .
ho , ho . well , that 's easy for you to say .
although jess ' menu of dudes was never-ending
i couldn 't work up the courage to say three words to toby .
okay. bye .
whoo ! we 're gonna kick some ass !
you know those people you grow up with ,
hey , neighbor .
saw you watching some weird japanese horror movie last night .
a , don 't leave your curtains open ,
who wants to know ?
mm , wesley , you wouldn 't be in my life
speaking of stones , rock-hard abs .
no , no one wants that .
caitlyn .
really ? with this ? does she have to film everything ?
my life is an audition for reality tv .
hey , caitlyn , take five .
okay , but her friends are super hot .
guys can be duf f 's too , okay ?
we 're in chemistry together .
shouldn 't you be working with a partner ?
lab partner 's got this .
bill nye over there looks like she 's about to drink that acid .
you know , i should be mad at you . you ruined my favorite shirt .
it 's just that stands for designated ugly fat friend , dick face .
i mean , the duff doesn 't actually have to be fat or ugly .
it 's not like he rides a horse , right ?
i 'm just saying , i would never call anyone fat or ugly .
home . wasn 't feeling good .
yeah , except jess making out with ryan jensen ,
yeah , just get the food .
is there a problem ?
our what ? your designated ugly fat friend .

wes had made me see the school differently ,
even if you weren 't in a group , like creepy carrie raskowitz .

we both like thai food ,
that dress is beautiful on you .
wes gave it to me .

you were at my special place .
youl said i could use it .
you were on a date with toby .
i thought we were friends .
you know , people like you don 't hang out
i don 't know why i thought it could be different .
okay ?
this was an experiment ,
please , just go home .
the word " homecoming " itself
i know some people will
i don 't know about you ,
so all of this because of some word
but , you know , you 're wrong
wow , that is an interesting dress .
since you can 't seem to leave my boyfriend alone ,
ifine , i will .

hey , i talked to her for five minutes yesterday
my head , what about yours ?
my head is her summer house .
the locus of my identity is totally exterior to me .
i mean , do you know where i was all morning ?
did you get the part ?
you want to talk about not getting love from a parent .
yeah , you grabbed your penis and wouldn 't let go .
of course she did .
when i was ten years old , i built a hugging machine .
oh , that is so sad .
my father used to borrow it .
you have a remarkable brain .
although i 've always hated
nothing 's ever big enough .
then you never hear the end of it .
oh , i 'll send you a link ,
your unwillingness to accept empirical evidence
i 've been living with your son too long .
i feel very comfortable around you , too .
nor i .
is that a rhetorical point
i 'd like that , too .
you 're gonna lick the salt ... off my neck .
you want your son to see his next birthday ?
get mine back .
why are they getting us involved in this ?
tyler , something 's wrong . hold your position .

heil hitler , everyone .

if i tell on you , you 'll be in big trouble ,
and if you tell my mother i know , then she 'll kick you out ,
so , it 's a mexican stalemate .
i have some conditions for allowing you to stay here .
besides , it 's for the book .
i 'm sorry . did i make it weird ?
it shouldn 't be weird between us .
it 's fine . i 'm just tired . i 'm going to bed .
why don 't we go upstairs and see , yes ?
no . i think she 's in town .
she is quite busy .
well , i 'm pleased to see that you 're wearing your ...
but not the one your father gave you ?
i wish , sir , with your help ,
i bring your attention to the matter of the instrument .
it was given to me by my father 's lawyer .

you know that of course .
there is a difference between them and s
you see , annabel , we 're not your enemy .
it 's almost as if you wanted it to happen .
you know you can 't save him ,
the clock is ticking
just thought you needed to know that .
i can understand why you don 't trust us .
men who trusted you died ,
all those lives ,
why we do what we do ?
but i always come back to the same answer .
make the world a safer place .
move your queen .
the figure is correct .
it has come to him
but tell me , why should i trust you ?
it is unclean money , sir .
my father .
whose sins do you renounce
and your own sins ?
you must choose the path of allah .
i am satisfied , mr. brue , that his offer is genuine .
this is a list of charities , with their banking details ,
i did , and this time i want it to mean something
they 're all clean .
you 're looking at me , at us ,
we make the weather .
uh , we become their friends .
when they 're ours , and only then ,
over the past few weeks ...
i 'm sure you 've noticed that my behavior has been ...
hmm , just in the .. clinical sense .
i don 't want there to be any more tension between us .
ohi didn 't dive . i .... just dropped my keys .
let me play poker with you and the girls .
maybe you and mike can have me over for a barbecue sometime .

and this time i mean it .
stealing susan 's jewelry
how about a man whose wife 's taking him to the cleaners ,

let 's not forget who had no problem
i am even less proud of letting my libido blind me to the fact
wait .
will you marry me ?

you just wanted mike over here to try to seduce him .
you have the most suspicious mind .
even i 'm getting turned on .
i do that every night .
why would you do something that stupid ?
i 'm failing it .
we can 't afford to have you fail .

that . that was taken at a reception in london

quite by accident , i find myself in a rather ... criminal position .
i suppose not . but how thrilling to be forging pieces of paper that go where ?
no , i am selling to collectors .
i don 't know why i told you .
i should have gone out there and gotten a rock and told the rock ,
you 're not the only one without friends .
we broke up . she was a pain in my ass .
because she wanted things .
i don 't suppose you dance ?
like buying groceries or securing shelter .

just in case , who should we look out for ?
i 'd stay away from him .

and if they want me to be a witness .
but you 're gonna pay me $ 5,000 .

that is so sweet .
nice dress .
the guys have been helping me set up my sound system .
alicia is an actress , just like you .
well , trying to be , but it 's so hard .
i 've been out here three months ,
i 'm holding out for the right part .
whatever you think is best , cutie .
okay .
i don 't even know why i care .
all right , i cared enough to memorize that stupid joke , but that 's all i care .
occasionally ,
what are you saying , that i 'm threatened by alicia ?
i 'm just talking about bees .
what are you talking about ?
i just got that physicist joke .
yeah , what 's the occasion ?
did you remember to ask for the chicken
brown rice , not white ? yes .
yes .
good .
so , what do we got going on tonight , huh ?
what can i say ? i got my geek on , boys .
oh , thank god you 're home . i need help. what 's wrong ?
oh , i 'd watch that .
and i have to be at universal in 45 minutes .
oh , you 're a lifesaver .
great .
oh , actually , that 's okay. we already have ...
.. chinese food right here .
i cannot believe they 're letting her just use them like that .
you know that just last week ,
last year , the 74th hunger games
but we had so little time to revel in their joy .
she 's done , she 's lovely . we must feed the monster .
let 's go to district 12
anyone at home ?
sorry , caesar .
it 's your day . so how 's it going ?
that 's it ? that 's all we get ? " we 're good " ?
for myself ,
can he do that ?
thank you .
he could have killed me
come on .
in all my years , i 've never seen ...
i never meant for anyone to get killed .
i 'm sorry . i didn 't know what to do .
well , i have family , too .
what about them ? who protects them ?
i was thinking about rue .
it 's a little overwhelming .
so are you having fun ?
thought that was what happened to seneca crane . too much fun .
decided
then why are you here ?
why ?
the chance to make the games mean something
the presidential welcome
you think we convinced him ?
tonight
and i , personally , want to congratulate them
and i know it will go on inspiring us
she 's not who they think she is .
think that 's true
i agree she should die . but in the right way .
it 's moves and counter-moves . and it 's all we gotta look at .
they think she 's one of them .
we don 't need to destroy her . just the image .
what do you propose ?
take away what little they have .
what 's the cake gonna look like ? executions .
blanket coverage . shove it in their faces .
brilliant
into the woods . like we always talked about .
you haven 't hurt people , katniss .
they just have to be brave enough to take it .
we have to go , gale , before they kill us .
go ahead
no , you don 't want to shoot her .
look , commander , you 're new here .
tt means we have to save him .
come on , haymitch .
nobody ever wins the games . period
fpeeta has to survive .
all right , if
if he 's trying to protect her in any way , it exposes him .
i bet when it really comes down to it , he won 't protect her .
she 's actually a wonderful lady .
i mean , it 's supposed to be for the horses , but .
they got years to eat sugar , whereas you and i .
no thanks . but i would love to borrow that outfit someday .
what about you , girl on fire ?
i 'm an open book .
unfortunately , i think that 's true .
have a good day .
to know all my secrets .
tributes , mount up .
i want you to look straight ahead
press this when you 're ready .
i guess we just try to figure out who we trust least
heat generates fire . in theory .
a little brute force ... is always helpful .
by the corner of the table .
no . next to him .
thank you ! thank you !
we have never seen anything like this .
because tonight , on this stage ,
our final opportunity to express our love .
now , katniss ,
i can 't make any promises . you know me .
i love her ! the girl on fire is so cheeky .
i think we 're all here a little disappointed ,
alas . but am i correct in assuming
president snow , as usual , was right .
i love it ! i love it !
it 's incredible . it 's so gorgeous .
take a bow
in secret .
all right . do tell .
you know , katniss and i
if it weren 't for the baby .
someday i want to ove someone that much .
hang on .
it 's a dome . we 're at the edge of the arena .
it 's gonna get dark soon .
take turns sleeping . i can take first watch .
it 's over . it 's okay . they 're gone .
prim ! find prim !
prim ! ind prim ! no , no . prim 's okay .
no , no . prim 's okay .
yeah , i 'm fine . i 'm fine .
your fiance 's right . the whole country loves your sister .
hey , how does that sound , snow ?
you know , you can 't put everybody in here .
lightning strikes that tree .
we leave the beach at dusk . we head to the lightning tree .
prior to midnight we then run this wire from the tree to the water .
will be electrocuted
i assure you , it won 't burn up .
yeah , why not ?
all right , i say we try it
that would be extremely helpful .
this plan 's gonna work .
and once the careers are dead , we both know what happens next .
what if they don 't either ?
maybe not . i mean , it worked for us last time .
you know and i know that there 's only one person walking out of here .
the careers are still out there .
this is what you predicted .
in the meantime , make yourself comfortable
typically a lightning strike
you two girls , go together now .
make sure the entire coil is in the water . youl understand ?
we 'll meet you there .
no , no , no . you 're staying here to protect me .

isn 't there any other way to contact him ?
so everyone knows . hit it .
i know , and people eat it up .
don 't say that . we made a difference .
you made sure the doors are locked , right ?
he 's also re-wrapped his face in bandages .
why ?
as if he 's become consumed by his dark side .
it must have been impossible to resist the compulsion .
you know you can 't just bring in harvey and be done with it .
the mutants .

but you seem to have this issue with stacee jaxx .
well .
when i was a naive undergrad at ucla ,
one night she was partying innocently at the bourbon room ...
and lured her into his suite at the park hyatt .
but lately he seems more like a ...
but the biggest danger is
ha-ha-ha . okay . that was funny .
walked away with virtually all of the night 's proceeds . "

hey ! you ! mrs. mayor !
you lot need to feel the wind of change .
it says here we operated on her back in ' 99 .
and resist the anti-smoking lectures .
so , do you think , if they put a picture of these
it 's chronic . means i have it all the time .
what pain are you having ?
it 's like a thousand samurai warriors
so maybe we 'll start you on morphine .
so what do you want to talk about , agent self ?
i never been on the top of someone else 's hit list .
if this company hit man wyatt
we 've been searching for the link between
if scofield and burrows are working with the government ,
and if don self is the head of the snake ..
my fee just doubled , by the way .

i 'm gonna snap his neck .
yeahyeah , and in the meantime , what ? in the elevator ?

you can 't . here .
i know .
so , what are you hearing , uh , scylla is worth , huh ?

you 'd better back up .
papers i wrote as a child .
is this like a diary ?
really your potty training journal ?
you feeling a little better ?
one sec .
i need you to go to my house .

roughly 14 stories high .
i 'll leave the door unlocked .
so let 's talk about what you can do for me .

and i know steadman had a lot of money .
then what were you doing in that garage last night ?
honestly , linc , i don 't know how it 's come to this .
difference is , i got out .
what did you do with your half , linc ?
i hope for your sake that 's true .
trust me , that won 't be a problem .
we need the public behind us if we want the death penalty .
i brought you a gift from the hospital !

you like helping yourself .
oh , my god .
well , do something !
the whiskey that you ordered , sir will be here in a couple of days .

i particularly have no love for the desert donkeys ,
i understand that , sir .
what i 'm saying is , what i saw was wrong
a to b. that 's it .
yeah . and he also taught me to look inside .
a to b , your call .
they didn 't even let her testify .
anyone asking questions ?
i can 't remember the last time i was this much of a nervous wreck .
secluded , no real access roads perfect for what you 're looking for .

eric , this is our sweetness and ligot
but at the same time
great stand-up tits .
to a meeting somewhere ? to your office ?
what do you do exactly ?
i think you 're dedicated to knowing
a visionary .
it 's a credible threat , not to be dismissed
i 'm still standing here .
no need to go cross town
i mean there 's reason to believe
yes i know . it always has .
all these limos , my god ,
or some dumb wedding wherever .
something i need to apologize for ?
you now what today is ? incidentally .
but we have to give the word a little leeway .
because money has taken a turn .
there 's no other kind of enormous wealth .
i want this car , which i love
i understand none of this .
does it slow down ?
it 's fantastic .
look at those numbers running .
it used to be the other way around .
people stopped thinking about eternity
it 's cyber-capital that created the future .
ten to the minus nine power .
because time is a corporate asset now .
the present is harder to find .
the future becomes insistent .
the urge to destroy is a creative urge .
ienforced destruction .
new markets have to be forcibly claimed
this is the thing about genius .
there 's been a threat , then .
an incursion is already in progress .
now we have to act now on what we know .
we were under attack by anarchists .
now , what , forgotten .
that 's my peanuts you smell .
is that the hote you wanted to take me to ?
we 'll do it in the ladies room .
i 'm trying to make contact in the most ordinary ways .
this is important .
i understand this at some level
how they smell .
you have to see a doctor .
you just saw a doctor .
packer capital 's portfolio
and there 's been a credible threat at my life .
free to do what
i 'll truly do what i can to help .
at your pace , in your way .
we don 't have a name .
the complex is analyzing the voice data .
why can 't i work up any curiosity on the subject ?
hope you 're not disappointed .
that our man here wasn 't shot !
natural causes ,
let a fine machine degrade in public .
everything 's a scandal .
think i 'm hearing voices in the night .
because i can 't believe you 're saying this .
me being big as i am and a retro-nigger .
he liked having the clergy nearby .
i woke up this morning and knew it was time .
i said to myself :
s0 , you married that woman ?
that her family has got like money
4a man is hit one day by another taxi .
i mean he was flying in the air ,

i had a little fan that worked on battery ,
i had my steering wheel upholstered ,
ii give this guy his first haircut
i want to kill you
you 're not a reflective man .
give me a cigarette .
i 'm thinking of installing a shooting range in my apartment .
line them up and shoot them .
youl 've been in the office
maybe if you 'd tell me your name .
i know names more than faces .
benno jevin .
that 's a phony name .
it 's fake , it isn 't real .
but , not an interesting one .
it is possible , because i don 't keep track ,
and herein lies my sickness .
i 'm talking about you .
why are you here ?
i noticed the toilet .
what happens to your waste ?
doubts that you could never acknowledge .
i know you smoke cigars .
i know what i see in your face

a hundred things a minute .
i have syndromes where they 're real ,
they have the time and
there 's nothing in the world
it was the thought of my life .
it 's " buy and sell . "
the importance of the lopsided .
you were looking for balance , beautiful balance ,
but you should have been tracking the yuan
don 't you ever walked through the park behind the library
that 's from holding in my anger all those years .
you have to die , no matter what .
i have my syndromes ,
taking a giant knit in front of our shop .
it 's been chained here for , like , four months .
maybe it is our bike .
max , that was a great idea .
i know .
get around some people .
i 'm talking about us doing deliveries .
speak for yourself . i 've delivered .
max , i have good news and bad news .
and the good news is ..
don 't toy with me , woman .
did you find a new apartment ?
last time i was told to close my eyes ,
oh , you 're dating a clown ?

i was gonna give you the world .
the current never touches people , pets , plants .
although , uh , in the spirit of full disclosure ,
you ...
we can bring clean energy to everyone .
flag anyone fleming could be in business with .
look , i am not just some frightened girl
i can hack any system , and i can do it fast .
and don 't tell me i can 't do it because i know i can .
i 've had a taste . i want more .
you know , i once saw a really fat baby
also , it 's implied that you 're coming
mm-hm . yeah .
we cannot tail him in this .
they 're headed north out of town .
there 's nothing out here but a rock quarry .
i 'll circle until you signal .

this kid in my neighborhood ,
is that what you remember or is that what you were told ?
i took a position with a group of multinationals we call the company .
thing is , if you wanted to rise in the ranks like i did ,
information people would do a lot of things to get their hands on ,
why didn 't you reach out to us ?
i regretted it every day , but i didn 't have a choice .
that 's why they 're doing this to you .
look , don 't know what 's going on .

what is the party line , boss ?
i 've got a new toothbrush , miss !
things are pretty stretched around here until we get the new di position filled .
so , you 'll effectively be acting inspector , without the remuneration of course .
there 's really nothing more seductive to a woman than power .

they will tell you a load of shite .
if you 're no ' fucking the woman you 're with , it opens this ...
excuse me , bruce . i have to spend a penny .
will it be the usual , brother robertson ?
i 'll see you at my place on the weekend then .
aye .
i wouldn 't normally ask with something so trivial ,
and another little brownie point for the promotion , brother robertson .
i understand how unsettling these prank calls must be to you ,

so i need you to indulge him a little bit .
ah , bruce , i hear you have a pain , yes ?

some nasty little bastard has written something which ,
it 's silly .
i 'm going straight to toal .

what he gets up to privately is his own business .
this bullying ... this bullying has to stop .
party games . gather round .

you disgust me . get your face off my cock !

oh , come on , bruce .
it 'd just be a compromise .
in some parts of the country the force even advertise in the gay press now .
this is scotland , by christ !
in a sense we 're always together , because nothing .
here are your drinks , sir .
but heterosexual anal sex need not imply an attitude of misogyny .
bruce , i was only telling you what the article said .
it 's all fucking bullshit cos i read this article , proper , medical .
so where does that leave them ?

of course i do .
but , you know , sometimes you get bored ,
i know . it 's terrible , but i can 't change it now .

no , that 's all right . let him rest .
he 's a good man .
no , thanks . i 'm all caught up on that .
let me guess .
when i was 13 , my dad caught my mom having an affair , and he walked out on us .

sonny blew up the science wing . it was so cool .

weather patterns . very strange weather patterns .

what happened to your shirt ?
well , an aspiring , very stuck writer at the moment .
al the horrors in the world can 't compare to the terrors of the blank page .
well , first rule of writing : write what you know .
and somehow you figured out how to finish it in one night .
hey , my bro and friend .
max , your boyfriend is here .
he 's just another guy who likes my cupcakes .
well , your face gets red when you see him ,
he doesn 't know what love is .
and if they looked like that. we wouldn 't call them rapists .
johnny !

no way . let 's get out of here .
and besides , you need this money .
there might be stuff here they don 't want

it 's unsettling , and i 'm obsessed with it .

i 'm sorry . where ?
which papers ?
oh , my god . i love this !
and next thing you know you 're an old lady in a rest home ,
why didn 't you kiss him ?
max , stop hoarding your feelings .
i like him .
awesome .
on ebay we could get at least three to six dollars for it .
it 's a possum , and it died at least three to six years ago .
this is a katherine heigl movie .
oh , hello . sorry to interrupt you ,
no problem .
well , it was the two of you who found amy farrah fowler for me .
y-you sure you 're up for that ? she did hurt you .
i think of my time with amy as a stick of fruit stripe gum :
i-i was always a hubba bubba man . mm .
hey , the jaw wants what it wants .
oh , right , uh , girlfriend .
all i 'm looking for is an educated , intelligent woman
isn 't that a little unreasonable ?
now , chop-chop .
okay .
i don 't think any of your comfort zones are showing .
well , some people think the sexiest organ is the brain .
do you have any heels higher than this ?
ooh , tall !
yeah , come on , tell us more .
what more do you need ?
just a little peck on the lips .
fine . um ...
all right , that is a juicy one .
tea and basketball ?
oh , nice .
good luck .
hey , you want to swing by that place tonight
i 'll just call the restaurant ,
yeah , but i 'm little , so it 's adorable .
are you sure ?
and you 're afraid it 'll do a better job than you ?
no one does a better job pretending to be a person than i do .
if you don 't want to use dating websites ,
uh , prospective women weed themselves out
wel ... if she can solve them ,
this is fun . i haven 't dated much since my divorce .
if you don 't mind me asking ,
it reminded me too much of her .
hey . so , where are they ?
oh , damn it , we should have brought binoculars .
we just happen to have those in the car ?
by stalking them ?
let 's get back to you .
i 'm trying not to .
no , but i 've followed his work for years .
you 've got to tell me about him .
he really seems into her .
i forgot how much fun this is .
can we go catch the movie ?
i had to ; we 're married now .
i 'm sorry , just one more question about sheldon .
um. about an hour and half .
yes . yep . we were on a date .
i doubt it was like this one .
what was the rest of your question ?
really ?
no . i changed my mind .
oh ! i don 't know what to do .
i really have to go to the bathroom .
37 minutes left until the deadline .
and no matter what happens ,
we really have led full lives .
maybe you don 't want someone exactly like you .
well , by that logic ,
you know , i once drove 500 miles
really ? wasn 't it great ?
well , the next time you watch it ,
that 's , um , terrific .
oh , gosh . sorry , i 've just spent the whole night

you thought she was great in x-men .
i need a second to make a call
you 've got a payphone outside , you 've got five minutes .
i can come back and i can pay you back .
son of a bitch .
i take some of this .
excuse me .
ciao , sweetie .
you didn 't forget , which means you probably love me .
you can prove it by singing me " happy birthday , " loudly .
you can leave a message after the beep .
now slide it over here .
not unless i have to , all right ?
i see you 've read the report .
it 's a type of brain cancer and it 's spread to your lungs .
three months , possibly five .
i 'm afraid not .
thank you , doctor .
but now that you 're no longer operational ,
the cia thanks you for your service .
i 'm so happy to finally meet you .
this is my wife , teresa . my son abbate .
these are my cousins . they are visiting us from mali .
do you know saint denis ?
and it is good that you are finally back . my name is jules .

look , i 'm not mad at you , all right ?
come on , zoe , let 's go to the cafe .
all right , but my bike 's coming with me .
who exactly do you work for , vivi ?
i was looking for the wolf .
wait a minute .
you know , the test results .
because you weren 't worth the cost of treatment .
you weren 't . but now you are .
because you 're sick and dead men have nothing to lose .
i need you to find him ...
so i buy back my life by killing for you ?
jesus christ , i just wanna be sure that we 're talking about the same thing here .
i think maybe we got off on the wrong foot . my fault .
let 's start again .
you are a very rude man to sit behind my desk
because i don 't want to kill a total stranger .
you are sitting in my chair .
the albino sent you , huh ? bastard !
these your girls in the picture ? how dare you look at them ? !
father to father , your girls ever
put wigs on and shit like that ?
i knew ic ! i 'm in trouble .
the longer i was gone .
that 's all . it 's nothing to do with you .
yes , of course .
i lie a lot . like , all the time about everything
last game i scored two goals , by the way .
yeah , yeah , definitely , yeah .
yeah .
i won 't be home late , ethan
great , well , i 'm headed that direction myself .

i don 't like being called that .
it 's my business to read people .
what are you saying ?
hey , i love you !
the accountant checked out . i need you to tell me where he is now .
i know you did .
i 'm suddenly a single dad . it 's getting complicated .
you 're right , mitat . it is affecting my judgment .
hey , my wife works late . i need to pick up my girls at 4 : 30 .
open up .
fine , asshole .
it 's the name of a great man who didn 't shoot us when he could
the name is perfect .
hugh asked me to go to the prom .
she knows
the same way i love you .
oh , god .
wow , sweetheart . what a good idea . here .

manny roasts his own beans every friday night .
can i just say thank you again for letting us stay here ?
hley , mom .
what pimple ?
i can 't go looking like this .
not at this one .
yeah .
men don 't have spa days .
do they serve cucumber water at that place ?
i guess we can just drop me off at a coffee shop ,
actually , i really need to wake up .
please .
a great , sweet , gorgeous , cool-ass guy .
i just want you to be careful .
it might attract some desperate characters .
come outside . then , you 're in it .
hey .
is that right ?
spin .
" when your poor amy has a cold ..
a few years ago , you 'd have known .
year one , the traditional gift was paper .
what did you get her ?
okay .
how long have you two been here ?
yeah , i was a writer . we were both writers .
my mom got sick .
she 's dead .
she 's from iew york
that can make you crazy if you 're not like that .
speaking of which , amy 's blood type ?
you don 't know if she has friends , you don 't know what she does all day .
sure you all are married ?
well , we have our first clue .
no , don 't . you 've been up all night .
hey , be careful today , okay ?
well , when you 're upset , you bottle up . you can seem angry , like ...
i 'm detective boney .
we played tennis yesterday , nick . i just can 't get over it .
i knew you never should have moved back here .
but we are all here now . and we will find amy , together .
louder !
lease come forward
i 'm rand elliott . my wife , marybeth elliott .
amy is our only child .
she really is amazing amy .
who grew up with her and care about her .
and we just want her back .
she forged a successful career in journalism .
their money , technically .
everything else is just background noise .
yeah , i just wanted to shoot some folks .
laptop-ing
you don 't trust me . you don 't trust my judgment .
what are you talking about ?
why are you throwing that in my face again ?
nick , i don 't get it .
i 'm not that person . i 'm your wife .
i just don 't know how to do this . i 've never not had a job .
bye , dad .
and then , we heard from go .
stage 4 breast cancer .
i don 't mind
but i don 't know if he 's happy i 'm with him .
something to be jettisoned , if necessary .
i feel like i could disappear .
i saw you on tv .
i called you a hundred times . you gotta pick up your phone !
my sister 's asleep in the other room .
i know this is a bad idea .
i do love you , but we have to be really careful right now .
" and dedicated to the proposition that all men .. "
she was reported missing .
she wanted a gun .
she said it needed to be small , so she could keep it close .
you don 't forget a girl like that in here .
it was valentine 's day .
that is how crazy i 've become .
in his mind , i 'm the owner of his bar , his only line of credit .
it 's so fucking small .
how did you even meet her ?
i thought writers hated cliches .
" boo-hoo , i got laid off . i guess i 'll fuck a teenager . "
just coming home , knowing she would be sitting there
boney found a pair of panties in my office .
are they super-twat 's ?
on the show today we have defense attorney , tanner bolt ,
well , let me just say ..
but of course , i 'd defend nick dunne .
i 'm so sick of being picked apart by women .
innocent until proven guilty .
go home , nick .
i can 't believe we haven 't arrested this guy .
why are you going so easy on him ? you got a crush ?
she was trying to buy a gun .
give me the update .
i talked to the nurses who care for hick 's father .
hey .
i didn 't buy any of this stuff
i like the robot dog .
we need to find out who did this !
gone .
nick dunne took my pride and my dignity
that 's murder .
to fake a convincing murder , you have to have discipline .
secretly create some money troubles .
with the help of the unwitting ...
generic . cheap . pay cash .
and america loves pregnant women .
so evidently , he 's a vinyl hipster who loves fetish manga .
who talks football and endures buffalo wings at hooters .
and for him , i 'll admit , i was willing to try .
i drank canned beer watching adam sandler movies .
i blew him semi-regularly .
i was fucking game .
nick teased out of me things i didn 't know existed .
but i made him smarter . sharper .
we were happy pretending to be other people .
and what 's the point of being together if you 're not the happiest ?
he became someone i did not agree to marry .
then he dragged me , penniless , to the navel of this great country ..
so sweet .
i clipped it on a bathroom cabinet .
let me guess .
no , you don 't seem like much of a talker .
so , what 's the plan ?
she is telling the perfect story .
and if we decide to go with your version of . the truth .
make them stop seeing her as america 's sweetheart .
now , that is a huge realignment . we 'll need other voices besides yours .
there 's a new york guy . o 'hara , tommy o 'hara .
that should be easy to find .
could you walk me through what happened ?
we click . she 's perfect .
i think , " what 's the catch ? "
spoiled rich girl , married a cheating asshole .
the only secret was her husband . we never met nick .
why was that , noelle ? why do you think ?
because he had a violent temper .
he knew i 'd have seen right through him .
i 'm not saying it 's okay he killed her .
fuck , yeah .
and she was so innocent .
thanks for coming on .
nick keeps his father , who has alzheimer 's , in a facility .
oh , fuck !
these two spend their days in the bar amy bought them .
what the fuck ?
and so , we close with a question .
to vanish without the heavens hearing our outraged cries ?
amy elliott dunne , we care about you , and we will not forget .
missouri has the death penalty .
i 'd like to report some strange activity
mr. dunne .
i know you . i saw you at the volunteer center .
i hope you don 't mind me coming by .
everything
did you treat her bad ? did you cheat on her ?
she dumped you , you completely unraveled .
and you attempted suicide in her bed and were institutionalized .
i thought there might be another side to this story .
hey , rhonda .
why did he go to his dad 's house to burn it ?
why didn 't he make sure it actually burned ?
blood in the house , credit cards , life insurance .
now , the treasure hunt is critical .
and she leaves clue number one for the police ...
which is a place where andie and i would often ..
clue two .
another place where andie and i would occasionally have relations .
we need to be on the front end of that
they can 't do that , can they ?
in all likelihood , she knows that you killed amy .
well , what are we going to do ?
no . any other strategy is missing the point .
i 'll put them on it .
where would amy go ?
are we keeping score ?
i thought we were steering clear of men for a while .
because he wants to fuck you .
it could go so wrong
you haven 't heard from her in three days .
people are gonna hate me .
a guy admitting that he 's a gigantic asshole on television ?
why don 't we just put out a statement ? they need to see you .
she is a crusader . if she takes you on as a cause
what to say , what not to say .
a trained monkey who doesn 't get the lethal injection .
they need to like you .
knowing you were out there .
let 's go to the police . you can explain everything
is it wrong to want nick to go to prison ?
i 'm setting you up at my lake house .
why are you so good to me ?
my name is andie fitzgerald .
when he was my creative writing teacher at mill valley .
i am deeply ashamed ..
the girl with the giant cum-on-me tits .
now , she looks like a fucking mennonite .
no , it is not .
my prayers go out to everyone who loves amy .
that love ended today .
fe met our trust with lie after ie .
nick is involved in the disappearance of our daughter .
this just got very exciting
nothing has changed . everything has changed .
so i pretended to be better than i was .
that guy who works harder .
and loves with as much passion as she does .
will you look in the lens
what would you like to say to her , nick ?
you 're the best person i 've ever known .
i love you .
here .
what does it say ?
oh , my god . you fucking killed it .
they 're going crazy for you .
and now they love me .
he 's certainly earned mine .
gall tanner
is that what this is about ?
i gave you the benefit of the doubt over and over .
i thought , " maybe he 's just stupid . "
none of chat is mime .
those are nice clubs . you got the makings of a real man cave .
i doubt that , but i don 't know .
sure .
okay , i know .
big as a two-by-four , right ? big as a club .
we didn 't know what the hell it was , but fire in july ?
've never seen that before either .
so , finally , nicholas dunne .
do not say another word .
nick !
when you went to place the puppets there ..
nick and credit cards
now , may i go back to where i was being held prisoner .
please continue , ms dunne .
every night .
shave me .
there were cameras everywhere .
she slit his throat with a box cutter .
if he had her tied up the whole time ?
amy , we found your diary .
well , it 's the ugly truth .
he has a temper . we had money problems .
then why did you try to buy a gun ?
my husband would be on death row .
do you feel safe going home with your husband ?
amy dunne is home .
all right , you can stop pretending now .
the nick i saw on tv , that 's the nick i fell in love with .
that 's how well you know me .
i need to make sure you 're not wearing a wire .
i 'm a fighter .
you killed a guy .
i can 't believe that fucking spider is america 's sweetheart .
she told you once before .
i swear , you two are the most fucked-up people i 've ever known .
you and amy under the same roof ?
amy dunne , and the miracle on the mississippi .
we 've had our dark days .
for supporting us in our new life together , for forgiving nick
amazing amy and the humbled husband .
take care of this guy , will you ?
you are not at risk anymore .
honey ?
not the entire time , but on and off throughout .
it 's fantastic .
" fantastic " is a little flippant .
i need you to admit that you 20t the credit cards
you have to own this , nick .
hick
that will be $ 1.10 , or a penny a bullet .
maybe we could settle up this account
oh , i see . it 's okay when you break the rules .
there is an enormous distinction
and he 's right . you stink .
he was trying to help .
he says not to be riding him for at least two days .
your bottom is bleeding .
i always pull the first bullet out of a man 's posterior pro bono .
now , if you just let me patch up that wound ,
you cut a man 's breeches ?
no one understands
well , mrs. taylor , assembling the drive in that old windmill ,
i 'll just be a moment ,
can i offer you a splash of my best scottish tea ?
we specifically agreed that i was to sell the dry goods
you just need a shear pin , all right ?
what kind of trousers can we order for you today ,
that butcher up there cut my pants , on pro bono .
what the hell kinda general store is this ?
i specifically ordered tin nails and they sent me tin snails .
you could use your nose , for all i care .
that 's right .
i reckon so .
eleven .
decades , even . ain 't that right ?
is it true you 're proposing a gunfight today , with jack ?
showdown with the montana kid ! right here in barclay 's brush !
can jack duel with my winchester ?
what about mine ? mine 's practically brand new . see ?
yah , what 's wrong with you ? it 's up to jack , no ?
it 's not a turkey shoot . it 's a gunfight . he needs a pistol .
peterborough . moncton .
stop that . yeah .
when the cowboys ride through ,
stop it .
wonan .
hey , i 'm not talkin ' to myself here . get up with me .
so what do you figure ? how far are we from a real country ?
you 're right , he 'll be comin ' for me .
the windmill right here on top of the well .
you volunteering to lay all that pipe , shear pin ?
the deal was , just help build the windmill .
stow your ideas .
but i suppose you know that .
oh , my , that 's gonna leave a mark .
perhaps i can interest you in .
you 're selling spirits ! cough medication , claude .
look ...
it 's a hammer
you 're all right ?
i feel safe up here .
yes . yeah , that part was true .
in the months before he left for good ..
do you like that ?
what jack said in the schoolhouse ..
are you looking to get killed ?
now , does that sound right to you ?
if i was able
i couldn 't have just walked away when i was called out in wyoming ,
twice in arizona .
and if i should 've been able
i thought he shot your pa .
broke his jaw and a bloody nose , but ..
how do you like that ?
he was anything but common .
when i shot that man ...
this is what i do .
hi , sean . your clothes look nice .
get it on your belt .
why ?
all right .
this was a mess .
when you pull back , don 't jam your thumb in the hammer .
oh ! oh , there we go .
oh , you have got to be kidding me .
bullet fragmented . i 'm really sorry , jack .
oh , thank god . i thought you ...
.. shootin ' that ear of yours almost clean off your head .
but , you know , what 's done is done . enough 's enough .
and i ... i really don 't want it to come to that .
your room number is 507 .
you really don 't speak any hebrew ?
stefan is really lousy at cover work .
security cameras and the layout
and the lobby ,
how long are we supposed to stay at the bar ?
just long enough for people there
even a little ?
and here we have ..
face forward .
and here , not so close to the face .
they did it when we were in morning rehearsal .
you don 't think she had to go underground , do you ?
i just want her to call .
fraulein bannion .
i 've just spoken with madame blanc .
morgen .
yeah , i know . it 's crazy .
yeah , no , i 'm-i 'm ... i 'm ready .
okay . yeah .
yes . not one of our girls .
i agree .
that we 're still part of the world .
she senses a lot .
i see it every night .
is it true ?
it 's all right .
is she all right ?
the markos company special .
hey , let me know if she needs a valium .
they are frequent bedfellows .
eat .
maybe the police , they missed something .
whole hidden areas of the building .
i saw images of that last night .
you can tell they have money .
but there is dissent amongst them .
madame blanc 's involved in this ?
you can give someone your delusion , sara .
that was the reich .
insignia .
these " mothers , " yeah , they could be
but i do know you are living with dangerous people .
she got that argentinian couple a baby .
you need something , man .
thought we 'd established that .

someone has to be lookout .
you holler if you change your mind .
the general is requiring
big fence lots of guard dogs .

i 'm with bellick on this one .
if the roles were reversed and you were the one locked up ,

i don 't know how you could just ..

we 'll have to stop it . bob ! the monorail !
of the worst crime area in the city . it 's perfect .
" it 's a superhero 's playground . " right .
my husband used to listen to a police scanner .
and i got mad at him for it .
" closing ! the point is :
and i 'm no exception .
are you sure the police are gonna be okay with this ?
they still haven 't forgiven us
with all due respect .
things would have been different .
.. on budget and ahead of schedule ..
boom ! no casualties !
one thing leads to another
that 's fantastic , honey !
i am so proud of you , really .
i know you want to get out there and you will soon .
i couldn 't have done this
it 's nothing .
l felt like an outcast before .
yay , me .
they 've all been in hiding .
and names they 've given themselves .
i 've always considered you
l am called brick .
wisconsin .
you 're tech-savvy . i need to lock onto a signal .
how fast can you slap something together
need to go out of town , pronto .
that you are too lazy to deal with .
to replace true experience with simulation .
you don 't play games , you watch game shows .
every meaningful experience must be packaged .
so that you can remain ever sheltered .
ever ravenous consumers ..
break a sweat and participate in life .
and make yourselves ever more powerless in the process .
that your interests are being served .
so that the system can keep stealing from you .
grab your snacks , watch your screens ,
i am .
sorry !
what happened is you destroyed my evidence .
what did you guys do to me ?
your tracker worked like a charm , evelyn .
okay .
then i 'll be good to go .
you need major life realignment
we 've made amazing headway in a very short time .
just now , at a worldwide summit ...
have agreed to make superheroes legal again !
yin and yang .
pleasing them , engaging them , figuring out what they want .
what do you think they want ?
people will trade quality for ease every time .
yeah . kind of like this case .
don 't ask me to do it again , darling .
l am joking , robert . i enjoyed the assignment .
we deserve each other .
we can 't go to e 's .
they were wearing them , too .
they 've probably done the same to mom .
no mom , no dad .
but we have our powers , this car .
that all races are equal and all this sort of thing
it gave birth to you
the state of south africa now tells you
and defendant number two , the accomplice , stephen lee
so .. that 's that .
shit ! don 't shoot ! don 't shoot !
lights out 11 : 00 , morning bell 5 : 00
now ... total silence !
best bloody kip in years .
fall out !
alright , guys , move along . move along
they wear blue shirts for a reason
kitson
please
yeah . it 's .. it 's an honour
ja , but we don 't plan on staying that long .
it reminds you there 's another world outside all this .
calm down , now
damned bastards !
good boy .
but your whole plan is doomed to failure .
you 're young . and i like you .
what you do affects everyone .
but if we can unlock three doors , we can unlock 20 ..
it doesn 't matter if it 's 100 .
we 're not going with you because there 's nowhere to go .
you 're not listening to us
why ?
we don 't agree .
follow your conscience .
anything short of escape is a pact with the devil himself .
one by one , this government is hacking
you 're all talk . no action .
i 've been thinking about it again , that night .
i can 't not think about it .
weren 't we just gonna try and keep it out ?
it was a long time ago .
yeah , i know .
there 's a news story .
uh , a featured article . well , whatever you call it .
mia ?
that 's his name , codger .
ah , you don 't like him .
it 's so hard to get presents for you .
exactly . no , ali 's gonna love him .
i 'll take him back .
no , no , no , no , you 're right . it 'll be good for ali .
now , they 're subjective .
i don 't remember anything . it 's a total blank .
what , getting drunk ?
the whole area smells like a pub .
aroma 's a great memory boost , helps anchor you
ok . now , hold that smell in your mind ,
yeah . i went to a sort of comic shop ..
i 'm looking at his id .
arrived this evening , 5 : 00 pm , from haneda .
connecting flight .
kai kahale , born 1954 . retired .
he shot her with a silencer , one shot .
get his picture out . send it out to the airports and the borders .
all right , get as much information as you can
sure .
uh . ?
so , she 's deceiving me
well , i feel both flattered and hurt .
oh my god , that 's who you look like .
it 's a little white lie , everyone does it .
and how single are you right now ?
well , i won 't tolerate deception in my relationship .
don 't do that , you 've got gold here .
what ? why would you tell him that ?
so you wouldn 't want to have anything on penny ?
so , if i actually know something right now ...
she took my where 's waldo .
oh , yeah , there he is .
why 's it taking so long ?
oh , no , what happened ?
wet wall ?
so why don 't they just get more drywall ?
bernadette told me your apartment 's ready .
but is sheldon really believing all this crap ?
i 'm not explaining myself vert well .
believe me , that 's a considerable stroke of good fortune ..
however , it was you who made the call so you 're running the risk .
they ... about a year ago ... you see .
unfortunately , i have no photographs ...
to be honest , i haven 't decided yet. but i would like to have a ..
valuation ? exactly ,
oh no , not at all . he doesn 't know me .
if you hold on , i 'll put you through .
but you see , before he died
sold !
can we open bidding please at one million euros ?
one milion five back in the room ! one million six hundred thousand
one million nine hundred thousand !
gesundheit ! was that a bid , sir ?
two million one hundred thousand
at two million seven hundred thousand !
at two million seven hundred thousand euros !
have we ever talked about money you and me ?
been good enough for me , you old misert .
my only regret is never being able to persuade you
you 're right , double wasn 't enough .
never has anyone had the gall to keep me waiting forty minutes in the rain !
please et me explain . i tried to call your office , but
but nobody answered and i don 't have your mobile number .
serves her right .
so much the worse for her it 's no concern of mine
all right , put her through .
virgil , please forgive me .
nothing too serious i hope .
what does all this mean ?
that 's all , nothing more than a useless exercise in deduction .
did you ever doubt me ?
oh , nothing . so maybe one day you 'll invite me to dinner .
yes , you can ! that is one thing i am good at !
william-adolphe bouguereau :
nobody , mr. oldman . it was already broken .
why ?
no , no ... mr ..
1t doesn 't matter who i am
miss thbetson
mr oldman can you hear me ? mr. oldman .
i cannot lay a hand on your possessions without a signed contract .
would you be so kind as to leave it on the table in the hallway ?
yes , but i do not accept yours miss lbbetson !
be careful !
but please believe me i didn 't mean anything by it .
my car was stolen . i had to go to the police to report it .
the one in the city centre .
that 's enough of this interrogation ! no more of this !
are you here , miss lbbetson ?
are you here ?
which i don 't find in the least amusing !
we could be onto something big here !
three pieces of the mosaic is just not enough , mr. oldman .
the house was in a terrible state even then .
about twenty-seven .
nothing really . i never had much to do with her .
twenty-four thousand .
thirty thousand !
forty thousand on the telephone ! forty five thousand in the room !
sixty thousand !
seventy thousand ! at seventy thousand !
seventy-five thousand ! eighty thousand on the telephone !
you were too slow , billy that 's all there is to it !
you were too late ! too late ! you didn 't keep up with me for christ 's sake !
maybe you 're right ; maybe i 'm not up to it like i used to be ..
it 's the way things go . you never went into a rage like this before .
it 's a pleasure . robert has told me so much about you .
why don 't you come and grab a bite with us ?
all right , we won 't insist but that 's a promise .
it was us who called the meeting .
all right mr. oldman .
what does she want now ?
meet her where ?
i 'm extremely grateful to you for accepting the invitation , mr. oldman .
fred has a limp , you don 't .
i know you can 't stand my excuses .
i won 't deny that your whimsical little ways are getting a bit tiresome .
typical of a silly , superficial woman as you put it .
nothing personal , believe me .
it 's not easy to explain to you because i know you won 't believe my anyway .
i don 't meet many people .
haven 't left the house since i was fifteen
i 've always done that even when my parents were here
why do you go around with your hands covered by gloves ?
you 're afraid of touching others .
i 'm afraid of going to places where other people live .
you 'd like me to believe that for twelve years you haven 't walked along a street ?
wanting to be a hermit and employing a caretaker in the house doesn 't add up .
that 's how ic 's done isn 't it ?
but. it expired quite some time ago .
that 's true enough , i suppose ...
wanted to mention that in certain critical cases
it means the whole thing will take a little longer
you dye your hair . i never noticed .
i trust even less people who have such a high opinion of themselves
i 'll just coming to bring miss lbbetson her shopping .
these are the keys to the house .
it 's what miss lbbetson wanted
otherwise she 'll get scared and panic .
that can 't be easy .
you know , gear boxes are like people .
so you believe time can make any kind of cohabitation possible .
zou 've reminded me of a friend of mine
what 's that fear of open spaces and distances ?
recently she gave him the keys to her house
he 's gonna be thinking what does she need ? shampoo , medicine ,
'm not so sure
can we put it that way ?
but i mean , there are still .. still too many pieces missing
we 're still groping around in the dark .
a closed door ? yes
hello ?
am i disturbing you ? is it late ?
i told you , from now on you can call me any time you like .
qh , what do you think ?
i 'm not sure if it 's a good idea to sell .
i couldn 't say i don 't know what your plans are .
out of necessity ? in order to start life afresh or some other reason ?
i 'd even sell the house . it 's too big for me now .
no , i 'd like to keep that .
okay .
you 'll have to decide whether we do the photography here or in a studio .
hello ?
i couldn 't sleep at night , virgil .
but how did you get it ?
how much do you want , billy ?
i just want to get back to where we were .
this is great ! this is great !
but the best bit is this
i 'd say ! i 'd say we 're at a turning point !
so how did things go with your friend ?
quite a few , to be honest .
there was something too contorted about it , to imprudent .
the mathematical set of a six-day week .
what will you have , sir ?
your tea 's ready , sir .
amazing ! well done .
i 've brought you the valuations of the furniture and paintings .
i don 't know a thing about this .
i notice you 've been spending time in the cellars recently
thank you for your trust .
no , but i was worried
this illness of yours is so absurd it almost seems unreal .
ve were abroad
i was just a little girl but it kept on happening more and more often
only one , during a school trip to prague .
i remember a restaurant with vert strange decor .
you don 't seem too pleased and yet we 're almost there .
no , i 'm delighted . you 're a force of nature .
incomplete
and to my failure to understand them .
when you think you 've made it with a woman
never stop surprising
you 're asking me to behave in a way that just isn 't me
what do you think ? do you like it ?
it looks marvellous on you , claire .
as you wish , mr. oldman .
yes .. nearly thirty years .
like taking part in an auction sale .
this one . i love that .
beautiful , you 've done vert well .
claire .
and you 'll take me to one of your auctions
claire , don 't be like this let 's talk .
no , don 't blame yourself
oh , you 're kidding ...
this one has a wider range .
just make sure you remember to re-programme the pc .
thanks , darling.all right , no worries .
any idea you like
oh yes .... . to the noma in copenhagen !
yes , and after dinner you 'll come and have coffee with us .
joking apart , i 'd be glad if you did see her
your champagne .
let 's see if you can calculate this !
i can turn my hand to interior decorating .
i can 't tell you how long i 've been wanting to spend time alone with you
to your irony , virgil .
what ?
dinner is served . please be seated
i offer no guarantees .
why ?
at the finest restaurant in town .
you see , claire , there 's nothing vert original about my life .
that 's beautiful
that in simulating another person 's work
i really love the way you talk .
you haven 't said anything about claire .
and she 's much more beautiful than you described .
so now you 're going to make me jealous ?
you pray that girl never gets better .
no , together , always together . that 's important .
it 's about robert .
don 't be afraid to tell me
i guess i 'm just .. i 'm afraid of losing him .
do you want me to talk to him ?
claire ?
that goes for you , too .
promise me you won 't say a word to him .
have you been waiting there long ?
why , is there something wrong ?
tell him how much you 're owed for your work . he 'll pay you on the spot .
you 're not the trustworthy discreet man i thought you were .
it 's as if they weren 't mine .
i don 't know , i don 't know
always ..
has this ever happened before ?
i 'm telling you
with somebody under different names .
let 's hope so .
one hundred and forty thousand euros !
one hundred and sixty thousand lady at the back !
one hundred and eighty thousand on the telephone !
two hundred and twenty thousand !
still nothing mr. oldman . i 'll keep looking here .
i 'll call you later .
two hundred and eighty thousand .
sold !
just keep looking
let 's wait a bit longer .
that she 'll come back ... or turn up
well , that depends .
so why did she run away ?
y 'know , that drove her to take that kind of decision .
you 're the only person in the whole world
they all said that
i don 't even know how i can help you .
considering the lady 's illness
that 's not likely . i don 't think she had any enemies .
but who ?
the young knight rescuing the damsel from the clutches of the old man
don 't go overboard , virgil .
recently she 's been experiencing emotions and feelings
iuman emotions are like works of art
rorgert ?
no problem
what do you think you 're gonna do now ?
yeah , i wouldn 't push too hard if i were you .
you 'll see , when you least expect it things will just fall into place quite naturally .
virgil ? virgil , is that you ?
help ! help !
it is up !
ve never felt it to be a real home more like a hotel
seems to have been planned to welcome a lot of people .
and since you 've become my family ..
tnext week i have an auction in jondon .
and the vert last !
virgil ? yes .
how do you feel now you 're onstage for the last time ?
my colleagues have come to see me off .
they won 't have to put up with me anymore .
i got dizzy in the car yesterday .
we 're ready , mr. oldman . i 'm coming .
constantly .
good , give them my love .
this isn 't her area of expertise .
i trust her .
i 've got a consult waiting .
we put together some stats
why is my baby gonna be pooh-covered ?
that 's right .
you 're a fast learner .
come on . you blame him ? she 's hot .
he 's being gross , not to mention unprofessional .
damn it .
slutty .
okay , i know i 'm not perfect .
so here i am , ready to listen .
like a priest at confession .
it was always one of my best qualities .
sir , you want to take a look at this .
he 's fine ? he 'll be okay ?
you should be prepared for that .
you think i 'm silly , i know ...
so does he .
we get domestic partnerships .
mail it in if you 're even more romantic .
i-i just wanted the big day that everybody else gets .
i organized rallies , i ...
why don 't you just go ahead ?
input 1 is the cable box
ay ! that sounds like so much fun .
oh , we should definitely do that sometime .
do you see how she gives me the cold shoulders ?
ay . sorry .
she 's a pritchett .
the sooner the better .
yeah . why don 't you go ? now .
feel better !
some ice on my back !
i just needed a few minutes alone to find it .
and even better , two days later
i forgot my phone .
well , sweetie , i 'd love to hear about it
but where does that leave me ?
okay .
i 'm sick of hearing you whine about miranda !
but we can 't !
no one will know .
i 'm just saying i liked her the way she was .
i 'm sorry , doctor .
uh , dad , she 's still a sweet little doll .
no , she 's just changed a little .
it 's so wonderful to finally meet you .
well , thank you very much .
i can 't remember when we 've had a
truth be told , i 'm a little nervous .
well , these artifacts have never been
if anything should happen ...
he 's in financial control of the tournament , and
does she know about our cameras ?
wow ... look at you .
i 've been retired way too long .
you never told me why you retired so early .
chizuru is the last descendant of that clan .
you unlock the passageway to the other dimension
you have a necklace and a mirror ...
oh , miss logical , i forgot .
i mean , how does that even happen ?
chizuru 's father was a genius , and he was able to
enter another dimension .
i know , it 's crazy .
legend has it promising unlimited power to
that 's a lesson for another day , when you 're ready
let 's get a closer look , okay ?
who is that ?
no way out . he 's trapped .
wait ! back off ! back off !
let me in there before it 's too late .
.. stop !
get on the ground !
he didn 't take the sword .
what ?
people will die if you don 't find the real one .
yes .
come on , dad , it 's time to lay down .
water knows how to benefit all things
therefore , it comes near the tao .
in cultivating your mind ,
we make doors and windows for a room ,
mai .
you scared me .
i 've been worried about you .
why didn 't you tell me where you were going ?
dad ?
i 've shut down the tournament as you instructed .
yes .
except ... there 's been an override .
he 's challenging everyone .
so we 're alone now .
but remember the message we got ?
both of us ?
well , this could be our chance , two against one
wait , what 's happened ?
vice and mature .
the balls to accept my challenge .
who am i ? oh , ho-ho ..
watch out , here i come , ladies .
in this arena , i make all the rules .
i can change the rules , i can change the setting .
how about a little taste , ladies ?
ramon ? it 's vice .
i know , but it 's fine .
he 's going to be calling you next .
type in the password .
yeah , i know . it sucks .
wait a second , how 'd you do that ?
that 's classified .
actually , we stopped him from stealing
look , this guy 's a murderer , he 's on the loose .
it 's complicated .
see , that 's right . i know all about it .
so he can be king of fighters .
look , i 'm trained to believe in the tangible ,
people are dying
no . but you 'll believe mai .
the undercover operative you assigned to infiltrate
she 's in seattle .
she 'll confirm everything i 'm telling you .
chizuru sent me here for a reason .
tell me more .
eventually , it consumes you , and you can 't shake it .
where did he go ?
kyo , he didn 't do anything .
why ?
good .
i 'm looking for a sword .
well , it 's yours , but it seems you don 't
it 's just a bunch of legends
that you and he were destined to be enemies .
he 's not .
the way the story goes , as far as i know it ,
instead , it consumed him with a murderous rage .
so they say .
you really believe that stuff ?
it 's not simple . he 's in another dimension .
dimension . there 's only one dimension .
nobody travels to another dimension
thank you .
oh , of course you have .
y-you actually believe you 've gone to
terry .... .
wait a minute , what ? what did you say ?
wow , this just keeps getting better and better .
actually , i can 't think of anyone else
i don 't think so . you ..
i got issues . wow .
enough .
who said anything about me fighting ?
come on . where 's the old lori i know and love ?
bravo !
accept it .
do it !
no one will stop us !
what do you see in there ?
can 't you be yourself here ?
you know , one lost soul can recognize another
what do you want from me ?
why ?
i don 't know that your father would agree with that .
what makes you think that i can succeed
kyo , i don 't know what you are .
that 's something you 'll have to discover ,
look , i don 't know what 's going on with these things
come on , we 're cia , it 's called " confiscate . "
while you 're out there getting romantic with
no , you haven 't .
what is she doing here ?
we 've no time to lose .
ah , that 's because there 's no other dimension , right ?
dimensions , see ? i told you there was more than one .
or parallel universe .
this means he can use a portal to force
we have an appointment .
this is all happening in real-time . this is amazing .
lori , not now .
did you really expect me just to hand it over ?
kyo , i 'm sorry for what happened to your
just , believe in yourself .
which is not going to happen this time .
then use your strength to do the right thing .
i 'm going in there .
well , it 's about time i start .
terry !
i 'm your partner .
welcome to my humble ... abode .
good to see you .
all this because you want to be king of fighters ?
then why don 't you stop all of this and
here , i 'm immortal .
this is where we come to challenge ourselves
i 'll be king of everything .
you 're not invincible ..
oh , god ...
hurry , find the other treasure pieces .
this was your father 's favorite level .
he tried to kill you , didn 't he ?
it controlled him . it made him do that .
my father loved me !
let 's mix it up a bit .
let 's mix it up a bit .
ooh , that 's a bit barbaric , isn 't it ?
batter up .
terry .... .
nut-cracking is part of the group 's cultural heritage
it will be years before he could even lift a rock like this .
it will be many years before isha ' s son can fend for himself .
for freddy 's gang , the rain is less welcome .
i didn 't sleep .
well , why don 't you move back upstairs and sleep in our bed ?
i think that would confuse things .
i 'll try but i can 't guarantee anything .
says the prince as he rides off into the sunset .
you know what your problem is ?
you should go to a spa or go shopping .
hello ?
a dinner party ?
well , given that we 're hosting it , i 'd say so .
why is that ?
so did mike say anything ?
i 'm sure it 's not that bad .
i left three messages .
i did everything but foam at the mouth .
it 's like every time i get within 10 feet of karl , i just become this monster .
she 's shy . she doesn 't say much .
nice meeting you .
private sessions ?
private sessions allow us to work on the personal issues of both partners .
and how can i work on that if he 's not in the room ?
or pants . pants wouldn 't hurt .
hey , where have you two been ?
oh , is that the kind of thing you meant ?
the kids are bouncing off the walls ? huh .
rex rex .
we were the golden couple .
why is this happening ?
all right , see ya . have fun .
where are you going ?
very interesting .
oh , look who 's still alive .
got it . you know what to do .
ninety seconds .
i 'm here to tell you that 's never gonna happen .
did you ever stop and ask yourself
strange accusation coming from a terrorist .
if you don 't hear from us ..
don 't take your eyes off him .
where 's hunt ?
calm down .
i have no way of contacting them .
what i do have is an extraction team with

it was probably faith 's idea to set the fire .
this is an ongoing investigation , sean .
i can 't let you into this house
this has nothing to do with emily .
no . uh , i think that 's when i snuck out to the car to listen to the game .
well would 've invited carlos , except ..
yeah .

right , right . it 's just ...
there 's no need to act like a silent movie heroine .
i broke the seal .
i can 't help it . my hormones are in overdrive .
no . never .
not even when you heard an acoustic guitar ?
oh , i just can 't control myself like that .
whenever i feel my emotions getting the best of me .
then if i have time , i go back and open the box
thanks .

all right . come on , girl .

come here .
okay .
what are you fighting about ?
can we talk to you about something ?
the other day at the pizza place ..
oh , sweetie , i am so sorry .
that 's the vibe that bruce lee taught me .
that 's what i get from bruce .
1959 , when i was 18 .
he beat this kid up , but he didnt know
if he wanted his immigration status to be us citizen ,
in seattle , my father started teaching martial arts .
if you had a sincere interest in martial arts ,
bruce used to come to my high school
it wasn 't long after that
we would get together on campus
and it was like ,
i mean , it was very difficult .
the ban on interracial marriage was lifted in 1968 .
i don 't care how good you are , 1351b wrestler
but the fact is , it wasn 't about mass .
but , then again ,
you got the job on the green hornet ,
and it 's a heck of a name , man .
mr reid 's residence .
we could care less about teen hornet .
everybody in the neighbourhood was fighting to be bruce lee ,
you do the old john wayne ,
there 's a shot of bruce and he 's doing a kick ,
there were all these seasoned actors doing their thing ,
when i did the green hornet , i was not being myself
by the way , i did a really terrible job in that , i have to say .
he was always trying to be a holistic person ,
and he was a very literate guy .
all type of knowledge ultimately means self-knowledge .
any book i 'd pick up , there were notations about
what was functional , what was no good !
most of the writings in the
he might have changed " fighter " from " fencer , " but
it sounds chinese but it 's very much an american martial art .
the philosophy bruce lee had was :
it can be taught .
but it cannot really be standardised .
but it was very personal to him .
jkd in 1970 will be different . "
you talk about chinese boxing .
well , first we use the feet .
and then we use the elbow .
do you use the thumb too ?
because that is the expression of the human body .
the crazy thing about martial
bruce lee is definitely the father of mixed martial arts .
if dana white says bruce lee is the father of mixed martial arts ,
as i was choking him ,
gene lebell taught bruce lee grappling moves .
then had a spin , do a crescent kick on me
if you 're gonna say father of mixed martial ...
he 's the first one who decided to put it all together
they say that bruce lee was the father of mixed martial arts .
if he 's the father of mixed martial arts
when you get into this whole martial arts thing
but bruce lee is 100 percent the father of mixed martial arts .
it 's really heavy and it says ,
i think the successful ingredient in it
myself , right .
he was very proud of longstreet , and it was very much from him
he 's one of my students .
yes .
but there were some lines there expressed your philosophy .
i remember .
i said empty your mind .
like water .
put water into a bottle , it becomes the bottle .
now , water can flow or creep or drip or crash .
like that . you see ?
that was .. it was made
he 's from the land . he 's one of the folk .
and this is why it was so
it 's about making violence look beautiful
but the western movies really piss me off .
in three months he was swinging
every gangster in town had nunchakus ,
in a short time i think almost every child is using this .
it 's outlawed now in california .
but i always hit my elbow .
and i hit my head
i tried to make my parents
i had the rubber ones . so i 'm good .
i carried a gun for years .
i think i went into therapy and i thought ,
they 're ready to film , have all this crew ,
bruce knew what he wanted dragon to be ,
it was kind of hard around
if he didn 't like anything you did , he would tell you .
she knew how to talk to him and counsel him .
it was a coming together , and ,
don 't think . reel .
action .
bruce lee is explosive in a way that no one had seen before .
you see a lot of complex emotions all going on at once .
the mirror scene was just , you know , when he 's walking around
you defeat the enemy
this was bruce lee 's film in hollywood .
i was called and came to the hospital .
it was a cerebral oedema ,
the doctors were very reassuring .
he didn 't have frequent headaches .
i had seen him in june .
he was not worried about
he 's on the verge of stardom in the united states
it 's the kind of problem
so eventually the ambulance arrived . it took a long time .
he got to the hospital and i saw him laying there
oh , thank god , you 're here .
i got the mars rover stuck in a ditch .
on a dusty highway just outside bakersfield .
howard , is everything okay ?
you brought a girl to the mars rover control room ?
one free barium enema ,
so the eye patch and e insults worked ?
it was a fiasco .
i need you and rai to help me get the rover out of the ditch
yes , i was bad . maybe she 'll spank me .
hey , howard , you know , it 's getting late ,
kind of a mars rover ... mars rover
so my friend leonard is gonna take you home .
i 'll call ya .
no one 's a scientist like howard .
how nice . maybe they can carpool
what , what , what were you saying ?
he 's got a great sense of humor .
a lot .
yeah , i am loyal .
out of curiosity ,
the guy was wearing an eye patch .
you 're not gonna see me now .
anything ?
but , uh , no , the rover is not responding .
hang on .
you could try calling triple-a .
plus i understand you have to be standing
snap what ?
what 's plan b ?
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
leonard is subtly signaling
you started by asking if i was from mars
is there some problem ?
listen , i have to kinda sneak out for a while .
no , wait !
i can 't tell you that .
i can 't tell you that , either .
yeah , i really didn 't think this through .
what ?
i don 't know . just tell ' em i went to the office .
then how can i say it convincingly ?
what is ... ? no , not like that !
i 'm going to the office .
i 'm going out for a while .
doesn 't anyone want to know where he 's going ?
leonard is going to the office .
busy .
i 'm hoping that 's three different guys .
he didn 't make it .
oh , you know , i 'm a physicist , so ..
well , i wrote some of it down .
who was that you choked out , man ?
d0ots .
you got to tell them the real story , man .
that 's a made-up name .
it really makes me miss the ' 90s ,
check it out .
shit
ve shared so much in that car !
what are you doing ?
don 't leave me here alone !
i can 't co that !
let 's go . come on , buddy . you got it .
shoot him !
oh . this was actually an octopus-related incident .
apparently , they have many , many arms .
yes , and ..
anyone with half a brain , myself included ,
so now this department has invested
like that 's going to work .
she doesn 't get that it 's always worse
you begin a slow , painful unraveling
we don 't want to do the same thing
what if we actually went into the secret service
who 's this ?
she was a student at mc state .
and now she 's dead .
and thac 's the dealer
i mean , we care so much more because she 's black
uh .. no , we 're not . if it was a white person , i wouldn 't even care .
why every time you speak i want to throw the fuck up ?
we have to agree . you know what i mean ?
oh , hey , there 's two of you . you 're twins .
we 're the yangs , man . kenny vang . what 's up ?
what 's going on ?
yeah , dad 's chinese , man .
mr. mcquaid ?
what has been the result of the war on drugs ?
because this is a college seminar ,
i can personally tell you that .
then your dealer 's probably selling you some pretty stepped-on shit .
this is where you get to decide who you actually are ,
why are you saying this stuff ?
i want you to question what i 'm saying .
you can be whatever you want .
george washington was a black lesbian .
you know what ? let 's just play the game , okay ?
hey , that girl 's in my psych class .
you come talk to her with me .
all right , all right .
dude , i am so sorry .

like , a meat q-tip .
blue 20 !
you love walk-on day now ?
no , i 'm good .
if you see that safety line up that deep , though , hit me quicker .
it 's funny , ' cause he 's my brother . so .
hey , uh , you know , we have this rush party at zeta .
it 'd be really fun , i think .

zook has the tattoo ?

i really want you guys to hang out .
we 're gonna put cameras everywhere ,
all right , your plan is stupid . i 'm sorry .

i was talking to him for a second .
i feel like he could fuck this whole thing up for us .

shh . i 'm trying to hear them be nice about me .
and connects with mcquaid !
holy shit , he 's good .
if you do , he 'll leave this shitty program .

and the crowd rushes the field
good luck , guys .
zook and mcquaid !
this fucking .. waiter !

oh , fuck you .
we 're the goddamned military !
did you really think they were gonna pay you ?
cartel .
let 's go , it 's not worth it .
we gotta stop ' em .
i wish you hadn 't seen this .
anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law .
i 'm the president of the united fucking states , man .
i could just as easily send you back to your pals
you know what this is ?
find her , find mendez .
in acapulco .
uh , uh , uh .
see , even here , people talk about machete .
you 'll miss the peepshow .
get him !
machete .
you want to use me to get to him ?
now .
i said no freebies .
any one of us could have killed you .
mendez is gonna gut you like a game hen .
you 're here to kill him , aren 't you ?
mendez is many things , but merciful is not one of them .
mendez isn 't who you think he is .
all he truly wants is a better mexico .
please , machete .
do nothing , say nothing , or you 're dead .
new bodyguard . mother 's orders .
i 'm not gonna kill you .
leave him to me !
shoot me !
even if we get out of here alive ,
we won 't survive a mile , let alone the border .
you have 24 hours , my friend .
hell , anyone with a loaded weapon
yeah ?
i have mendez in custody .
wait a second .
we 're a little lost . any chance you could steer us to leon ?
the trouble is , you 've seen my face and i 've just changed .
it 's just a matter of time and place not meeting in your favour .
is there a bus that goes nearby ?
i didn 't know what that meant ,
i chewed his balls off with my teeth !
i despise men . i can 't trust them .
and now my little cereza lays dead because of that reason .
as random as a selection as you might be ,
yes ?
mendez and machete .
and gather all the girls .
hey .. you want mendez ? here i am !
yup , yup , yup , this is the perfect place for my last meal .
forgive my excitement , but i 'm just learning to speak spanish .
but fuck it . when in rome , right ?
perhaps you 've heard of it ?
you haven 't heard of it , or " no se ' , " you don 't understand the question ?
i 'm really trying here .
now then , villa guerrero ?
suck on this !
so i 'm still alive .
this is the crazy you talking ?
you used to be cartel .
why ?
i was a secret agent for the mexican government .
i had to see things .
i had to watch people die in ways that no man ever imagined .
you 'd never make it past the wall in this piece of shit .
small town near the border .
satellite feed coming online .
come on . come on , come on , come on .
this is cartel turf . you led us right to ' em , you crazy son of a bitch !
they 're all around us ,
well , this ain 't enterprise fucking rent-a-car .
i would do as he says , grasa .
marcos mendez in the flesh .
crazy like a gypsy fuck , man !
drive through it ? it 's solid concrete .
even jesus couldn 't get through that damn wall !
i was never straight a 's in algebra ,
no distractions this time , right , clebourne ?
all right then .
special agent mendez .
sorry , that 's classified .
my welcome party .
who do you think gave me that missile in the first place ?
why re-elect president rathcock ?
he built a wall protecting us from the threat of illegals .
and to boost our national economy to an all-time high ,
but there is still so much left to accomplish .
tanks , missiles , bread and butter .
why mendez ?
well , bin laden is dead
i have high hopes for you , mr. machete .
a spaceship ?
not to mention , my legacy .
before what i like to call " the incident "
and that 's why i built this .
and when kingdom comes , as it surely will ,
you really believe that ?
and luckily for you , sir , i saw you up there with me .
it 's a condition i was left with after " the incident "
demonstration .
encore . encore .
genetically-engineered super soldiers , you see .
have at ' em .
no match for the likes of you .
and that poor dead bastard you met in mexico , zaror ,
you still haven 't told me why i 'm here .
there is only one machete .
what if there was an army of enhanced machetes ?
you and i together would be a force to be reckoned with .
join me .
then you know i 'm taking this .
you know i 'm the only one that can disarm it .
too many syllables ?
why ?
and like it or not , mr. machete , you 're coming with me .
try not to get too many : of yourselves killed in the process !
it keeps turning shit inside-out .
seems like he 's building some sort of secret weapon ,
he wants to get there before the missiles take off .
launch trigger is wired to a biological clock .
yeah . but you don 't like him .
come on , machete , he 's with us .
he 's our only bomb guy .
i hear it 's always the blue wire .
he came to me about six months ago .
cabrones ain 't got no tune .
that 's why i 'm here .
copy that .
thank you .
my fellow travellers , my friends ,
in a moment , the boarding process will begin .
reveal your new selves to me !
tell them you orchestrated all this . the missiles , the heart .
all right , folks , let 's keep it moving
missile launch in i minus two minutes
keep your hands in the straps and hold on tight .
you 're gonna make me kill a blind chick ?
that 's all right . they 'll just give it to the next bimbo who spreads like butter .
they 're not just studying the kids ,
so , this was not , you know ..
they knew exactly who they had chosen
david 's father stood out .
he was so proud of him . whatever he did was wonderful .
the most traditional was eddy 's father ..
.... who was rather strict . he was the boss .
eddy 's relationship with his father ..
and that matters .
because otherwise , i would have known him ,
he was very gregarious .
he wrecked a car
eddy and his dad were very different as people .
elliott had a very strong militaristic
so does it look something like ...
no . and bigger .
this ?
max , something 's wrong in the kitchen .
just come with me .
sure , but at least be late .
i heard what he said .
sophie , just relax ,
well , i don 't need a gown .
it 's owen .
italian , sushi , whatever you 're in the mood for . "
you can make him a romantic dinner ,
how do people get to know each other ?
we didn 't have any money growing up .
my father was ..
we moved a lot because
i guess you 'll be leaving .
that 's for being cute and for sharing that .
is it weird that i want to talk now ?
never would 've drawn that .
fine .
i think you mean " privates . "
i 'm not googling .
who has two penises ?
what 's going on back here ?
okay ! okay ! that 's it .
well , max , i guess he 's not the one ...
actually , i really like him ,
i 'm messed up on the inside .
i like talking now .
i crawled to detroit .
even the sight of one of them can be disturbing .
he was so happy after he passed it ,
how long have you been collecting ?
what 'd you get ? what 'd you get ?
in urology terms ,
i don 't know that i 'd call myself an infection .
can we please change the subject ?
dr. lorvis , what are you doing here ?
well , why not ?
and we had two wonderful mississippis .
oh , right .
dr. lorvis ?
happy ?
stick your hand in there and find out .
you will not fool me again .
he 's been gone a while .
it 's sad how some guys can 't cut the apron strings .
of course i do .
any chance you and bernadette could take care of my dog ?
why don 't you put your mother in a home ?
i 'll talk to bernie . i 'm sure it 's fine .
it 's happening ! it 's happening !
you 're kidding !
and you just got yourself uninvited .
how 'd you get him to come to your house ?
yeah , that , too . big check .
is it a trick clock or a trick potato ?
i wrote a fan letter to you when i was a child in texas ,
i 'll-i 'll give you a hint :
no , i-i get that .
and every day at 4 : 00 ,
la chinoise , sorry .
of course , she was delighted , she smiled , we kissed .
i know . thank you .
we 're here to talk about art , not showbiz gossip .
a bit pedantic but charismatic .
as a consultant ?
it was mainly with jean-luc , i ...
the problem is how to self-manage
no thanks , my love .
yes , i was saying the question is , how do we apply the same line ,
which implies an author with a capital
excuse me ... who is that guy over there ?
as you will hear , the subject turned to politics :
it is time to show the film industry 's solidarity
i demand the festival stops !
in this toxic context ,
luckily it was no worse .
that 's what godard has become . a teen idol .
i can 't stand the jerk .
leave it like that .
we must reclaim cinema .
a simple tool that everyone can and should use .
for the first time in ages
they love us over there . it could be great .
i have nothing to do with what you just said .
you have a revisionist idea of cinema .
what ? how can you say that ?
pierrot le fou ! contempt ! breathless !
your guests have arrived , mr. cobblepot .
welcome to the iceberg lounge .
pardon me , mr. cobblepot .
wah , wah .
you cost me money , funny girl !
just for a laugh !
nobody steals from me and walks away !
you 're right , you should kill her
except , you know what else is bad for business , sir ?
and i would hate for folks to say ? " mr. cobblepot takes your money
oy , lawton !
we got off on the wrong foot at the start of this mission .
can 't , it 's a school night .
the joker has a dirty bomb ?

i got someone new now , someone better !
this will have to do .
about time !
no problem .
the zombie is mine to liberate .
i 'm ot in the mood tonight , zsasz
she was acting odd .
do it ! i 'm begging you .
that 's what i thought .
start following orders , all of you !
she might even deserve me .
oh , harley , i take back half the horrible things i 've done to you .
yeah , we can see that harley , but where ?
it 's a shiatsu massage for your brain .
more cops .
this will work
i don 't trust this fruit loop .
you know what you 're doing , right ?
don 't stop working . yeah , waller .
oh . oh , that 's rich !
haven 't you solved it yet ?
t know that sound
i need to find joker and stop that bomb .
got to get out of here .
well , isn 't that convenient .
and now i 'm leaving too .
you gotta do what 's best for you with the time that you got .
you know i 'm crushing at work ,
no , actually that 's two steps up , above where i 'm at .
oh , i finally have service .
this is what inspired howard clifford to build ryme city .
unlike other regions , where pokemon live in the wild .
no battles , no trainers .
a stronger , more harmonious world .
fighting fires wouldn 't be the same without the squirtle partners .
lieutenant yoshida .
he was a legend in this precinct .
it was a terrible tragedy losing him and his partner .
his pokemon .
i 'm sorry , is yours mad at me ?
real big .
something is rotten ,
where is your pokemon partner ?
a loner . probably hiding something .
i may only be an unpaid intern ,
ok , you do that .
yeah yeah , no , that sounds great , that sounds great .
wait , i 'm confused , are you hearing other voices besides mine ?
can 't help you there , kid .
okay , so you are talking pikachu with
these are just choices .
black as night , thank you sweetie .
but i can 't solve my own mystery if i have no memory .
that 's how i found this , this ..
smell my finger .
coward .
oh , he on a bike !
look ! quick , get in front of him !
stop !
he going down hard , tim .
i hope he makes it .
i 'm good cop , you 're bad cop .
grow some pairs
we got ways to make you talk , or mime !
so tell us what we wanna know .
and what did it have to do with the r ?
now stop distracting me .
gengar wins !
and i want a rematch .
tell him he 's on , amigo .
our new battles are holding .
in my head i saw that differently .
i told you magikarp weren 't useless .
i thought you couldn 't wait to get out town .
i 'm not following .
if his pokemon partner still alive
tell him about the chemical r
and they were testing it , at the battles .
the neural link is operational .
we are losing power in the containment chamber !
now we are getting somewhere .
i hated rubbing your feet !
get a splitting headache now , you neurotic duck !
do it !
enjoy your meal .
i don 't speak to you for five years ,
i saw you in my bed this morning .
you role-play with me and i learn something about myself ?
seriously , you okay ?
this is not what i wanted .
but what is the point ? it doesn 't change anything .
do not make this another moment you will regret .
well , i 'd ask you about your fantasy again ,
ever since i was a kid , i wanted to enlist .
figured i 'd do some good , see some action .
no . there was an incident . got stuck behind a desk .
never enlisted ? what 's up with the dog tags ?
well , if you 're worried your fantasy sounds stupid ,
you got bullied ?
so when the most popular girl in school decided
that 's terrible .
sometimes he talked so much , i wanted to staple his mouth shut .
it was , like , an exercise .
yeah , i was branded " psycho stalker freak " for life .
i mean , obviously , the fantasy won 't be real ,
i 'd like to think that this is ... more exciting than riding a roller coaster .
i need to give ms. cole instructions .
you know , you can just say sorry .
he was talking to you .
you , sounds like you were a real ms. teen asshole 2009 back then .
and you . grow up .
revenge ain 't gonna fix you . only you can fix you .
never did right by her . i 'm gonna get you both off this island ,
go , go !
get out of here !
am i gonna be okay ?
you gotta save me , dude . i 'd do it for you .
i tried .
mom and dad love me more .
well , yes .
i had found what i 'd been looking for for decades ,
you didn 't want to leave surgery ?
hey . still no shane .
if he 's dead on the side of the road , i am going to lose it .
at a wedding ?
you have blisters on your feet from all the dancing ?
what ? !
i 'm gonna find you a ride home ,
jackson , pull over .
one day , the third one disappeared .
look , it all started because he came in here
at this point , i think you 're the only reason
i was with jimmy for five years .
you are 100 % his son .
spent everything i had .
and do they do anything to change it ?
listen to me !
but we can 't get married
if you don 't want to get married , just say so .
but that 's not the point . this isn 't about love .
i 'm not grieving !
can you make it quick ?
jimmy 's b.p. ' s gone to crap .
yeah .
he 's out of time .
what ?
you of all people should understand .
he has a dnr . i don 't think so .
okay .
hold on . dr. ross , take over .
it 's a branch of the superior mesenteric artery .
i 'm gonna throw a surgical tie around the clamp .
and what does the superior mesenteric artery supply ?
d owwin
how long it 's been down .
it 's ok . it 's just an air pocket .
that 's not the runway . where are we ?
me ? frank .
united states air marshall kirkland
yeah , someone 's hurt upfront .
unconscious . that 's all any body needs to know right now .
seater
yeah to prevent terrorist takeovers they installed an encoded auto-pilot system .
no mr. spair knew them too .
i study volcanoes and uh .... . i doubt this is the worst .
keep your distance and don 't fly us too close or you 'll cook us .
hope so .
i might be able to force it to maneuver .
that will destroy our engines .
breakfast in the mess hall happened .
it 's biscuits and gravy . you can 't have one without the other .
look alive tully . they 're calling all hands .
a thick cloud moving fast !

the ash cloud is causing interference .
i am urging you to reconsider the rescue .
those people will die up there if you don 't do something
and my men are not dying today .
rick , listen to me ! you can 't do this ! you 're gonna get us killed !
i have a lot of things that i want to do with my life .

and you are so beautiful .

you 're going to make it to you families .
the only thing i love in this world is a picture of my wife and kids .

i 'm here for the 10.00am yoga meditation class .
yeah , i noticed that , but every time i come here it 's full .
look , all i can tell you is plan ahead next time .
telling me to plan ahead is like telling me to sprout wings .
except i show up here and i can 't get in , and you tell me to plan ahead .
if i broke the rules for you , i 'd have to break ' em for the other moms .
i 'd have to get pissy right back and i don 't have time to read my magazine .
i hope some day you have lots of children .
please . human beings feed on misery .
hello . i want to thank you all for coming out here
yes , i know , it 's hard to hear .
they found scratching and bruising on her body , several broken bones
by the next morning , everyone on wisteria lane
they 're evacuees .
they have no other relatives , so we 're taking them to a house in the country .
if i 'm being interrogated , you could at least tell me your name .
well , i 'm very pleased to meet you , miss parkins .
we 're heading to crythin gifford
i 'm a pilot .
sorry . i didn 't mean to
thank you .
come on , up you get .
i do apologize for keeping you .
terrible mix up . thank you .
medicine , retired .
classroom 's in the library on the left .
these two are your bedrooms .
that one ?
do you think it was a nursery ?
tt feels .
come on .
who , miss parkins ?
'd best be off
if i should die before i wake , i pray the lord my soul to take .
how on earth are you gonna stay sane out here ?
helps keep my mind off things .
something about this place feels
all right , then . tell me what i 'm thinking
it 's just my way , how i cope .
with everything
yes , of course .
your stories can be about whatever you 'd like .
yes , joyce ?
no , no , not about that .
can you tell me what happened when the boys locked you in that room ?
you won 't be in trouble
who ? who told you not to tell ?
you tell me . this is important !
i reckon he saw a ghost .
you did , didn 't you , edward ?
i reckon so .
i 'm telling miss hogg about all of you .
were you in the cellar ?
not very pleasant , is it ?
thank you .
i don 't think he 's like that .
something about the eyes .
oh , we 've been in the services our whole lives .
that changed the day they volunteered .
i know what they look like .
will you excuse me ?
it 's just we all have our ways of coping . this is mine .
my husband teases me .
that he cuts his men more slack than i do my pupils .
our fears , doubts .
that 's what 'll destroy us .
are you sure there 's nobody else living here ?
i ... i think i saw someone .
i tried , i called out , but she disappeared .
not visions . you 're not listening to me .
this is not the first body i 've pulled from barbed wire , miss parkins .
she may have bore him , but i raised him .
we were coming home across the causeway .
she saw it happen from the nursery .
whenever she 's seen , and whoever by ,
come back , please . we 'll leave , then . we 'll leave , then !
your fault . your fault . you brought her back .
so the nazis bomb here instead of a real one .
and i start fire baskets , make it look like they 've hit us .
you said you were a pilot .
" lack of moral fiber , " they said .
and someday it will be recognized as a true disability ,
so movies , yes or no ?
great . i 'll see you later .
that doesn 't help .
go away , bird . go away , bird . go away , bird .
good idea . attention is what birds want .
now i 'll just get along with my life .
it depends on the activity .
if you 're playing vegas , i 'd add sequins .
i don 't want her to think that i think it 's a date .
no , but she might think i think it 's a date
if that 's so , what if i start talking to a girl ?
i 'm serious . i 'll do it .
what are you waiting for ?
sheldon , what do you expect us to do ?
biology is the study of living things .
i specialize in microorganisms ,
you 're right , it 's getting late .
all that time spent in fear .
he 's magnificent .
i just realized i haven 't offered you a beverage .
and after she lost her marbles with her remote control .
take a picture of us together .
if you were a dove , i 'd call you lovey-dovey .
let 's see if he can figure it out .
please don 't be mad .
nothing bad , just that last night was fine .
yeah , it 's a perfectly good word .
okay , well , let me ask you this :
okay ?
you know , i think this is one of those things where
so much . okay
actually , ethyl alcohol inhibits electrical conduction
oh , give me a freakin " break .
determined that there was
how do you know what the exact temperature of the room is ?
that is a snowy tree cricket .
i was done with latin by fifth grade .
i am willing to bet anything
of course i 'm joking
rai , what do you think ?
god , i had the most horrible night .
forgive me .
and if it was , it wasn 't spoken for long .
the point is , you 're wrong again .
we haven 't established that i 'm wrong once . all right .
he 's a snowy tree cricket ,
holy crap .
don 't do that .
that tramp took me for everything !
congratulations .
i 'm sure your daughter 's looking forward to having you .
what you got there ? new comic book ?
l just retrieved it from my safe deposit box .
old comic books .
the sphere is nature 's perfect shape for resisting pressure .
over 16,000 pounds per square inch .
it 's taken.us three years to design and build this sphere .
it 's designed to scream down through the water column at high speed .
there are certain fish that actually will hover
deepsea challenger is not a stunt vehicle
there 's a hydraulic manipulator arm for taking samples .
there are push cores for taking sediment .
and two 3d cameras , one on the boom and one on the arm .
it 's just this kind of ragtag group
d one of the most amazing things about this vehicle
that 's enough to shear aircraft grade bolts .
so the sphere is actually held onto the sub by straps .
tr expedition ship just arrived
and we 've got some mechanical problems here
we 're tot going to com promise .
the most important thing is the weight system .
i need you to be closer to the camera .
so i make a movie called the abyss .
and so at that point , i think for the first time i stepped over a line
that was the first time i ever went really deep ,
i was struck by how surreal it was to actually be there
it was a real place where real people died ,
i really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration .
a core team that 's lasted over a decade .
amdrew wight has un all our expeditions since 200
the battleship bismarck .
yeah , copy . we are heading aft
it 's a grim place .
okay , elwood 's out . i 'm on the move .
you see that shell hole right there ?
you had an idea and you knew that it was underway .
oh , i 'm very excited . i mean , what took you so long ? 52 years , i mean
so don , do you have any tips for jim
i 'm not getting a reading on , the altimeter at
your sonar head is upside down ,
so pretty much everything that can be wired backwards is wired backwards .
we ' re not having a good time here .
okay , i think it 's time to descend one meter .
we can go ahead and terminate this test dive
okay , so the test in sydney harbour
but we 've got to get out of the harbor
copy that , deepsea challenger .
bottom , dropping shot to slow descent .
and touchdown .
depth 62 feet . over .
i remember jim walking straight across the deck to me
there was just such a devastation in his voice
they were my deep sea brothers
can 't get any closer . it was incredible .
maybe the consequences to our families are too great .
if you love people and you want to spend time with them , then do it .
it just goes . it just goes in a heartbeat .
deepsea challenger , you are now released .
i think my heart rate 's up a little bit at the moment
surface , deepsea challenger , do you copy ? over .
amazing . yeah .
see , these deep trenches are formed when one plate of the earth 's crust
the rock of the sea floor is grinding down underneath , right ,
so we came here and we saw , wow , look at what these forces
the same subduction forces that caused the rabaul eruptions
t 's a re ease of energy more than 3,000 times the hiroshima bomb ,
so we need the machines that can go down there .
depth is 12,164 feet . over .
no privately built sub has ever gone this deep .
guys , i 'm looking right into the starboard props here .
keep it tight .
and release , release , release .
you know , the divers become little tiny stick figures
you can see the plankton going by and ..
you can see the plankton going by and ..
everybody says i can 't stretch my arms out in here .
i 'll be at 18,000 feet here in a second
it 's cool .
a comms , we 're still receiving deepsea challenger
oh , see , look , this is not good . this is not good .
then they drive by themselves .
got a lot of failures here and i 'm coming up to my depth .
as i 'm going along , things are starting to fail and glitch one by one .
my clock 's stopped , my depth gauge has stopped , everything 's stopped .
i 've got just a couple of minutes to sort this out .
this is going to be a mess . yeah , a comms mermaid , a comms rib ,
i 'm going 2 knots .
270 feet . he 's getting really close .
stop !
hey , about time . finally
well , i have to say , guys , i picked you guys because you 're smart
and we 're going to think our way through it .
depth , 26,970 feet .
we did it , guys .
so i 'm five miles down in the new britain trench ,
and , bang , right off the bat i find what could be a new species of jellyfish .
we , don 't ive now , then weve wasted our time
because we re out of time .
steady .
now is where we really have to pit ourselves against the elements .
well , we 're supposed to be trying to dive by 0400 , which is in 20 minutes .
i 'll be descending by about 4 : 30 .
a little bit late , but not much
should be the deepest place on the planet .
but if you don 't go out and do something in life , nothing happens .
keep going , guys .
careful , donny . out more , donny .
deepsea challenger , you are 100 meters
hatch is not leaking .
yeah , jim , we 're going to , if you 're comfortable ,
copy , five minutes from drop zone .
yeah , copy that . vision 1 is 20-19-19 .
looking good , guys .
we got a hatch deploy on the soft ballast .
yeah roger , ' ve gotthatol can see that .
beyond any hope of rescue .
there 's nothing to do but sit and think
it 's peaceful . it 's lonely .
vertical rate is 1.3 knots .
get some speed off here .
488 feet to go .
on . good
altitude 110 feet .
surface , this is deepsea challenger .
depth is 35,756 feet .
everything looks good .
whatever i thought i was going to say at that moment
deepsea challenger . deepsea challenger .
love you too , baby . all the way from the heart of the ocean .
going deeper into the ocean is going deeper into the subconscious .
i know there are new species of bacteria in that sediment
looks like we got ourselves a big leak .
i better get my sample while i can .
okay , now ..
is it still ticking ?
all i can do is turn . turn in a circle .
it 's time to go back to my own world .
i hate this feeling , when you 've got to leave
surface , deepsea challenger .
well , i 'm just going to have to come back .
the faces of the guys who are just so proud
max , you just got another text from sebastian .
please , can we go to the club to see him dj , max ?
max , thank you so much for taking me dancing .
are you sure this is the address
this can 't be the address . it 's a whole foods .
i can smell the cage-free body odor .
organic !
this is why i didn 't want to know anything !
and what kind of loser comes here to dance ?
and i don 't mean the kosher bread !
whole foods is my sexy secret .
the organic preparation h in that basket .
why ? is chuck e. cheese closed ?
you mean dj fresh-and-local ?
let 's go . i can 't believe i wore these for this .
maybe he just drank too much .
there 's no dj fresh-and-local in my ones and twos .
you ran out of there without even saying " hi . "
he djs at a supermarket ,
uh , bar-back slash captain of a shrimp boat
who told you about the gap ?
fine ! i fell into the gap . i needed the money .
who ?
" oh , no you didn 't . "
speaking of neutered pets , here comes han .
hey , why wait till tuesday ?
i just need to find someone to cover me .
he did ! oh , my god ! max !
what ? do you wanna just join us ?
everyone knows on the job humiliation chain , it goes :
now if you 'll excuse me , i have got $ 14
this goes out to kelly in prepared foods .
now , where my adele-heads at ?
i 'm sorry , a what ?
yeah , turns out things aren 't great .
let me just weigh your salad .
'cause i 'm kind of killing it , life-wise .
well , that 's dinosaur kale .
you 're just putting it on the counter ?
is that not how it 's done ?
no , hilary , i have enough money .
fine , i 'll put it on facebook like a caveman .
that 's not a bad idea .
why ? because i 'm jewish ?
oh , but you did it so well .
it 's like watching a sculptor ,
i mean , seriously , you have got to let me scan your brain
thanks a lot . i can 't wait to do that .
well , it was an accident . i am so sorry i lied .
oh , you know , i also lied about the girl in the bathroom .
i don 't understand why i can 't talk at this meeting .
also , engineers aren 't real scientists ,
howard told me you were working late , so i brought dinner .
i spent my day alone in the lab
well , i came to see how you were feeling ,
my boss wants to meet with me , and i 'm stressing .
are you kidding ?
look at me ! listen to me !
i 've worked so hard to get where i am ,
it jammed before it made it to market .
you guys said something about body parts ?
it was mixed in with a lot of shredded stuff ,
got to be some mistake .
electronics , appliances , apparel ,
no . we don 't shred people .
well , we 've got cameras everywhere .
someone so much as gets a paper cut ,
we need to take a look at it .
plus we 're going to need to see what your " eyes " saw :
you can , uh , shred it when we 're done .
they fill them up at their offices ,
like i said , no one fell in .
if i was going to get rid of a body ,
yeah . looks like we 're in for a long day .
yeah , as my recent brush with t-rex confirms ,
yeah .
i know what you need , h .
yeah .
all right , guys , we got paper , plastic , metal ,
always a delight .
well , i enjoy a good puzzle now and again ,
hodges opened his big mouth .
can we , uh ... get to the goo ?
we 'll see what we get .
weight of the parts suggests that
put your nose down the scope .
well , a portion of the cranial bone
more than thinking . i also found this .
it stuck around .
we 'll run everything through ballistics ,
no way !
well , yeah , if it 's the larry lalotte .
" how much would you pay for peace of mind ?
for a monthly fee ,
since when do you worry about identity theft ?
all we are is zeroes and ones .
i 'm larry lalotte .
how much would you pay for ... ?
yes .
i 'm dead ?
better-looking , too , right ?
you got something to sell ,
wesley . works in the mailroom .
so , gentlemen , what about this dead thing ?
someone had force-fed him credit cards .
my name ? !
and the next thing i know , i got loans taken out in my name ,
you got an alibi ?
thanks to larry lamotte , there 's a half dozen guys
yeah .
those are my numbers on my computer .
there are plenty of legit companies doing this , but .
yeah .
and you need one , so you figure , why not ?
hodges ..
oh , of course not , no .
so , the older fragment is from a different gun .
how ?
it shows signs of encapsulation .
so far , we have nothing to identify our shredder guy .
nobody 's perfect . kind of looks like a chia pet .
weren 't able to pull a print , though ?
might get something now .
julius kaplan and a john doe in an alley
and then kills him with a glock .
two crimes , same shooter ?
it doesn 't make sense , catherine .
so , why would an identity thief come all the way to vegas
maybe he just wanted a free trip to vegas on larry 's dime .
either way , something else is going on .
" why kill a penny-ante thief ? "
facial recognition got a hit on shredder guy .
check out the name .
the real larry lamotte .
see this cartridge case ?
it has all the personal information we need to identify you .
burglary , fraud , and identity theft .
hello , arlo karden .
step away from the car .
that 's what they say .
the all-knowing executive assistant .
you knew the real larry .
you knew about your boss withdrawing five million bucks .
saw an opportunity for a little quid pro quo .
just like my boss .
except then , it was about holding on to my job .
" honey , can you pick up my dry cleaning " ?
i need a little help with something . "
he confirms someone accessed one of his accounts .
and with five million dollars missing , well ..
and thanks to i.d-preserve ,
exactly .
mm . my mother wouldn 't approve ;
it 's just so hard to tell what will look good on me .
you know , do-do you want something simple and elegant ?
ooh , we 're talking about trains .
i defy you to name a train that i don 't like .
i did not see that coming . good job .
what should i wear ?
how much money are you asking for ?
then i 'd go no bra .
i have figured out an experimental design
just nod .
i mean , they won 't even give me that much
but i need it . it 's the only way to settle the contradictions
well , what if i ask for it in six easy installments
so , uh , what do you say ?
he said no ?
you 're gonna have to double down .
higgs had to wait almost 50 years
but i want to play with it now .
take that , mom .
is it possible that the very first dress is the dress ?
you can 't buy the first dress you try on .
okay , well , you know ,
it 's never felt the touch of a man before .
of course i don 't want to sell these .
okay . uh , why don 't you leave these here with me ,
sure .
hey , i can 't believe you just threw me under the bus .
well ...
if 's ... it 's wow .
i loved the macaroni necklace he made me in first grade .
people are gonna think i played for the knicks in the ' 70s .
it 's 100 % class .
all right .
so , i 've narrowed it down to swiss coffee
i thought we landed on eggshell .
w-why don 't we just sell the house ?
you were at that science fair .
this is for our lily .
" lily is testing
we 're just deciding if she 's gonna skip a grade .
well , no , choices have consequences .
okay , why do all your meltdowns
i am ...
he gave me bangs .
hopefully you 're all cried out .
dad , we got to start getting ready for the graduation .
do you guys remember that " luke loves daddy " rap ?
dad , please , you really got to stop .
mama , now my tooth hurts .
what if it 's my leg ?
as a matter of fact , i am .
he loves dinosaurs ,
oh , do you have to go so soon ?
yeah , you 're like two sniffs away from a felony .
i gave phil such a hard time
luke used to love coming here .
the one outside is yours ?
the girl that was sitting on manny 's lap
and he teaches manny how to be a dog !
hey , look at me ! i 'm about to talk to a stranger !
ugh . it wasn 't this depressing last night .
excuse me .
this is a fun game , isn 't it ? but you know what ?
congratulations on the first
thanks for helping me with the cap-and-gown mess .
gotcha .
i learned how to fight .
social services came when i was 12 years old and took me away .
yeah , he kind of reminds me
good times , right ?
i know . it 's not your job to save her .
i can 't get reception on this thing
we do this all the time .
we 're gonna have a fucking circus on our hands .
what are we gonna do ?
dr. ray , please pick up line two .
i 'm really tired of everybody letting me down all the time .
i mean ..
and if anyone doesn 't appreciate that ,
that 's very sweet .
l know a shortcut .
there are many ways for tragedy and violence
they can grow weak , they can grow strong .
what other side is that ?
you understand ? we do this one thing .
one fucking thing , jimmy .
are we good ?
fucking hands in the air , motherfucker !
move it ! open the goddamn safe !
taking risks for what ? for money .
that 's right .
i would 've done the same thing .
living all these years , just thanking people .
thanking a priest for his blessings .
thanking god .
gary won 't sign my petition unless i sign his .
where were we ?
i got the power suit , the corner office .
but one important decision ,
i sing . i saw you singing
write what you care about , what you 're afraid of .
is that what you write about ? the truth ?
mostly to god .
i 'm writing one right now for a girl , and this girl , man , she is ..
write what you love , yeah ? get after it .
i 've been listening to this ginny owens song
has chosen something bigger for me ,
i am so scared .
if one person 's life is changed by what i go through ...
look , man . i should 've told you .
which means i have a lot of time to think
ancient stories , still relevant and true .
yet to another , his call is to suffer , and even die
each is the stroke of a brush on his beautiful canvas .
and i think i 'm one of those lucky people
it led to the perfect day with you .
and god is worth trusting .
all right , you may talk in the bedroom ,
but keep in mind i 'll be right out here
leonard , when you get this message , call me .
when you get this , tell leonard to check his voicemail .
because you 're welcome to .
who i can and can 't have a relationship with .
the hindu code of manu is very clear in these matters .
the code also states
we believe this stuff .
some of it makes sense , some of it 's crazy .
who can 't go out with leonard ?
penny , this is rai 's sister , priya .
oh . then perhaps you don 't understand what 's going on .
arguably much more suitable than you .
hey , what do you mean , " more suitable " ?
i 'm doing research on emotions and brain activity .
then i 'm going to stimulate the analogous area
i choose you .
yep . i moved out of my mother 's house .
what did she say when you told her ?
this is so great .
you got all the talent in the world and all you wanna do is mess around .
to help bring our product into the city .
three bins a month .
and all they gotta do is make sure they pass through without inspection .
heroin .
the very best in the world .
very interested .
twenty years ago , i made a living , the same way we all did .
.. but mostly i was a grinder .
you know what that butcher shop ts today'
why are you telling me this ?
i am a legitimate businessman now .
that 's why i 'm here .
whoa , whoa , whoa . hey , hey . wait ! come on , now .
take the night to think it over . once you 've considered it more carefully ..
everyone i came up with is either dead
it 's christmastime
take this shit with you .
we paid you to guarantee your father 's support .
i 'll be stopping by your house tonight to pick up our money .
fucking garbage . i hate albanians .
did you even listen to what he had to say ?
shut your mouth . i 'm talking to my father .
the problem is , all i ever hear out of your mouth ..
and now i bring you a piece of business , a good piece of business
when i was younger ..
i made so much money bringing cocaine into the city
until i couldn 't recognize them anymore .
not enough money in the world to pull me back in .
i can 't just walk away .
oint pleasant .
you were in this one with ..
maureen galvin
you get enough to eat ?
he retired
maybe you should 've taken a bite out of that pie harding
what 's the number , tim ?
i always thought it was more . i made a list once . all the names .
seventeen .
but that was yours .
i get a letter from his widow
i got stacks of those letters crowding my fucking desk .
why don 't you whisper it to me . what 's the number , jim ?
i think you should call your dad .
off the face new jersey in control , henricue .
and he gets the puck all the way down near the goal line .
gabby ? goddamn it !
hello .
what are you doing here ?
talk to the police yet ?
we both know why i 'm here michael .
you stay out of my house , you understand me ?
so , what , they sent you to keep me quiet ?
where 's your family ?
i want you to drive there . make sure they 're safe .
wow .
i 'm gonna talk to shawn .
thank you .
sorry , i didn 't know what to do . i didn 't want him to die .
witness couldn 't identify the shooter .
and all of that ended an hour ago , when you killed my son .
i won 't let you take him , shawn .
and when it 's done , and it will be done .
you 're looking me in the eyes right now ...
listen , i came home a few times . your mom and i tried to work things out .
and i 'd find a gun hidden in every room in the house .
this is frice .
two people . i 'll double your quote .
the whole city 's hunting them down . i need you to get there first .
michael and jimmy conlon .
you want the job or not ?
that bad , huh ? since when do you give a shit if i 'm happy ?
then you don 't feel so guilty about leaving .
yeah .
i 'd be happier if i were still fighting , but .
you didn 't have the killer instinct to make a top-class fighter , mike .
you were ahead at the end of the fourth , and you stopped using your jab .
that 's life . it don 't offer any do-overs .
could you check on her for me ?
317 . i have the keys right here .
and you 're sure conlon 's in there ?
out !
i copy that vector .
is he fucking here ? !
you pull that trigger , you 're no better than i am .
and we work our way back in .
come on .
i got it .
thanks .
what the hell happened to you ?
one of them had a knife this long
mom is in the hospital again .
yeah
cops come here , asking me have i seen you ?
so , what 's going on ?
mike and i need to lay low for a while .
now you 're gonna bring michael into this ?
who you running from this time , huh ?
i killed his son
it 's not his fault . he 's trying to get me out .
he 's only loyal to one person . he 's gonna turn you over to shawn .
he killed his own cousin for shawn maguire .
i 'm talking about your cousin billy .
for god 's sake , jimmy .
billy had problems .
what the fuck are you doing here ?
i 'd get the hell out of here , if i were you
it 's over michael
that you didn 't have any part in all this .
hey , come on . let 's go .
i didn 't want you to come .
i didn 't want you to see this .
can you blame him ? he 's your nephew .
and he 's not the only one who 's starting to feel that way , michael .
one minute .
you just put the book in that woman 's hand .
justice and punishment are the same thing to her .
then will you please tell me what 's going through your head .
i 've known you all my life .
veronica ...
you 've been good to me my whole life .
given your lack of prior criminal conduct
for that reason
i 'm willing to honour that .
level one ?
i would ask counsel fo refrain from interrupting me .
when you hear the knock , step out . keep the line moving .
no more talking in line .
keep that line moving.keep it moving.move it . right now .
next down in the banks , dress . let 's go
we got two commandments and two only .
where can i find him ?
and in a month he 's getting the chair .
there a way i can get to him ?
i can 't . that 's it .
that 's the date they , uh , you know ... execute me .
i didn 't kill that man , michael .
maybe you oughta hear what i gotta say .
wouldn 't be foo sure of that .
just what i need . a duck .
you re not related , are you ?
as a doctor , no less .
" be the change you want to see in the world . "
that was you ?
you 're very funny .
put direct pressure on that . i 'll be back in a sec .
you hook me up with a few weeks ' supply ?
i mean , are you having second thoughts ?
i don 't know .
it 's not .
and i wanna be your wife .
hey , you went for it .
that 's me from now on .
" yes , " " no " " love , " " hate ... " " love . "
" yes " " no . " " love , " " hate .. " " love . "
no good , fish .
not unless he 's real interested in what you got going on .
magna cum laude , in fact .
past tense for you , maybe . not me .
even with all the stuff that was going on with him ,
don 't do this .
there 's a better way.i 'm already appealing your case .
that won 't stop it . it 'll only delay it .
you find out who 's trying to bury him .
the evidence was there .
visiting hours are now over .
someone wants him dead , veronica .
maybe . but i can 't watch him die.i won 't do that .
what is it about the burrows situation that i can help you with ?
i wouldn 't say it 's great , or influence .
it 's also our understanding that you oppose the death penalty .
it 'd be a shame for the 8th wonder of the modern
how much work are we talking ?
yes .
it 's better than being here .
you think it 's me . it 's you .
punished the old man cos he was gone .
i 'm not asking you to love me .
you can still put the brakes on this thing .
okay . estabien
you went to loyola .
i like to get to know my patients .
sixteen more months .
be easy , son , all right ?
what do you need , man ?
i only speak english , white boy
you can get that at medical , then .
why not ?
was hard on both father and son .
with yuki gone , ken 's gone off the rails .
so it is only natural that those closest to him get the brunt of it .
he 's been expelled for fighting three times .
i believe a problem shared is a problem halved .
go back , seek balance and save your company .
and your bond will grow stronger .
thank you very much .
come on .
what are you doing ?
it 's fine . he needed checking .
these two boys have formed a great friendship .
they no regard each other as brothers .
when 's he coming back ?
this is a long hike . maybe even a couple of days .
oh , man .
ryu , you probably wouldn 't make it on your own .
finally some civilization . ryu , we must check out this town .
this one . by the us military base .
are you taking this seriously or not ?
i was wondering when you might arrive .
the death of a warrior , in combat .
you both now hold the torch that soke gotetsu once carried
are you there ?
to generate hado , with devastating effect .
shoryuken ..
for the shoryuken one must generate a sudden surge of ki energy ...
this hado will allow your muscles to contract with extraordinary force
on a separate surge of ki into your punching fist .
will make it nearly indestructible for that moment
quite the opposite .
ken ! 50 push-ups now !
drive your ki into your hands . try this ..
5000 yen each to fight .
welcome to ono 's fighting tournament .
come on , 6et him .
johnsonl we got ourselves a couple of karate kids running their mouths .
don 't worry .
it 's your funeral , boy .
i do ?
master
that is for ien to decide .
that 's because i 'm just an afterthought to you .
it doesn 't mean anything
i want to make up for lost time .
and like him , i have to finish it .
for now , till training 's finished , this is my home
thanks
he will give us some pointers before he leaves . you 're up for it ?
what are you doing here ?
where is he ?
he is your brother ,
he stubborn fool has done this himself
what are you so afraid of ?
he has returned
who are you ?
i am not important
my duty here is done ,
it will take more than that , my friend .
sensei just brought you back to life
or still in a fight .
master , you were saying ?
we 'll continue when you return . go .
i 'm okay .
first i will put your cubs down .
fine ,
when the time is perfect , you will know .
i promise you .
that is the man who killed my master .
i am a veteran of the last great war of our time .
you cannot follow its words literally .
why ?
shun goku satsu , the pinnacle of mastery of satsui no hado
to protect gouken and you .
your body is twisted by the power of satsui no hado .
it 's perfect .
shall not rest until dark hado is mine .
but maybe your uncle is right .
so you think we should just give up ?
even if we could find goki ,
i know you care for him . i do too ,
we have to accept it , and move on .
uncle .
you were right .
i have no choice .
nature provides all that i need .
i 've been speaking to master .
he advised me to go on the musha shugyo , he warrior 's pilgrimage .
not for a while ,
i want you with me , sayaka .
last night .... . i felt something strange ..
go on .
i prayed that this day would never come .
that of goki
goki had ambitions of unlocking the power of dark hado ,
unlocking it would require such focus of satsui no hado ..
no one has ever survived ic .
or the birth of something legendary .
the birth of an akuma demon
he will come .
jet 's take a walk
it is time you left this place
i wish words could explain ,
be strong
under my guidance , you have become pioneers of the ansatsuken line
you should now be mentally preparing to leave this place .
that you can 't learn for yourself on your warrior 's filgrimage .
stupid foreigner . you can 't do it , ryu is too strong for you .
ryu .
shut up ! you 've been saying that for a year , you senile old bastard !
right , i start .
how was it ?
do that thing , or this thing , or this thing
you couldn 't do it after all
thanks , shisho .
oh shit , man . mega man 2 .
hey ! can 't you hear me ?
how do you like me now , asshole ?
you keep your ki and emotions locked deep inside ,
there is a strength deep within you ,
shoryuken .
ryul , turn and face me .
if that 's how you wanna play it .
maybe this will .
shoryuken .
master !
oh , jesus . thank god .
ryu , you hear me ? you okay ?
ken , ryu needs his rest now .
satsui no fado .
i didn 't , i swear .
when i arrived , i saw you descend from a form of shoryuken ..
your fist , as you can see , was on fire .
i need to know how you tapped into dark hado .
shall we ?
now the time 's come , i kinda don 't wanna go .
i 'm trying to keep an open mind .
wait till the world gets a load of us , man .
smile .
give my regards to your father , ken . he has been a good friend .
and thank you , ken . i 'll see you before long .
to be under your guidance as a student of the martial arts ..
senzo .. i owe much to you .
and helped me find peace at a time .
you have seen more of the ansatsuken legacy
j have seen much
as you have served mine .
has now been paid .
you have my eternal gratitude .
it has been an honour to serve you .
you do want to go , don 't you ?
just checking .
but not if i 'm going to get shot or blown up .
let me think about lf
he picked me up
so much for the truth .
paid for it in blood
damned if we do , damned if we don 't .
can 't be done .
we tried everything
it 's impossible .
all we can do is survive ,
any other ideas will just get people killed ,
you understand , major ?
i didn 't te ther .
i didn 't tell her . really ?
i 'm afraid a hae to love you and leave you .
okay ? not in this
i don 't give a shit .
hey , you believe in god ?
you believe in anything ?
hey , you got kids ?
you know , i thought i would someday .
no , we gotta go to ghost city .
it goes real deep .
i saved them , max ! i saved them .
she was running for her life .
filthy .
i 'll speak as loud as i want .
what is the matter with her ?
what are you brats looking at ?
hey , lover boy ! can we get on with the game now ?
and what makes you think you are good enough for my daughter ?

they never found his body .
but how can a mother give up ?
i have to go .

jeven rhicler 's .
then he needs to get up and move about .
why not ?
he can 't lay still forever . he needs to be moved .
the mouth on it ! because i say so .
and what do you propose ?
it 's more than i deserve
i 'm sorry , there 's no bed .
you feel free to do your lessons whenever you want .
i 'm just downstairs . i 'm not going anywhere .

we should call it a night .
listen to your father .
oh , you 're too soft on that girl .
ta 's al i had
my god .
shut up !
i haven 't starved us all for the better part of two years .
it 's my fault .
it was my idea to build that snowman .
because we had to .
you promised .
" one wintry day ...
the last snowfall "
" seemed to look inside him and finger his guilt .
fe had cut himself loose .
for what ? having a diary ?
come on !

i 'm here to talk about your son , rudy .
ie lives next door .

and watched the sun rise .
oh , liesel .
what is it , my girl ?
it 's nice to hear you play .
i 'm going to bed .
your mama told me what you did .
all i have learned is that life makes no promises .
i have always tried to ignore it .
outside the car , the world was thrown inside a snow-shaker .
he lived under our stairs like a quiet owl with no wings .
the book floated down the river
good night , your majesty .
dark and formidable .
no one intended to destroy a street named after heaven .
no sirens that evening
so you gotta help me.you gotta do something .
you took an oath .
oh , sorry .
most residents came to help promote health and well-being ,
and they came to consult with one another about a possible cure .
have you guys noticed how friendly betty 's been
i just know those two have something to do with that dead body .
well , the paper said the police are withholding the details .
that 's a great idea .
look at this , a-b negative .
well , there must be something in the water around these parts .
seriously ?
they 're just thriving .
such a shame i may not be around to enjoy them .
and matthew and i ,
we just don 't know yet .
oh , back in chicago .
you 've already done so much .
that dr . ron called .
he needs to see me or he wants to see me ?
" now i think it 's time we talk about your hip replacement . "
play to your strengths .
what 's wrong ? pat said youtold her it was an emergency !
i fee
even just for one day ?
jonas , your turn for feelings .
terrified
i apologize to my community .
number 52 , please step forward .
jones has been selected .
jonas possesses all four attributes :
pain far beyond anything we know .
do we think jonas is brave enough ?
thank you for your childhood .
one : report directly to the receiver of memory
you may ask any question .
injected . 8-7-5-2 .
yours look so important .
well , yeah , there 's only one receiver of memory .
what did they say again ?
he said faith , that was seeing beyond .
don 't accept .
i feel completely stupid .
prick your finger and put a little blood on this apple .
if you quit your position , you get sent to elsewhere .
it 'll find your blood and think it 's your hand .
fiona , i need you to do this . i need you to feel what i know it 's ...
an apple wouldn 't even work .
don 't quit .
don 't show me a map and then not give me all the memories .
we will , but we must move slow
i gave her the memory of a child ...
the light went from her eyes .
and now lives in blsewhere ?
i would like to see this morning 's release .
giver !
i 'd have to be sleeping to wake up .
what are you proposing ?
i need to find the boundary of memory .
set up a communication with the receiver of memory .
we can only transmit .
if you go , head towards the triangle ,
tiona ,
i 'm taking gabe . we 're leaving the community .
there you go .
so much more .
fiona , what do you feel ?
please secure your work area and immediately report
jonas , jonas , jonas , jonas , jonas ,
we must not say his name any more
and a hippo is really an elephant .
what i 'm about to tell you ,
but the ceremony of loss ?
i don 't expect you to understand ,
he must not get beyond the triangle of rocks .
hey .
nothing the giver had shown me
the only way to help them ,
i 've taken care of everything .
there 'll be a nice ceremony .
it was flat .
first time a teacher 's ever called me flat .
oh , i thought you were han .
nicolas is here .
he can 't be in my personal life !
did i just call the diner my personal life ?
so what do i tell him ?
tell him what we had was a passing flirtation .
got it , you died in a grease fire .
oh , well , will she be coming ?
let 's go . let 's go , let 's go , let 's go , let 's go .
what 's the hurry ?
we need to leave now ,
i said everything i needed to say to him in my last text .
so i 've been hiding in the stairwell all day .
a room where ten vietnamese women
i don 't .
excuse me , john . this is private .
i know . that 's why i 'm standing here .
aw , that 's sweet . you got him antibiotics ?
i just have to make it down the hall
cool , maybe call jen next time
you know , a couple kisses , a dry hump here and there .
exactly . i 'm not the type of person
yes ! yes , that 's me !
i almost lost my virginity 25 times .
max , i have to figure out what to do about nicolas
it 's just a thing you say
i know , right ?
no . i 've told dozens of women
that was nice of oleg .
oh , i feel so much better .
no , why would he leave her for you ?
max , i just got another text from nicolas
you got a timeframe ?
well , i can understand how that would make someone irritable .
interesting. fact : " etymology "
and why are you two laughing ?
he 's dressed as you for halloween .
is something bothering you ?
oh . well , that must have felt terrible .
oh , i don 't think that 's true .
i think it is about sheldon .
going to mit ? his magic ?
well , he should . it 's stupid .
i think the point is that howard owes him an apology .
mama .
oh , that 's great .
yep . he interprets me .
the bill of tights .
hey , bert , what are you dressed as ?
my work in seismic refraction measurements and ...
i 'm a butterfly .
i 'm gonna put them back .
i 'm maurice " doc " ewing , winner of the 1960 vetlesen prize ,
ask me how i died .
well , gorblimey .
can 't believe amy did that .
that was totally different .
that didn 't hurt my feelings .
those pants i wore to make fun of you were so tight ,
oh , we 'd be happy to apologize to her
don 't you think it 's unreasonable
i don 't understand . if it 's unreasonable ,
really ? star wars ?
well , chewbacca was losing and getting angry and ...
if you don 't have them boys from the 369th ,
that 's an order !
they haven 't hit a target in this goddamn war .
well , we , uh , we cleared out sector three here , sir .
also , um , the .. the boys from the 40th , they ...
some of them didn 't even have rifles .
yeah , there are machine guns that we had to get by .
great way to end the war .
yeah . i didn 't join the army
oh , you think they like being called that ?
yeah . where are you from again ?
what did you call me ?
the hell you guys do in missoula , montana ?
i like warm beer .
thank you , lieutenant . to the cellar .
come in .
not at all . come on in .
i 'm fixing it .
well , yeah . but she got a lot of life left in her .
drop it , cardinni , all right ? leave him be .
you 'd see it right to give us our freedom .
yes , sir .
oh , all right .
uh , back home i was studying to be a priest .
ahem . back at the church i studied at ...
the priest would ask them what they all wanted to be when they grew up .
and i don 't understand it . i don 't know what it is .
but when we took that german line ...
instead of being a leader , i , uh ...
i wanted to run , i wanted to leave the war .
couple of b.a.rs , rifles , grenades , enough ammunition to last .
uh , and these captured german machine guns .
we .. we are here , all right ?
where is that ?
it also bumps up along those trees
we put our machine guns on the north side , just below the crest .
right , that 's why we bait the germans .
i didn 't save anyone .
you didn 't owe me anything .
sometimes all you need is just a little encouragement to get through it .
captain , your men are a bit jumpy .
he 's clean , sir .
by all means .
you cannot beat southern american tobacco .
always to the point , americans .
explain .
eleven in the morning .
clearly , you can see your position here is pointless ,
i think we 're gonna stay .
we 've found two sets so far .
we didn 't want to disturb their environment ,
based on what ?
so if they 're not from here ...

perhaps that is why your
our ... adversary and ..
abraham lincoln has asked us to work with him

he claimed , as tyrants do ,
and radical republicanism 's abolitionist fanaticism !

unknown to me . seems jumpy .
but all that was not enough for this dictator ,
john ellis is going to break his watch if he doesn 't stop .
nay , commanded to consider a proposed thirteenth amendment .
what 's more interesting is

it 's not quite exactly what i intend ,
for patience , i expect .

and i look a lot worse without my wig .
to lead them ! and i lead ! you ought to try it !
if i 've listened to you , i 've declared every slave free
oh god , how you have longed to say that to me .
but you know what the people are .
white people cannot bear the thought of sharing
if in pursuit of your destination ,
robert 's gonna plead with us to let him enlist .
so is robert .
plenty of boys younger than robert signing up .
don 't let me lose my son .
secretary stanton has sent over to tell you
terry 's got ten thousand men surrounding the goddamned fort ,
it 's the largest fort they have , sir .
that might suffice to discourage him .
not in a fight like this . this is to the death .
are you despairing , or merely lazy ?
nothing " suffices "
while we hope to be saved by " the national mood " ? !
get him to proclaim what we all know he believes in his coal-colored heart :

i 've asked you a question , mr. stevens ,
is that not the true purpose of the amendment ?
the true purpose of the amendment , mr. wood ,
the true purpose of the amendment ..
that 's not so ! you .
you 've said it a thousand times ..
it is in fact , unworthy of a white man !

we 'll pay for the oceans of spilled blood you 've sanctioned ,
robert will never forgive himself . you imagine he 'll forgive us
that 's right . when you refused so much as to comfort tad ..
i was holding him ..
in my arms as he died !
and his mother won 't let him near her ,
howling at shadows and furniture and ghosts !
then do it ! !

i don 't envy him his task .
then you 'll see to it .
if we succeed ?
you have a right to expect what i expect ,
but what you are to the nation ,
negroes have been fighting and dying for freedom
freedom 's a first .
my son died , fighting for the union ..
for freedom he died .

buzzards ' guts , man .

this is precisely what mr. wood wishes me to respond to ?
yes , sir .
i feel , um , i have to say , mr. lincoln , that this ...
you gonna have a chat now ,
it 's , it 's ...
all our traditions will be obliterated .
we ain 't here to discuss reconstruction .
but i don 't want to deal falsely .
and the leaders , jeff and the rest of ' em .
when peace comes it mustn 't just be hangings .
some weariness has bit at my bones .
never seen the like of it before .
intimate , and ugly .
we 've made it possible for one another to do terrible things .
now you have to lead us out of it .
i 'd like that .
come on , please ?
he would 've let her hang there .
it might be an impromptu wedding .
or a make-believe pregnancy .
until something comes along to remind them that other people have secrets , too .
how is she ? what did the doctors say ?
what the hell happened ? how could she pull a stunt like this ?
oh , sweetie .
it 's like mary alice all over again .
i know it 's her wedding night , but do you think we should call gaby ?
gaby ?
let 's run away together .
there are 200 people out there waiting for me to lead a conga line .
i can 't dump him on our wedding day .
i 'm at the hospital .
oh , my god ! is she okay ?
okay , that 's all right .
look , maybe in a couple weeks .
no ! it has to be tonight !
and edie 's on a ventilator .
oh , my god.katherine .
i cannot believe it has been 12 years .
well , you clearly have.your eyesight 's going .
katherine used to live here with mrs.sims .
what a beautiful family .
no , i am the lucky one .
your garden is absolutely breathtaking .
it 's my pride and joy .
and all you lovely newcomers .
if i really was 8 12 months pregnant .
don 't you look radiant !
she 's very sensitive down there .
you know , in my day , mothers thought that it was good luck .
bree , you 're hurting me !
no , not at all !
why must old ladies always do that ?
i 'm sorry susan .
his new partner is covering for him , if you 're comfortable with that .
i 'm just here for a checkup .
look there 's a simple blood test we can use to find out .
i am not old enough for menopause .
harvard medical school , class of . ' 97 ?
i am old !
we will live in these woods till our work is done .
you okay ?
god save all ye merry men !
no you said you did .
what if you change it back ?
listen , my last egg could be on its way down the chute at this very moment .
you mean that i tried to hang myself .
the doctor encouraged me to talk about it .
well , carlos and i talk about it all the time .
we 've actually talked about marriage .
i 'm katherine mayfair your new neighbor .
so , again , best wishes .
she 's not real good with disappointment .
you told me you wanna run away together , and then i don 't hear from you for a month !
yes !
we are not throwing in the towel over a minor mishap .
today , a magic fork in the belly .
we 're already in too deep .
you got what you came for .
you left out a key piece of information , didn 't you ?
question is , why 'd you let us in at all ?
an audition for what ?
we extracted every bit of information you had in there .
we don 't have time for this . i 'm getting off at kyoto .
yeah , well , i don 't like trains .
yes , hello ?
hey , guys . hey . how are you ? how you doing , huh ?
okay ? who 's just okay ? is that you , james ?
well , i can 't , sweetheart . i can 't . not for a while , remember ?
look , i told you , i 'm away because i 'm working , right ?
can you do it ?
because i can find my own way to square things with cobol .
then i choose to leave , sir .
hey , mr. cobb .
to america . to your children .
why not ?
... is the easiest way to lose your grasp
listen to me .
that why you need me to build your dreams ?
cobb ! cobb !
how 's your handwriting ?
good .
inception .
interesting . because arthur keeps telling me it can 't be done .
he is good at what he does , right ?
not like you .
let me ask you something . have you done it before ?
you didn 't plant it deep enough ?
you need the simplest version of the idea ...
well , she 'd sabotage the whole operation .
no . no , they don 't .
no one said it 's getting worse .
why can 't you go home ?
for not asking whether i did .
.. which is why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious .
we need to find a way to translate this into an emotional concept .
that 's what we 're here to figure out , right ?
i thought about calling out to them ...
.. those beautiful faces of theirs , but it 's all too late .
then i start to panic .
that i need to see their faces one last time .
get us another seat on the plane .
.. when we land , i go to jail for the rest of my life .
... i make one phone call from the plane ..
i 'm sorry .
thank you .
would you care for a drink ?
oh , um , same , please .
thank you .
all right . taxi . thank you .
what are you doing ? sorry , i thought it was free .
maybe we could share .
great .
there 's $ 500 in there . the wallet 's worth more than that .
i 'm afraid that it doesn 't
what the hell is going on ?
cobb ?
are you all right ?
don 't tell me to calm down !
you were meant to check fischer 's background !
we have dealt with sub-security before !
this was not a part of the plan ! he 's dying .
no , don 't do that ! don 't do that .
he 's in agony . i 'm waking him up .
when we die in a dream , we wake up .
we 're too heavily sedated to wake up that way .
we drop into limbo .
limbo ?
forget it . we go any deeper , we just raise the stakes .
fischer 's security is surrounding this place .
that means each and every one of us will be killed .
we have no other choice but to continue on
maurice told me that when he passed , you were the only one able to open it .
maybe he did . i mean , maybe you just didn 't know it was a combination .
i don 't know , some meaningful combination of numbers ...
we should probably get out of here .
pay attention to the strangeness of the weather , the shift in gravity .
now , the easiest way for you to test yourself .
yeah , i ..
accept the fact that you 're in a dream , and i 'm here to protect you . go on .
no . i 'm a projection of your subconscious .
.. that extractors tried to pull you into a dream .
yeah .
can you get me out of here ?
hold on a second .
these men were sent here to abduct you , all right ?
i need you to work with me , mr. fischer .
i wouldn 't do that if i were you , mr. fischer .
you 're in the back of a van . keep going .
something to do with a safe .
it 's like trying to remember a dream after you 've woken up .
you and browning have been pulled into this dream ..
i need you to focus and try and remember what that is .
a combination . they demanded the first numbers to pop into my head .
it can represent anything . we 're in a hotel right now .
try and remember for me . this is very important .
while you 're all asleep in 528 , i wait for yusuf 's kick .
his music warns me .
so we get a nice synchronized kick .
but if it 's too late , i won 't be able to drop us .
does the strong room have windows ?
let 's hope fischer likes what he finds in there .
yes .
no . they 're just projections .
don 't do this , mal . please . those aren 't my children .
no , i know it .
what if i 'm what 's real ?
but what do you believe ?
guilt .
and no matter what i do , no matter how hopeless i am ...
what truth ?
you planted the idea in my mind ?
the reason i knew inception was possible
all mirror , no toilet .
she was born rich ,
" hey , everybody , look , look what i 'm doing .
do you know where we are ?
life is so funny .
and now you clean up their poop .
here 's the apartment upstairs tomorrow .
how do i look ?
i don 't think it 's him .
i don 't think sophie likes me .
no . i don 't think she has a blind spot .
well , i think we 've found the place
look . do you know what that means ?
oh , my god , do you think
here 's a note .
" wake me when you get here . " he wants us to wake him .
i 'm the reason we even have cupcake jobs .
who stayed up all last night baking 24 more cupcakes
i did . me . the balloon .
and now , i 'm going to float down this hall
free model penis is my reward for doing everything
hey , stop !
good thing i stopped by to check on you .
you explain it .
he left a note . just doing my job .
so , you think i 'm holding max back ?
look , i don 't know what to expect .
i could be inheriting a motel 6
thanks , vic .
and fun is just the kind of therapy we all need .
yeah .
wanna start the healing process ?
you 've checked yourself six times this morning
we weren 't expecting your friends , but , um .
oh , we 're just the first wave .
how are we even gonna find our way around in there ?
ain 't nothing we haven 't heard before .
so you really are brother and sister ?
we can make more , if you 'd like .
we 'll leave you here to rest a spell while we figure out
go on , sit down .
why , what 's wrong ?
it won 't be long , and you can all have at ' em as much as you like .
do i make myself clear ? do you understand me ?
so , like , what 's the plan with the cameras , dude ?
yeah , man . look . compact and easy to hide .
no . like i said , we just got here , so .
oh , well , our friend inherited it .
" tell you what .
i guess this place just gives me the creeps .
you ok
that guy kind of looks like danny .
the whole history of this hotel 's up here .
these pictures only go up to the ' 70s .
not everybody , though . look .
why the hell are they all covered ud ?
i 'm just saying , there 's bound
you think ' cause we 're mountain folk , our ways ain 't fit for fine society ?
you think ' cause we 're mountain folk , our ways ain 't fit for fine society ?
not one had a como aint !
it 's ok , jackson . really .
i 'm sorry . i 'm just very proud of my heritage .
yeah
man , that 's tight .
never been hunting , period .
that 's hardly a proper view , miss ,
fit ok ?
i knew you would .
she 's just being protective . they all are .
bryan ? we used to work together ,
not everybody thought so .
definitely not my clients .
including bryan 's , toni 's , my own .
the ones who stand by you .
no , not them .
where men can 't get to it .
lure , entice the deer over your ways .
you let your prey come to you ,
you 're bleeding . so are you .
we 've gotta get out of here . he saw my face .
not anymore , i 'm not .
i do make it myself .
we 'll be right back . i 'm gonna wash this off of my hands .
all right , it 's oi . i can do it .
o rine .
i 'd say you 're strong enough .
you just have some aches that need rubbing out .
there 's no sense waiting .
it 's not. where 's the peroxide ?
you going .
because it looks like you rolled around in blood
get that thing out of my face .
keep that shit away from me too .
i saw.what ?
zou . dude !
you know what i saw today ? civil war era .
you said you were game for writing a book about the history of this place .
we build awareness .
what do you say , man ?
we 'll carve him up later .
you 'll be in me , one way or another
i 'm gonna need some more paper .
where is danny ?
check the front desk
others tried to chisel in on what we 'd earned ,
what 's that ?
see , like this brew , hobb springs is a testament to family .
with them came others .
and they bring temptation to stray .
i do know blake superficially
the lamb represents innocence
the tiger lives on blood and murder
you read blake like the devil reads the bible .
the lamb has been bestowed with the honor of living
somewhat reckless , i should think
mr. sophistication ? of course !
i sent the picture to the local paper
when i was ten years old , i discovered
but what about repentance , jack ?
i repent nothing
not to mention the trophy parade , practiced primarily
shh . george , wait .
okay , george , you want to shoot ?
fire !
to fell an animal of this size
an animal could run a great distance
jack !
i 'm here , jack .
there 's a sour taste in my mouth .
it 's the acid you are starting to taste .
i 'm afraid you are going to have to get used to it .
.... for quite a bit .
.. than it would be to you .
why is it always the man 's fault ?
without even having harmed a single kitten .
if one is so unfortunate ..
think of the injustice in that .
and men , they are always the criminals .
i want you to leave .
why are they always so stupid ?
come on .
but you only talk about the stupid women
you feel superior to women and want to brag ?
no , no , but women are easier .
more cooperative .
if you like .
most people would say , it 's the natural breakdown
but this is where mr. sophistication
you reduce everything human to matter
you kill art by imposing your moral ruler on life
there is no avoiding it , is there ?
in order to achieve the most sublime sweetness
.. why should destruction and demolition
which fortunately were smashed to atoms
but an artist must be cynical
the value of icons .
notice the sound when the plane dives .
a result of poor design if you ask me .
on the contrary , the screeching was intrinsic
it made the blood run cold in everyone 's veins .
excited about the science trip ?
yeah , and peter 's plan .
i don 't .. i don 't have a plan .
like a .. like a grandmother ?
he 's collecting tiny spoons .
that was a real roller coaster .
smart ...
dude , i think that went really great .
the wife thought that i was a mistress .
it was .. it was really a mess .
and , of course , thanks to our very own
and thank you , you guys , for having me .
he 'll be right back out to take photos and videos .
that was so cool . i was so nervous .
no , i thought you did great .
uh , yeah , i felt that too . i felt that too .
because , if you don 't talk to him ,
cause , i 'm scared . just answer the phone .
yeah .
did you heart that ? they 're calling me .
i 'm gonna call him . i promise you , i 'm gonna call him . i will .
i promise you , i 'll call him .
yeah , hi .
okay , one question at a time .
are you the head avenger now ?
if aliens come back , what are you gonna do ?
sean winford , queens tribune .
those are big shoes to fill .
i 'm looking for a , uh
it 's the most perfect word in the world .
what does it mean ?
i can mean .. i don 't know . get out of my face .
it 's the best thing italy created , except for maybe espresso .
german ? american .
" boh " is my new superpower .
i mean , that completely changes
how does that even work with all the quantum .... ?
s-sorry . it 's really cool .
anyway ...
creatures formed from the primary elements :
turns out , the myths are real .
thor was a myth , and now i study him in my physics class .
they first materialized on my earth many years ago .
i was part of the last battalion left trying to stop them .
our satellites confirm it .
there 's only one left : fire .
the one that destroyed my earth .
i 'm sorry .
we have one mission : kill it .
i 'm sorry , did you say prague ?
you cannot show her that photo , dude . come on .
she deserves the truth .
it 's been 10 minutes . let 's go !
i don 't see any mountain goats .
i know you think none of us have noticed , peter ..
.... but your new look , i love it .
this place is so classy .
speak for yourself .
what can i say ?
everyone get settled in , rest up because tonight , big surprise ,
the fact that you disappear out of nowhere for no reason .
i had my .. the tummy ?
what ? no . of course i 'm not a male escort .
why are you on this school trip ?
okay . okay . i can 't believe i figured it out !
this is for my family !
sorry .
yep . stand by .
pause . i 'm not in love with this choreography ,
de-cloak drones .
start the show .
i don 't like this . something 's definitely up .
ned , that doesn 't look good .
and the kids are in the kill zone .
i wasted my life playing video games ,
i post stupid videos daily for people to like me .
spider-man ... ? spider-man follows me ?
if you saved us , then why are we about to die ?
i kept my identity pretty guarded this past couple years .
and i 'm tired of the lies .
are you dating ?
not really .
bill while you go moose hunting for seven years ?
right , because then it 's murder .
you shut up .
we have to get rid of the car .
the police might find it , and there could be dna .
if the police don 't find it. we 'll get the insurance
that sounds good .
it pisses me off . i 've got four kids , you know ?
l out of every 4 traffic accidents happens on residential streets .
don 't you think that 's a little bit extreme ?
i don 't think it 's extreme .
you have a ton of messages from work . tanaka called , said it was urgent .
i need to be here if she wakes up .
you have to take care of yourself .
you 're my best friend .
it 's no secret that you 've been having financial problems .
that 's it .
i want you out .
oh , yes , i do .
i want you gone by the time i get back .
i will leave today .
my sleep cycle is totally out of whack .
yeah , that 's right . you heard me .
i 'm not licensed to write prescriptions .
this will put you right to sleep .
wall to wall rotten wood .
so julie said that you came by before ?
tomorrow for this wine tasting , and , uh ..
a few stacks of cash ? come on .
i mean , he could be a hit man for the mob .
i never get out of the house .
well , we just wanted you to know how much we care .
not really .
well , more importantly , is there any good news about juanita ?
all we can do is wait and hope for the best .
lassie would have had a fire truck here by now ,
run , bongo , run ! go get help !
i know the last few days have been stressful , and , uh ...
i know , i know . you and dad are here for me .
surely that arouses some kind of emotion .
now , if you 'll excuse me ...
why do you care ?
you want to know how i feel ?
okay , here goes .
yeah , in my book , that 's pretty much a deal breaker .
now , i started snooping around
is that what you think ?
you know , there 's this whole part of your life that you keep completely walled off .
i 'm a good guy ,
well , every little detail is one thing .
i don 't want to be with somebody who doesn 't trust me .
maybe we shouldn 't .
yeah .
lynette , you know , when are you coming back ?
there 's lynette 's car . she 's got to be close .
what do you think 's happening with lynette ?
something 's very , very wrong .
well , aren 't you just a ball of fun .
not only that .
so what happens if i repent later ,
well , let 's say i don 't die .
um , i will let you do your thing .
you know , we 're all responsible for the choices we make .
what i want is to be happy .
i know .
i love my kids so much .
lynette , you are a great mother .
i can 't do it .
it 's so humiliating .
thanks .
i was just
sorry .
okay , i know , and i was .
you know , for maximum feng shui .
it is my kid 's birthday ,
shane left the door open . maybe he got out .
we are ordering pizza .
hello ? pizza .
what ?
where 's the rest of him ?
l ... i don 't know !
shit , shit !
this is all our fault .
you are just too sweet for your own good , andy .
i learned my cooking from you , you know ?
oh , god .
andy made this for me .
yeah , i know . it 's heavy .
tell me , when 's the last time you made me anything ?
okay .
look , um ... i know that people have probably been talking to you about me ,
you know what i mean ?
you know , thinking they need to fit in ,
gotta be careful who you hanging around in a place like this .
even the hearing impaired don 't wanna listen to me .
i named him chode .
salute your master .
yum yum .
including a fuzzy new friend , the buddi bear .
oh , my god .
i 'm henry kaslan .
buddi 's only goal is making your child happy .
greg , honey , go help your brother .
i 'm peeing !
okay , so , i have one more week of school , then it 's summer vacation .
just because the weather 's nice ,
unfortunately , my dad 's idea of a perfect
but as long as i stay one step ahead of him ..
last day of school !
that 's okay , but ...
those guys are setting a bad example .
will be to stay one move ahead .
our boys probably won 't even get up till noon .
what are you doing up ?
did you think i 'd just lie around all day ?
manny was given tingy right after he was born .
but now , it 's a couple of pieces of yarn
i 'm sure it 'll turn up .
look at this garbage .
the comic li 'l cutie .
you 're my bff ... best father forever !
i know .
general lee isn 't going to paint himself .
you can 't take away everything they love and disappear downstairs .
find an activity you both enjoy .
num , num , num , num !
i need to go to the bathroom .
your call cannot be completed as dialed .
what a piece of junk !
uh ..
do you have anything to tell us , greg ?
anything about , " these people are driving me crazy " ?
how can you stand to be near me when i lied ?
i 'm a liar .
the sacred bond of our friendship is broken .
and i didn 't mean to get you in trouble with the cranium shaker .
it was actually pretty fun . now we can say we 've really lived .
rise and shine , buddy !
now holly knows i 'm not a member ,
thanks , dad .
hey .
the thing is , i 'm using ..
this bill is five times the normal amount .
there he is now .
of course . that 's roland gropper .
hey , rowley !
he called you a wounded gazelle .
he 's a disgrace to every wilderness explorer ...
hey , what is that ?
yeah , it 's been a few weeks ,
the expectations are too high .
you don 't know that .
i mean , i shine . i 'm amazing .
you said you wanted to work and not talk ,
i 'm okay to talk about this stuff .
hello .
this guy 's on something , okay ? listen , just relax !
he came swinging at me .
he was trying to hold up a taxi .
augustin ? augustin .
what is it ? what 's going on ?
what ?
he 's haitian . it 's not unusual for haitians
right , what do you have next ?
double shift today ?
miss taylor .
oh , they said i might have a concussion ,
i have a couple of questions for you .
i just had no idea this was still going on .
she was afraid to tell you . she was afraid to tell me .
it affects the neurotransmitter in the brain called serotonin .
basically , it helps stop the brain from telling you you 're sad .
no , of course . of course .
i was taking classes when i met martin .
i was working at this , uh , bar downtown to help pay for school ,
things that i had no idea how to make .
and he ended up staying until we closed . then he asked me out .
i didn 't know who he was or what he did . he was just
and that made me really nervous .
he had this beautiful sailboat , and he took me out on it .
he swept me off my feet .
how old were you ?
time goes bv so fast .
you said you felt depressed before .
yeah . in greenwich , connecticut . victoria siebert .
do you mind if i contact dr. siebert about your history ?
for a little over nine months .
her entire life , gone .
i 'm glad she 's seeing a man this time . i think that will help .
never felt seen by her father .
i 'd be happy to see her have a different kind of experience .
oh , ves . wellbutrin . prozac . effexor .
i remember she had problems with sleep and nausea . chills
i have a patient with some similar issues .
welcome , everyone ! thank you for coming .
you know , i may have some samples here . let me see .
she , uh , hasn 't mentioned that .
has he been released yet ?
well , maybe that will help turn things around .
i 'm sorry .
it 's okay , it 's okay .
aron cloron
oh , the advantages of having a husband who can write prescriptions .
it 's a beta blocker . hmm .
everyone takes them .
people going to interviews for big jobs .
it just makes it easier for you to be who you are .
a woman from merrill and a guy from citicorp .
sorry , d. i 've got to return this . it 's an emergency .
dr. banks , i really need to talk to you .
yeah . i just got your message .
i went to your office , but you weren 't there . so i came here .
if it 's an emergency . i can admit you .
i was getting on the subway and ..
i have to go to work . i just need five minutes .
okay , five minutes . okay .
i gave a talk for five minutes and played 36 holes .
two billion ?
do we have to talk about this ? you 're ruining mv lunch .
got my son an autographed ball ! hmm .
where was i for all this ?
what do you have to do ?
so you 'll be even busier .
but the flip side is
mom ?
i was having a bad dream .
yes , i am . so , he 's gonna help you .
do i have to dream when i sleep ?
they don 't all have to be bad .
yeah .
the prints on the knife are hers .
she doesn 't have one . just kept talking about you .
she made the 911 call herself .
when was the last time you saw her ?
and what was she like ?
she doesn 't remember anything about a guest . kids ?
she was taking these .
she ever talk to you about something like this ?
you can talk to her at rikers .
what ?
it 's a side effect of this medication .
she kills people in her sleep , too .
she ever tell you anything to
the future ?
see , either she 's a murderer or
either way , someone gets punished .
i 'd like to see you consulting with us on this one .
is it ?
they want me to take something else .
is there any way that
that 's not what the police are saying .
i don 't know what else i could have done . she wanted to stay on it .
we see them for an hour a day , maybe a couple of times a week .
with what ?
they can 't do that .
he killed his wife , threw her in the pool ,
didn 't even know she was dead until they charged him with the crime .
he was acquitted last year .
i have to tell you , i have been approached by the state
i am in a rather difficult spot here . i hope you appreciate that .
it just makes the whole system look bad .
no . if she had , i would have reported it .
martin 's mother . she 's the one who hired me .
you want to talk about it ?
for something bad ?
did the person do it ?
you have no comment about any of this ?
do you have any comment at all about this ?
what 's your relationship ?
i think they had cameras .
there 's a back stairway
i 'm worried she 's going to see something .
i think i saw her in the elevator . she seemed totally normal .
what was she taking ? it 's not what i 'm taking , is it ?
you 'd ... you 'd tell me , right ?
current and past patients .
she described her suicide attempt as a mistake .
her husband wanted her home as well .
driving a car into a wall isn 't violent ?
and consulted with her previous doctor as well .
i 've spoken to her .
sometimes nights .
that 's a pretty large workload .
and we have a boy , my stepson , in private school .
so , longer hours , higher volume of patients , more stress .
of course .
no , that 's not going to happen .
i 'm just an expert witness .
she worried me .
what differentiates us from , let 's say , insects ,
if , for example , i 'm hungry , lam consciously aware of that .
so you intend to make a sandwich .
so , what you are saying is that to have intent ,
the question calls for a legal conclusion , not a medical one .
we should get dr. siebert .
dr. siebert 's records have already been submitted to the d.a .
but if i 'm just a victim of circumstance and biology ..
we 'll apply for your release .
then we keep going .
we can 't argue that you didn 't do any of that , so ,
or maybe it goes the other way .
i will tell you what i know .
she has come up in a number of my sessions as well .
i have clients who are afraid to take their medications .
look , i spoke with her lawyer and the d.a. we worked it out
it 's all gonna go away .
it 's going to follow you around forever .
what does that mean ? if she 's not guilty , why am i ?
you can see what i 'm saying ?
never .
their daughter committed suicide
it 's not unusual for there to be emotional transference between
never ! it was a fantasy !
it can steal away your time .
i had a patient who was having an affair .
cried , repented . didn 't stop .
he 's finally got a handle on his issues , like some great epiphany .
he 'd been lying to her .
the kids blamed me . the wife blamed me . even the patient blamed me .
the point is the cardiologist can see it coming , the heart attack .
but who can see the lies ?
you didn 't tell me you wrote the article .
it would have been a little self-involved
why didn 't you tell me about the sleepwalking ?
no , faster than that . oh , faster than that .
she was wearing the seat belt ? are you sure ?
one moment , you 're living high on the hog , and the next moment ,
and then what happened ...
i 've suffered from my own depression , so i understand .
" every afternoon , around 3 : 00 , like a poisonous fog bank rolling in
darkness visible . darkness visible .
i 'm keeping an eye on her .
no one knows why . it 's a complete mystery .
and it isn 't illegal .
jon , i know what insider trading is . i used to work in finance .
hey . see what happened at sadler-benelux
azilvle , on the other hand ... up . wav up .
i didn 't hear . my phone was off ' cause i was at the hospital .
no , the delatrex thing is over . it 's gone .
what ?
i 'm not letting another alison finn happen ,
but this is starting to make sense now !
it doesn 't make sense that you 're sitting here doing this all day long !
you 're the only one that 's still here .
a woman you were treating killed her husband .
but i already told the truth
i wanted to give him a daughter .
were you angry with him ? did you hate him ?
the wav he smelled .
did you do it for the money ?
another thing . sadler-benelux is down . stop talking , dr. banks .
no ! you could have worked with us : i asked .
you see , we can 't just start over .
it proves we got beat .
now , i don 't know how you feel about that ,
just come out there
i actually can prove it .
i hope you learned something .
quite a lot , actually .
and she 'll need more medication as well .
i 'd like an envelope delivered to manhattan .
there is . i think you 'll agree .
mavbe we can meet for a coffee ? thanks .
check erased messages . press 1-9 .
you should know how difficult it is
spend the fucking money now .
what are you talking about ?
only she asked me to keep you from seeing her .
it 's actually been shown to be remarkably effective
no idea what it might do to a normal person .
a personality inventory . just a series of true-or-false questions .
this is dr. siebert .
not a very subtle tool ,
they like hard data to look at .
who ?
miss taylor , you need to step back .
miss tavlor , you need to relax .
i shouldn 't even be here ! i 'm not sick ! get me dr. siebert ! no ! no !
no , i don 't want it ! i don 't want it !
dr. banks .
yes .
maybe i am a genius .
talk about what ?
and what is she going to say ?
she could tell a long sordid story about her former shrink .
probably around the same time that boys are learning to lie .
how much i loved my husband .
when did you decide to kill him ?
you make it over and over again ,
each and every fucking problem , every disappointment .
why me ?
that was just a happy coincidence .
it didn 't have to be you .
and how does this connect to you being adopted ?
and now i 'm making it happen .
excuse me , dr. siebert , i think someone wants you .
we 're gonna have to pick this up next time .
of course not .
it doesn 't matter . you 're out . it 's taken care of .
what did you do with the rest of the money ?
mine 's in dubai , yours is in grand cayman .
are you sure you didn 't tell him anything else ?
you taught me to be such a sad , sad girl .
do you remember the first time ?
do you remember how wet i made you ?
could you ...
when i say this is a very important patient ,
no one touches this patient but you .
you will report every result back to me personally .
i will not have another o 'malley lost under this roof .
meredith grey .
it 's been so long .
this is so freaking cool .
how 's that coming , by the way ?
we should check that gallbladder .
any pain , uh , vomiting ?
mrs. o 'malley , those aren 't good things .
it 's just that ... look at you .
thank you .
i kept hearing georgie 's voice saying ,
we 're gonna take very good care of you .
you 're all grown up .
we 're contacting them now to arrange pick-up ,
i 'm a writer .
and i 've managed to make a lot of other people
but kate and nathan and alexander ,
i 'm just trying to help you .
yeah .
it 's such a treat , seeing you again , meredith .
catch me up .
oh , that 's wonderful . any kids ?
maybe i just need to back off .
mark is afraid that avery is gonna break up with him .
i 'd prefer that .
i thought i taught you a lot of things .
i 'm going to court tomorrow ...
i want my kid back so badly .
i want to dress the part , so i 'm thinking my navy dress .
my charcoal pants have a hole in the ass .
i 'm useless ...
but i know how to do an e.r.c.p. ,
really ? how did it happen for you ?
ha ha .
i mean , how is my decision to go to med school
let 's hurry up and wash this off .
i can 't eat the stuff that 's on my butt !
oh , wow !
what 's going on ?
yeah .
solaad ...
but i 'm heading back without having done anything .
if meliodas were here , i 'm sure that 's what he 'd say .
i journeyed on my own in search of the seven deadly sins .
the journey was a reckless one .
we 're close to our destination .
here and now ,
geez , what are you doing ?
what 's going on ? that huge egg just broke !
that 's .
the seal has been broken !
but why ?
all of you , have no fear !
are you serious ? this wasn 't part of the deal !
this is the day we have trained for .
i will begin preparations for the resurrection ceremony .
time for the festivities to begin !
oh , how lovely ! there 's one with some potential .
i am gara of the six knights of black .
why don 't you play with them ?
you 're just an appetizer before the feast !
o great beast who has been sealed alongside us ,
we won 't let solaad 's friends get hurt !
let 's see .. which one will make an interesting opponent ?
hawk ! you 're okay !
glad you made it back .
what is that ?
see , aren 't you starting to feel good ?
then you can give me a hug in her stead !
h-how did you ..
why don 't you just shut up , sea urchin dude ?
for a brat like you to know my name ,
it 's said you 're as strong as the ten commandments .
am i right ?
i don 't know who you are , but you must want to die badly .
the one who didn 't choose me to be in the ten commandments ..
i will never forgive him !
is this the one collecting our souls ?
my body ..
any filth that approaches the ceremony
who 'll give me leftovers if you die !
crap ! don 't let a guy like that beat you .
the captain won 't die so easy .
do not fret .
do something , granny !
as soon as zoria 's wounds are healed , we 'll bring him here .
master zoria !
solaad !
i 'm sorry i returned late .
they live in the demon realm ,
if we are talking only about power ,
this is what solaad was talking about .
what are you guys ..
this sinister power and the mark on his forehead ..
is he really from the demon clan ?
the winged sword is a sacred blade bestowed upon us by the gireat oshiro ,
as head warrior , i cannot thank him enough .
what ?
that is our law .
we must obey the law . we can never pull out that sword .
why won 't you , granny ?
those who can fight will head there immediately !
they won 't be able to stop that monster .
i 'm going too ! i don 't want any more people to get hurt !
let 's go , gowther .
masteli princess , i leave the captain to you .
there 's no way we can win .
the seven deadly sins !
you guys are just irritating .
everyone , run !
even the perfect cube could take only one hit .
we 'll have to hold it off .
guardian !
you 've got some grit . i applaud you .
as thanks for what you did to our captain ,
why have you returned ?
that 's wrong , father !
you threw aside your pride as a celestial and ran !
but we haven 't been fighting just to follow the laws !
it will most likely hold for three minutes .
so , you 're solaad .
you look good !
sure . i expect plenty of rewards .
merida , a princess does not place her weapons on the table .
a princess should not have weapons in my opinion .
princess or not , learning to fight is essential .
i climbed the crone 's tooth ,
they say only the ancient kings were brave enough to drink the fire .
nothing , mum .
but we can 't just run away from who we are .
i want my freedom !
i 'm not doing any of this to hurt you .
but it 's my life , it 's ...
i think you 'd see , if you could just ..
this is one of a kind !
your broom !
wood cannot be imbued with magical properties .
of wood .
tough as stone .
i didn 't know where you 'd gone or when you 'd come back .
angus threw me . but i 'm not hurt .
honestly ?
my head 's spinning like a top .
suddenly i 'm not so well .
merida ! just take me to my room .
a little to the left . that 's good . a wee bit to the left . that 's good .
now , clear out of there , boys . i don 't want you to spoil my shot .
my lady queen .
doesn 't make sense . it cannot open doors .
let 's just get inside .
dingwall was the last up .
what did you see , maudie ? just spit it out , maudie .
maudie , honey , come here ! it 's all right !
they 'll be fine . won 't you , boys ?
now , i 'll be back soon .
right !
one more time .
that 's it . ta-ta .
no . no ! where 'd you go ?
what ?
maybe there 's a book of spells . look around . we 'll need more vials .
thank you for visiting . have a lovely day .
no more talk
you decide which one of our sons your daughter will marry .
then our alliance is over ! this means war !
you 've got to stop them before it 's too late .
but how do we get you through there and up to the tapestry
that 's right . let 's see her .
well , i ...
what is this ?
we 've all heard that tale . lost kingdom .
i know now how one selfish act can turn the fate of a kingdom .
legends are lessons .
our kingdom is young .
but in them , our bond was struck .
but when invaders threatened us from the sea ,
you risked everything for each other .
the story of this kingdom is a powerful one .
it was an alliance forged in bravery and friendship
i tore a great rift in our kingdom .
and i know now that i need to amend my mistake
hubert , harris , help hamish .
aye , we 've got you now !
put your back into it , dingwall !
down you go , you scoundrel .
get back . that 's my mother .
i ain 't got any more slink !
we 've had it since molly was a baby .
yeah , i don 't want it anymore .
where 's woody ?
but then something really weird happened .
what a kid .
no , no . she literally made a new friend .
come on out . that 's it .
come on , let 's get you out of there .
good . good .
this toy is crucial to bonnie
i know this is new to everybody ...
when she started playing with him ..
i wish you could have seen it .
and i swear , once she made forky ...
be quiet !
maybe chili , and then the trash .
freedom !
5.32 miles , give or take .
i 'll meet you at the rv park .
i can 't find forky ! he 's missing !
i 'm sure he 's here somewhere .
no ! there 's only one forky !
maybe he fell on the ground somewhere .
we 're gonna find him , okay ?
woody was right .
why isn 't woody back yet ?
buzz , what do we do ?
come on out . there 's someone i want you to meet .
what 's the situation ? we heading out of town or ..
you remember the rag doll i told you about ?
gonna have nightmares .
all right , this isn 't so bad .
not just the dummies .
woody just sits in the closet ? with no playtime ?
that 's awful .
what are you doing ?
but it 's bonnie . she 's right .
there .
you better hope the dummies didn 't .
what did i say ? i lead . you follow .
just tell me how to help .
then stay out of my way . i 'm getting my sheep back .
giggle knows what to do .
but when rejean realized i couldn 't jump
rejean threw me away !
why , rejean ? why ?
that was a long time ago .
crash ?
sure am .
without a kid ?
you 'd be surprised .
well , i saw your lamp in the window ...
will you look at that ?
that 's gonna be quite a jump for you and duke .
didn 't i tell you ? you 're going with him .
no , no , no . woody , look ! it 's really happening !
i 'm gonna cry .
i found this old doll .
nah .
there 's my backpack !
once opened for stevie nicks .
ow ! fuck , dad !
well , th-that .
that you 're not supposed to talk like that .
yes , i am .
i don 't know . it was a rodeo .
they have clowns at your rodeo ?
that ain 't even a fuckin ' ro .. that 's a fair .
i 'm talking about lights . shit .
did my own face paint . costume .
i made them bulls run till i broke every bone
it is different . you bet your little dick it 's different .
that moth .. he 's in there .
worked like a charm , man .
so , you know , i ran with that for a while , because , uh ,
but , uh , that didn 't quite work for me , you know .
man , i thought if god was real , he-he built me with a
no , i 'm not .
get your fuckin ' ass out of here .
fuckin ' fucker .
all right , everyone find your way into the hug circle .
otis , would you please join us over here ?
this is a feeling that you can have anywhere you are .
to this pool .
to this feeling .
can you feel that ?
right ?
you can 't do this in a car on the freeway or in court .
isn 't hugging yourself like tickling yourself ?
well , my shit feel good .
percy you might be too good at this .
and i tried this in court .
what do you mean ?
i have a suggestion .
just go out there alone and do that .
let me know how it went
yeah , i got ptsd .
i thought only soldiers and black people got that shit .
i just know i 'm stuck here , and these people .
i don 't have time for this .
my cousin got eight years in prison . eight .
yeah , when i was , uh , 11 , my mother figured
specifically this woman .
she 'd beat you over the head until she broke her hand
do it again the next day
just drama , you know ?
major fucking drama .
nobody cares about the fucking heart rate .
they want to see funny faces .
they want to see funny faces , otis .
" jeff , come on , it 's been over an hour . "
hold on .
i can 't think in here !
some of us got jobs .
i don 't do this shit to you . deb
what the fuck ?
you don 't have the scene yet .
let 's just , let 's just end it .
give me a fucking cigarette .
yeah .
there you go , fauntleroy . you got a fucking cigarette . go ahead , smoke it .
i don 't give a shit . you 're paying for it .
give me one reason .
i have good instincts ?
why i could never make it in hollywood .
you could if you started when i did .
doing fucking push-ups .
give me a cigarette , dad .
i 'm doing you a favor by paving you to be my chaperone .
whoa , you 're doing who a favor ?
i 'm not stupid .
you picking up on that ?
mom says that you .
it 's naive .
you know , stone crumbles . people fucking die
i want to understand .
i know .
pull ' em out the fucking envelope . you don 't need me for stories .
how do you think it feels ...
i have so much green under my fingernails
green guys make black guys look like white guys .
tell me one good thing about it .
seen ' em ? i was conceived in one .
well , a little muss , some fuss .
that 's revolting .
better make it six , ' cause if it 's for ladies ,
not exactly my scene .
this is boyfriend stuff , meaning he 's gross like you .
here , we gotta lay down a layer of grease
come on , start layering .
wanna hear it ?
and broken the guinness world record for most guinnesses .
is that a new mcdonald 's or the same one ?
come on ! make ' em move ! hit the horn again !
okay , big shot .
look , i know i said i 'd spring for a cab , but it 's $ 70 !
don 't worry , han , we 'll chip in .
that 's all we made today .
this is our funeral money , max .
not much more , but a little bit .
they 're playing closing time .
now i 'm never gonna sell the pee funnels .
heads up , peoples !
or two for 25 ! five for 60 !
you can 't sell those out the window .
just drive , grandma .
you say that again , and i 'll cut your tongue out !
why do you want to punish all the women in the tri-state area ?
earl , what 're you doing here ?
so it 's $ 10 .
that 's ' cause there 's nothing below the waist .
i mean , i guess .
are you over here making money off of me ,
it 's a st. paddy 's tradition ,
we 've been in this line so long , now i actually have to pee .
she didn 't have 10 bucks to tickle han ,
uh , sorry , back of the line . no cuts .
sorry , no cuts , no buts , no coconuts .
i totally understand . yeah , i get it .
she 's having fun .
oh , good .
i mean , there were no lines .
max , this is nice .
nothing . absolutely nothing .
now i 'm thinking archie 's dead .
i mean , i find his distaste
this week , will you return my call ?
i 'm working on a lot of fascinating projects .
i don 't think the world is waiting for another fanny brice biography , lee .
good night .
so that the guests can have a full roll .
i lost my ticket , but that 's my coat over there .
have a good night , ma 'am .
we 'll talk about it in a few years .
there are lots of things to consider . after all , they are first cousins .
yes , and look at us .
come on . it 's your favorite .
yeah , i 'm aware of that .
i 'm sorry , but the doctor told me that
you owe us $ 82 .
you know , if she did come out here , she 'd see this .
i 'm sorry , but i can 't .
god.asshole .
i 'll give you two dollars .
i don 't even need that much .
i got a sick cat , and i ..
there 's people waiting .
you 've been here longer than i have ,
i will . absolutely . thank you .
i have an untenable fly situation .
hey , jack handsome .
i don 't know . can you ?
it 's jack hock .
we were both pleasantly pissed at some horrible book party .
it 's slowly flooding back to me .
steinberg !
she 's not an agent anymore . she died .
she did say that .
i believe i can sell this .
i could give more for better content .
true .
oh . let me see if i have enough .
i 'll be the first to buy it .
are you kidding me ?
" do i have to leave him an extra something for repairs ? "
how does $ 350 sound ?
the infection will probably go away in a day or two ,
and here , your mom needed some milk .
you 're welcome . your hair looks nice today .
are you still having insect problems ?
i 'm going to take care of it .
my dear billy ...
ever yours , no ? i .
good afternoon .
is that also for typed , signed letters ?
what can i do for you ?
these are wonderful . yes , i 'd be very interested .
he 's asked me to help sell some of his treasures
oh , my !
some things are just better kept to oneself ,
can you keep a secret ?
quite by accident , i find myself in a rather ... criminal position .
i suppose not . but how thrilling to be forging pieces of paper that go where ?
no , i am selling to collectors .
i don 't know why i told you .
i should have gone out there and gotten a rock and told the rock ,
you 're not the only one without friends .
we broke up . she was a pain in my ass .
because she wanted things .
i don 't suppose you dance ?
like buying groceries or securing shelter .
i mean , life is dreary .
as i love you
no problem . i am asking $ 600 .
not all of the other dealers are as discerning as we are .
just in case , who should we look out for ?
i 'd stay away from him .
what 'd i say ?
oh , good . he 's almost finished .
finally . those flies are driving me crazy .
i 'll come back when it 's cleaned up .
no , i robbed a bank .
how you doing , mrs. ungur ?
those were good cookies , weren 't they ?
you 're lee ?
alan .
very witty , don 't you think ?
i think what she had was a very big personality .
you sure these are the real thing ?
nah , most people will believe anything you tell them anyway .
personally , i don 't get it .
she 's 12 .
this is paul from armada books .
i have a couple of questions regarding the last coward letter i purchased .
it 's important .
hi , lee .
you know i 've got that client who knew no ? coward .
mr. coward would never have been as explicit as he was
anyway , apparently , the letter is a fake .
i mean , my uncle would be appalled .
yes .
they asked me to wear a wire .
and if they want me to be a witness .
but you 're gonna pay me $ 5,000 .
well , come on , i 'm not gonna rat you out or anything .
i don 't have $ 5,000 .
figure it out .
oh , thank you very much .
no , it 's all right .
" edna ferber . "
she wrote that movie with james dean .

oh , golly , however did he humiliate you ?
do i say " stop what ? " or just throw in the towel ?
oh , excuse me , that is my mother you 're talking about ,

how could you think that i would spend the night
you 're kind of a sucker .
until we get married a third time ,
mary may visit me in new york .
maybe we meet halfway .
i can 't be the only one that knows that 's halfway .
mary , i 'm sorry you 're in the middle of this .
i genuinely like your father .
and according to beverly , his sexual prowess is subpar .
are you saying that my dad 's not good enough for your mom ?
pretty efficient , huh ?
but why should you get to go
well , i don 't want to stay here with her . i 'll go .
yeah , that 's the smile i 'm gonna remember
mommy , you want to take this one ?
and court appearances .
i 'm looking forward to meeting his father .

hi , mr. peabody .
i was just getting to that .
to prepare him fon all the wonders of the world , present and past .
who dares to insult me with this melon ?
mr. feabody , how did you escape ?
i noticed the distance between the sewer lids ... .
let that little keepsake be a reminder to you .
that no matter what challenges you face mno matter how far away i might seem .
that no matter what challenges you face ano matter how far away i might seem .
good job .

looks like someone really knows their history , huh , penny ?
maybe you can come over to my house sometime .
you 've only got one , huh ?
good one !
what do you got there , sherman ?
sherman has never done anything like this before .
well , the girl was being a bit of a bully ...
it 's normal for children to tease .
clearly , it 's because of how he 's being raised .
i must point out , ms. grunion
this kind of wanton violence is totally unacceptable .
she called me a dog .
thank you for telling me .
i love you , mr. feabody .
lose your eyes
a captain of industry .
because , your honor ..
and now . i want to give him the one thing i always wanted .
of raising a human boy ?

jlit 'snotrny birthday . no , it isn 't .
it 's not your birthday . right again .
nope . it 's not father 's day .
we 're so delighted you could make it on such short notice .
yeah , we 're interested in what 's going on , that 's for sure .
hi , penny .
now , why don 't you go show penny your mineral collection , sherman ?
come on .
now , the kids can resolve their differences before ms. grunion arrives .
if it weren 't for patty , i would have pressed charges already .
where my daughter is concerned , nothing is more important than ..
why ?
and not come to this lame dinner party .
to travel to a time when you existed .
oh , yeah .
wow .
are you kidding ? where should we go first ?
let 's go !
a beacon of progress on the horizon of humanity ...
i just hope penny isn 't suffering too badly .
what 's the matter , my sweet little desert blossom ?
as a matter of fact , they are .
ibows barbarians .
would you like me to have them skinned , covered with honey ...
you would do that for me ?
what ? you can 't marry this guy !
only in this manner may the plagues upon this land be avoided
take this girl to the gates !
well , i have been feeling a little under the weather ...
where do we go next , mr. peabody ?
we 've got to get back to the dinner party ...
we don 't have to mention the whole
anyway , as far as i 'm concerned , they get married too young in ancient egypt .
warning .
charge now . warning .
all this zipping about the cosmos has drained our power supply .
sluck would have it ..
i can 't even tell my left brain from my right anymore !
mona lisa ?
until you smile !
the sunshine , the pasta .
but i have not seen any of them , leonardo !
nothing is as beautiful as an elegant equation ...
why can 't children be so simple ?
believe me , i tried to build one .
here , sherman ! you fly it !
sure you do . it 'll be fun !
i 'm letting go . one ...
two ...
well , it 's certainly not my fault !
if you 're such a great parent ...
is someone gonna take me away from you ?
you just need to trust me .
what 's happening ?
of course i didn 't die .
hey . how did you get back ?
i hit upon a combination of bones , stone and yak fat ..
i 'm in love !
hey , einstein , it 's a red light .
cake !
i 'm trying to find another wormhole ...
time travel failed .
penny , my queen , i know you 're in there .
come out , peabody , with your paws in the air .
and a multiplicity of major traffic violations .
if you arrest me , i won 't be able to fix
sherman , that 's it ! are you thinking what i 'm thinking ?
it 's exactly what you all just said ...
we 'll create our own gravitational field
oh , my
how do you know ?
how do you know your source is telling the truth ?
so this source , what does he need you for ?
he 's part of the intelligence community .
and he needs you to help him .
i can help you .
but i didn 't , did i ?
my family weren 't supposed to be on that flight .
but i didn 't .
because i didn 't want to .
all right .
your breathing as the bass .
your heart as the drums .
put another one in . never less than two .
you hit someone in the sternum with that ,
shoot me .
right here .
shut up . just do it .
your breathing as the bass .
it 's about time this hospital got some good publicity for a change .
this is the day . dr. bailey
i 'd rather wait to celebrate till we pull this thing off
yeah , yeah , very impressive
i mean , the man does not have one damn pore .
no , i need to talk
no no , no .
i couldn 't go down there .
i left this morning before she got up
girl on girl . it 's hot .
one girl talking about how much it sucked ?
it is not about whose services you wish to be on
um , why would they need so many doctors for one surgery ?
because it 's not just one surgery .
uh , bailey snagged all the surgical residents and interns ,
i was thinking , if you weren 't on call tonight that , maybe we could
well , i had a lot of fun last night .
anyway just let me know .
oh , me ! i-i 'll go if you need a volunteer
and , megan ,
it 's really no big deal
i totally understand .
my face is starting to hurt from smiling .
it comes faster when i push it .
paying his son for a kidney what exactly would happen ?
like someone stole an organ herself
then they would drop out , then they would drop out ,
it 's just a gift
oh , i 'm not such a saint .
honey , would you mind
i have
fix this .
i have been poked and prodded like a lab rat ,
well , you re about 20 years too late .
cause if not , i ' m outta here . i have a life to get back to
but you did do it . i don 't understand .
i can 't believe it
oh. your son .
it took me months to find him .
right .
his mom died .
i made a lot of mistakes .
some people are just broken .
then you can 't be disappointed .
i 'm sorry
you 're only as old as you feel .
speaking of nothing ...
i 'm closing the diner early in honor of your birthday .
absolutely , han .
caroline , sweetheart , if i was you ,
i have two announcements , both good news .
well , you 've already popped everything else .
they say diamonds are a girl 's best friend .
i thought a girl 's best friend
i had my cousin svela swallow it to bring it to america .
prison arts and crafts has gotten pretty fancy .
this one was ordered in 2011 .
correction : when he had everyone else 's money .
well , here you go .
i 'm gonna walk home .
we got a car !
can 't we have anything ?
it goes from 0 to 100 in 2.9 seconds .
back off , tokyo drift .
and by that , i mean get away from it .
that 's why i drive my toyota yaris .
wait a minute . is it ted turner ?
it 's caroline 's .
well , everyone away from the car .
the car is being seized in the morning .
it 's just like my eighth birthday
the paramedics gave him 50 / 50 when they got here .
hey , i need you guys to get him down to the trauma center , all right
that 's it . have a nice trip .
over 20 million was stolen from central city bank
5 : 01 the third subject , donovan macdonald , remains in a coma ,
released updated information regarding the alleged suspects .
all right .
mm-hmm .
it 's fairly catastrophic retrograde amnesia .
i believe it was real .
every neurological test we 've ever done said it was real .
it took him six months to learn how to walk again
it 's all right . just breathe through it .
everything 's gonna be all right .
you used to live here .
it 's working .
i 'll meet you at the truck .
come on .
what is this place ?
you were talking this whole time , mac .
every cop in the state is looking for us .
it has to have some order to it .
i don 't trust this guy .
it was someone else .
maybe someone that worked here ?
i don 't know where the money is !
can 't you give me something for the pain ?
it was by the water .
it was by a river , and there was ..
there were cement towers by a river .
give me the keys . grab him now . let 's go .
come on . i got him . i got him .
grab him , grab him !
keep him out of sight !
keep him quiet and out of sight , hear me ?
sorry , who ?
he was my student at the war college .
yes . i am a lawyer .
do you agree , picquart ?
be disclosed , but the evidence against him was not lacking .
i forgot !
you have a lot of files .
here 's the telephone and here 's my office .
this was his office .
" i send you some interesting information .
a note on the cover troops .
the artillery field manual , firing . march 1894 . "
where are the documents mentioned ?
who 's the spy ?
he 's an artillery officer .
the only ones to have done this are your students at the war college .
" what a horrible nightmare i 've been living for almost two years , my dear lucie .
the days go by without me talking to anyone .
if it were just for me , i would have already slipped into the grave .
lately they 've been grilling me every night . i don 't know why .
it 's a form of hatred .
sorry , i couldn 't sleep .
quite a while .
it doesn 't matter . i can 't hope for fidelity .
if you don 't say anything , no one will ever know .
should i take this secret to the grave ?
that is the essence of our profession .
don 't bring up dreyfus . that 's an order .
colonel , i 'm leaving .
i will lock the doors .
that 's right .
find him , henry . if i knew the name , i would tell you . "
so if i asked the marquis if he said those things ,
stop it , this file is fake .
i should have done it more often .
where 's the dreyfus file ?
be nice , give it to me .
you 're right , it 's an outrageous violation of state secrets .
we have an anonymous letter .
i 'm dismayed , but ... someone 's trying to sabotage my investigation .
control yourselves .
are you obsessed with the idea to replace dreyfus with esterhazy ?
this is a bad situation , picquart . you disappoint me .
i have a lead on esterhazy .
if it was assured , i 'd accept it . but there is no such proof .
you see those two ? they 're plainclothes cops .
they worked for me .
so they sent me on an inspection at the somme , then nice .
i didn 't even have time to stop at my house .
you could have told us .
last week they wanted to send me to tripoli . a suicide mission .
so i realized i had to come back to paris at any cost .
of course .
it 's hard for me , you know .
this was confirmed by the first expert appointed by the government .
of course .
they said to keep the two cases separate .
you have stated that you believe
you may be a damn good cyborg ..
didn 't go to plan , bri .
the beginning of a new world is here .
olympus ?
i don 't know . maybe .
deunan , we fought in a world war and at the end of it all , who won ?
no one , that 's who . it is pointless .
we clear our debt to two horns . come on .
jet me take care of that .
you worry like an old woman . i was a medic during the war .
a doctor .
to your health .
i 've charged that battery as much as i can .
but we are short on parts . i 'm sorry . what else ?
because they 're probably all related .
yeah , yeah , rub it in .
here . this might hurt a little .
my job has its perks .
you know , i 've been trying to fix that thing
you should be the happiest man or thing ,
you 're never gonna be happy . never happy .
you should work better now
get-well present .
yeah , the pin 's in it .
i didn 't mean anything .
he just seems ... i don 't know , creepy .
just a little commemoration of your last job .
so how do you feel ?
good . that 's nice of you .
now they just go after anyone .
the whole thing caused your cooling system to eat up all your power .
how is it ? show her .
cee ? gentle .
looks , ike we found some trouble , bri .
gr anything else we can find .
too young for this . innocent .
i 'm not sure how innocent she really is .
they believe it 's an important one , don 't they ?
whac ?
don 't need a charge ?
feel like some company ?
silent treatment , huh ?
you know , we really did save your ass back there .
nobody 's here anymore .
did you find out where they 're from ?
come on . where ?
he 's still willing to fight for a good cause .
i don 't know .
i think so .
so tell me . are you from olympus ?
maybe not .
we 're on our way there . after we finish the mission .
i knew it .
i don 't know
emergency .
i think they 're both very capable .
holy shit !
get the fast little honey out of the way now .
if something happens to me , tell them your mission .
i know .
of course i am . i hear i 'm an optimist .
this way .
walt . is that the girl ?
bri was right .
hey .
you did good , iris . thanks , you too .
i 'm okay .
i 'm glad you think so .
we 'll go get the car .
take her west .
people never get what they want .
that city is an idea that will never work .
mus ' ve been when he found out about it
i think we can do it if we hit first .
i could only confirm 14 . that 's 15 with the pilot .
she 's not the one who 's gonna get hurt .
it 's a prototype , you see ?
of course it will . if not
it speaks .
no . didn 't olson tell you about me ?
but to try and disarm the world ?
then i threw him out of a plane .
deunan .
that makes two of us .
annd briareos ?
what 's happening ? deunan ?
we gotta get out , now .
this machine will regenerate its shields unless i stay and keep them down .
what 's the status ? i 'm losing my window .
we 'll find another way . please .
go with happiness .
i 'm trying to blend in ,
look a rainbow . it 's pretty .
thank you . go with happiness .
did you try to cut it all short and weird .
or what ?
wait what do you mean by official fugitives ?
look , johanna , we need a little more time .
and then what : attack brudite ?
we just need a few more days .
one , what ?
see , to be amity is to forgive others , and yourself .
i know what it 's like to stand
i know you 're angry , but you 're letting it consume you .
stay here and keep quite .
not that teanine is heading up the council the
now , johanna .
the easy way , or the hard way ? it 's up to you .
okay we 're good to go ! move it out !
you know something lady ?
eric is here . we need to move now , come on .
but we are both a threat to teanine .
and then what ?
and once you 've done that ?
you see , that 's the part she always conveniently leaves out .
im not going with you guys .
to candor . i 'm not going with you guys .
what 's your plan ?
i admit , i hold that belie
in my opinion a candor trial
no . as part of candors initiation , you administer a truth serum .
we dont technically discuss such matters with other factions .
but it 's not exactly honest either .
we need to find that very special one .
probably out doing crazy boyfriend thing .
up here everyting seems much smaller , you know .
sometimes i think i see lights out beyond the wall .
we can 't be the only ones left . can we ?
come on , i need your help to open this .
hey !
it 's really good to see you again .
it 's a little routine inspection ,
you think you 're safe now ? you 're wrong
it 's exactly what jeanine needs . it 's the perfect subject .
you 're responsible for the death of hundreds of people .
listen ... i found a way to live with the blood on my hands .
why dont they come out ?
heck , don 't play with it !
for helping us .
i had no idea jeanine was capable of something like this .
very soon i will be presenting what i believe to be no
she has left . she 's gone .
tobias ! people look to you for leadership .
wow !
i didn 't think you were dumb enough to actually come down here .
the killings had to stop .
man i love knowing stuff you don 't .
the only way to open that
i don 't think i was supposed to tell you that .
remarkable !
nearly defies the laws of probability .
you may find it hard to believe .
step up on the disc please .
stop the suicides or i swear i will shoot him .
she killed our parents .
what are you talking about ?
they were the ones hiding it .
seems we didnt knew our parents as well as we thought we did .

what the hell happened ?
so what you .. you could 've saved me ?
no this isn 't about you .
i did this . you had nothing to do with it .
dude .
how did you miss that ?
apparently you didn 't
and let 's not pretend
i care about my job
clarence is like that .
and that 's what makes him unique .
" lean on me " was not my choice for a single .
he was only 24 years old , was just starting
the rap star had just left the soul train awards party
and he was really , really affected by biggie 's death .
it strikes everybody at the hospital ,
since biggie was on his label ,
he 's the one to call when we 're in trouble .
from san diego , a flight was booked to go to miami .
you know , we were young , talented people ,
i 'm cured now , though , everybody .
y 'all can have me over for dinner .
and the message that i received from clarence was just to be me
you know , i was young and ...
if he 's taking his time to deliver this message to me ,
i believe what 's most important to clarence avant
it has to do with
we will take this to the next generation and keep on going .
then i think
yeah .
that 's why we 'll always have respect for clarence avant , ' cause in the ...
he 's the first family ,
that 's the example .
if i wake up tomorrow morning , and i 'm warren buffett ,
why did you lie to me ?
so , yeah , i guess that 's why .
yeah , because he 's not really sorry .
that 's actually one of the nicest things
hey . there you are .
just a few more weeks , you 'll be back full-time , huh ?
uh-oh . that wasn 't a happy " yeah . "
all right , fine . e-mail it over . i 'll take a look .
love your kids . don 't miss your job .
there 's nothing in the world
and he 's gone . okay .
oh , boy .
yeah , tell me about it .
which i know because they did .
leonard ,
is he the worst ?
does the very thought of him make your skin crawl ?
sheldon , what 's going on ?
you don 't know he 's avoiding your calls .
please leave a message , unless this is sheldon again ,
and i know that 's not a real number
what more could you have done ?
you don 't know what it was like growing up with him .
my brother adoot was especially mean .
but i am not a gullible little boy anymore .
okay . you 're right .
tell me what you need .
that 's better , thank you .
yeah , i got it , too .
i know , i have a problem .
well , i didn 't get it .
what am i supposed to do about this ?
it 's not funny .
could you just , like , not touch my computer
all right .
you are a lamb to the slaughter .
it was going well until my eye dripped in her latte .
oh , boo-hoo .
i 'm about to get married , and look at me .
oh , does it ?
sheldon , you need to apologize to your brother .
yes . like that , but nicer , and that way .
i told you this was a bad idea .
you just got to buy a new one .
never patch , buy new .
yeah . it 's officially a bro-mance .
no , because we don 't celebrate
gather round , kids ,
this custom was later appropriated
oh , penny . i know you think you 're being generous ,
you 've given me an obligation .
my first hanukkah with sheldon ,
of course i do . the essence of the custom
okay , you know what ? forget it .
no , it 's too late . i see it . that elf sticker
sheldon , i am very , very sorry .
i 'm going to need a ride to the mall .
are you gonna make it ?
all right .
no problem .
the thing just fell right over on me , didn 't it ?
it 's just a little motorcycle accident .
i don 't know . it 's all such a blur .
hi . dave . hi .
is it okay ?
lucky for the bike
oh , yeah . yeah , sure .
i 'm a physicist .
why is that so surprising ?
maybe afterwards we take the bike up the coast ,
let me just get my jacket .
yeah , if you like that type .
no , just neighbors .
yippee .
see , i will open her gift to me first
brilliant .
is it okay if i hide them in your room ?
unfortunately , i don 't .
or stay here and spend the night with the russians .
that is what i was looking for .
could you pass me that brown paper bag from my case , please ?
we 're struggling here . why don 't you take a shot at him .
first left , then immediate right .
your foot down and drive a little faster .
all we have to do is get over two 20-foot walls and a minefield
after you .
because the communist drive
i trust that miss teller was helpful .
that 's it ? that 's all you got ?
we already knew all that .
you told me , this was gonna be a simple extraction .
they were waiting for me . don 't flatter yourself . they follow everybody .
grow a spine , solo .
really ?
well , after your performance last night ... . i thought i should read up on you .
how old were you when he was sent to the gulag ?
was that when the psychotic episodes started ?
the youngest man to join , in fact , and their best within three years .
was it your mother 's reputation ?
america is teaming up with russia .
it should tell you how important this mission is . to everyone .
and at the end of this , that 's what they 'll want .
you 're the star of this show . my woman would never wear anything like that .
gaby . gaby .
give me a minute to explain . it 's your cover .
the russian minister of culture has a weakness for classical architecture
not very good at this whole subtlety thing , are you ?
aren 't you supposed to be a russian architect ?
russian agent would 've killed them both .
so you 've actually thought this through .
don 't !
so why am i playing mother , huh ?
it 's open .
with the compliments of the hotel .
thank you very much .
it 's a fine bottle of champagne . be a shame to drink it alone .
pity .
i 'm sure we can find something to do for five minutes
no . thank you .
of course .
could you please come with me , sir ? i 'm sure we can clear this up .
are you okay ?
i wonder what they do to people without invitations .
etruscan , isn 't it ? oh
what about my watch ?
no , i don 't suppose we are .
two years ago .
you never wrote your uncle rudi a word about it .
or were you , perhaps , ashamed ?
is not appreciated by most communists .
need to use the sink
nice to see you .
excuse me , i said i need to use the sink
jack deveny .
beg your pardon .
i noticed you 're very good with your hands .
e had soft bonesc
super agent here had some fun with three italian boys in the men 's room .
your new boyfriend is a nazi .
offered me a job and made advances towards me .
if you mean by " no good , " is he trying to steal me away from my fiance ?
as far as he is concerned , i am . and for the purpose of the mission , i am .
to radioactive material in last 24 hours
meet me on the gantry in five minutes .
i didn 't find anything
i thought that was my father 's watch . make mistake .
at kgb , we call it " the kiss . " it takes years to master .
and last time , i fell rather badly and hurt my head .
sleep well , napoleon .
mummy says hello .
but the tireless work of a single artist .
hello again , mr. solo .
there 's a short in the wiring . i thought i 'd located it .
once upon a time , there was a little boy .
as a particularly special little boy .
because of this boy 's apparent shortcomings .
and relentlessly by the other children .
as life continued to be a living hell .
that he didn 't see them as enemies .
i 'm actually quite pleased to see you .
i thought i found all your trackers .
do you mind ?
what about gaby ? she betrayed you . i will testify .
she fooled me too . it 's not the same .
okay . thank you .
gaby .
your instructions are to follow me , so ...
they will send an army to stop us .
the line is secured . you 're now connected , sir .
it is vital you retrieve dr. teller and the computer disk .
kill the russian , if necessary .
of this bomb at 0800 , that gives us ...
gaby 's working for you , isn 't she ?
ooooeo o
gaby has agreed to assist me . to assure i finish in time
the thing is , kuryakin , when professor teller disappeared .
nearly fouling up two years of my work .
xes . i told her to .
i think you know what you have to do .
and you 'd be listening to every word she said .
give the average agent time to escape ..
and that radius is expanding every minute .
the nazis ' gold to south america .... . at the end of the war ...
shipping companies in the world .
if we keep them broadcasting for long enough .
ten minutes and counting
so i 'll give you this message directly .
you could just shut up , thank you very much .
most people would think that 's a weird thing to say ...
on that night ..
and after killing penny
and stiff and brittle like a cracker .
my life is filled with guys like harlo landerson .
i learned how to handle myself .
shift down , man ! go easy .
you should probably get that looked at .
does being a police officer
but it is one of the perks of the job .
call me strange .
he 's so strange .
i think where you 're going is a home for the spirit
the dead don 't talk
busted furniture and shattered glass everywhere .
whenever we do it that way ,
or he was gonna do it again soon .
son , you so complicate my life .
they 're attracted to evil like bees to flowers .
they don 't show up for any ordinary death .
penny kalisto 's death wasn 't horrific enough
tell me the truth now , odd .
no . no , all i see is my own insensitivity ...
hey , vi , the the dead guy in your dream , what was he wearing ?
i found a gateway to hell .
most people would have the good sense to run away from it .
not in the least .
or hidden .
t don 't know
well , hello fungus bob .
no , i didn 't open his refrigerator .
i wasn 't looking for any .
we don 't know what this guy 's planning to do yet .
wait a minute . what 's today 's date ?
the page to august 15th is torn out of his calendar .
hold on . hold on .
maybe he has a file on himself , you know ?
oh , you don 't have the advantage of seeing his fan club , sir .
you know sometimes you expect me to walk a dangerously narrow line .
son that sounds perilously close to being bullshit .
but it 's mostly sincere .
i can 't hold him .
if strange and suspicious were enough to put someone in jail .
you 're gonna watch him right ?
you go and have your dinner with stormy .
she must love to hear you say that .
you better not be hauling any dead guys on my scooter .
it 's hard enough living with a guy who helps dead people without having to
we will be .
stormy , what body part am i supposed to listen with ?
come on ! it 's fungus bob !
e followed me . i don 't know how
you don 't think the two of us could kick his ass ?
oz , oz , watch your blood pressure .
and if it wasn 't for a little righteous outrage every now and again
perfect .
it 's a steel heart 6 inches in diameter , like you said .
" a piece of steel 6 inches in diameter to go over a heart . "
i mean , why would stormy wanna wear that ?
i keep having this image of a ..
chief , you know i love oddie desperately ..
and now i find out there 's a guy trying to kill him .
what , you think he was hitting on you ?
a geyser .
time feels like a powerfui black wave
something doesn 't feel right .
are you nuts ? everything 's wrong .
and i 'll bet you it 's going to happen here .
but tomorrow , any of them could be any where .
i need to see viola .
odd thomas , right ?
miss lewellyn .
so you know this guy , right ?
yeah , chief says , if you see him reach for his pocket
i 'm not adorable .
puppies , puppies , little puppies , are adorable .
i had a feeling i 'd see you tonight .
you said you were shot .
where are you in your dream ?
are you planning on going bowling ?
what are your plans tomorrow ?
a lot of people died in that dream of yours , huh odd ?
and right now i wouldn 't even if i could .
and when they eventually find out that you can see them ?
well , i sure hope i don 't end up like tom jedd hanging out at tire world .
hey . hey , stormy .
look , stormy , if you want us to go , i 'll go .
so scared , ever since i saw that creep rungus bob .
i promise you on the other side of tomorrow
oh , god !
i saw the dogs following her . i grabbed my gun .
he dropped her off at home clocked in at 8 : 00 ,
his name 's kevin goss .
then he went to starbucks till they closed at midnight .
sir ? : i 've actually seen those rottweilers before .
all right !
simon , i want you to go back over to robertson 's house .
sir , no offense , but i wasted most of the day staking out that house
sir , are we sure this robertson character isn 't just a wild goose chase ?
he didn 't leave a single print .
come on . what
i think the last time i saw fungus bob alive
why he blames me or who the hell killed him is a little hazy .
it 's just me , rosalia !
oh , give me a break .
i 'm gonna borrow your car again , okay ?
all right , bob , where can i put you to quietly decompose for a while ..
interesting story , bob .
it went through a long series of owners .
and the free-soft-drink-refill policy was generously honored .
never succeeded in winning over the family-dining crowd
a lot of people died in here , bob .
stormy 's always joking about running off to las vegas and getting married .
should have listened to her
if that 's you again , odd , we are going to have words !
no offense , odd thomas , but i can 't think of anybody ...
so you think he knew the shooter ?
which means it 's probably somebody i know , too .
besides , you said yourself ..
so , which is it ? do i have free will ?
or is it both ?
oh , yeah ? it 's what makes us crazy and die younger .
i love you more than life itself .
knock , knock .
something to lead me to his partner
loop me in , odd one . where are you ?
yours , mine , or fungus bob 's ?
you are not allowed to go playing around in any more hell gates .
sorry .
someone has been buying a lot of burke and bailey 's .
may be the best , but it 'll still melt in hell .
enough already , bob . please
assembly ...
simon , i 've been dying to know what that tattoo means .
it 's varner .
i should 've known .
fungus bob had gotten aggressive with me an hour earlier .
he had already killed bob 5 or 6 hours before that .
that must 've been varner waiting to follow me home ..
or shoot me while resisting arrest .
stormy .
how about i eat and you read ?
all right , varner , where are you ?
stalking someone at the mall , bern ?
oh , it 'll look like an accident all right .
already been there , done that .
i 'm gonna finish you off , old man .
well , that 's just jiffy .
the wonderful wizard of oz
viola ! what are you doing here ?
you scared the
and nicolina wanted to get a card for her big sister .
i thought in a big stadium or at the water park or a bowling alley .
come on . come on , come on . go on .
that she picked up the bucket of water that stood near .
which side are you on , anyhow , fish ?
maybe you 're gonna go extracurricular with it , then .
is there a problem here , deputy ?
is this yours ?
come on , sucre . you 're going to the shu .
i said move along .
well , i got news for you , fish .
what the hell were you thinking , michael ?
the infirmary .
it 's the weakest link in the security chain .
as long as the good doctor thinks i 'm diabetic ,
a little work .
that 's the idea , anyway .
there 's a little hitch in getting the pugnac .
this thing 's riding on a bunch of pills ?
now 's not the time to trust a black inmate .
nothing transcends race in here .
good behaviour you 're outta here in three years .
it can 't be done .
no one 's ever broken out of fox river .
every contingency ?
you so much as look at these guys the wrong way , they 'll cut you up .
are you the tim giles that represented lincoln burrows ?
i 'm not a reporter . i know the defendant .
not exactly .
well , look , ma 'am , i , uh ..
the prosecution 's case was a slam dunk .
if you 're suggesting that the federal government rammed this thing through ,
the evidence was there .
he gets into a public altercation with the guy , so , he gets fired .
the murder weapon is found in lincoln 's house ,
well , work faster . i need that stuff tonight .
you get me that pugnac and maybe i 'll tell you .
this here 's for the family .
how about you hand that over ?
you could do some serious damage with it .
i seen you with the negroes , you know .
white on the outside , black as tar on the inside .
girl scouts ,
that 's judgment day
i 'm not quite sure i heard that , fish .
that 's right .
in for an inch , in for a mile .
you want me to fight , i 'll fight .
all prisoners return to cells .
know what i 'm sayin ' ?
no problem .
it 's the , uh , surveillance tape of the garage that night .
i thought it could help you out .
maybe all this is the truth .
badge !
you talking again ?
happy birthday to her , then .
i 'll give you a million dollars , if you let me use the phone .
you got something like 40 cents to your name .
god , no !
yeah , it 's okay , hector . you go ahead .
i think i 'm just going to take a cab .
look .. i love fernando to death , but the guy 's a deadbeat .
mr. giles ,
i 'm afraid we 're going to have to insist .
yeah . so ?
that 's right .
it 's for one of burrows ' old girlfriends , man .
i figured it 'd , you know , help her with closure
it 's the freedom of information act .
i don 't know who that is . take a message .
leticia , thank you for calling .
whoa , whoa , whoa . where who can 't get to us ?
no , no , no ... you just name the time and the place .
go easy , lady
where they can 't do what they do .
it was an overdose . wasn 't no overdose
if he touched the stuff , it 'd kill him .
they killed him ' cause he knew things .
like what ?
wasn 't crab , that 's for damn sure
you got nowhere to run .
trapped like a pig i 'm going to slaughter .
uh , michael scofield .
little bit late .
scofield ! infirmary !
i 'm gonna find out , you know ...
how long does this take ?
really ?
so you 'll go to the doctor who convention with me next week ?
oh , i actually did hear your eyes roll that time .
no kidding .
what do you think this object sounds like ?
so , what do you think we should do with this room ?
i just .. meant a question about the drug .
let 's put that aside for a minute
here is a man raised by an overbearing woman
find me when you 're done .
excuse me , sweetheart .
well , my lady friend , gabby margraff ,
a c.t. ?
oh , boy you know , i haven 't seen her since , but ii
oh , yeah .
okay .
great . is there anything else i can do for you ?
sounds like a dream .
i got the chair . i got the girl .
oh , abe , this is all too sudden .
you know , you 're a wise ass .
gabby , i 'm gonna need you to take some deep breaths .
wilson , go down and find someone to tell abe
wilson , we have enough hands here .
you 'll see him when you wake up .
okay ?
all right , let 's try for a step , rachel .
one step .
step , the chair , we stop .
it didn 't make sense , but it sure was exciting .
whoa , whoa , whoa ! you can 't just leave .
sorry , cookie , things are breaking apart back home .
and warn the community . she tends to wander !
mom , dad , do you have granny 's teeth ? she can 't find them .
guys ? where is everyone ?
sid ?
what ?
they left .
come on , what kind of sick family would ditch their granny on someone ?
that 's just ...
what 's the life expectancy for a female sloth ?
yeah , the spiteful ones live the longest .
water , water , everywhere

hey , lady , have you seen precious ?
that you keep searching for , no , i haven 't .
where there 's birds , there 's land , right ?
no , wait , wait ! come back .
four passengers . ripe for the taking .
in my ocean ?

i hear laughter .
hey , they look fluffy .
wow .

right , boys ?
captain gutt , here to help .
look , we don 't want any trouble . we just need to get back to the continent .
my family 's there , so if you could just .
i hope you said goodbye , because there 's no way back .
you can sail to switchback cove and catch the current back from there .
okay .
i just gently press here .
and go down like this .
i still don 't get it .
the easter bunny and a giant bag of pudding ..
no one 's going to stop me from getting back to my family .
hey ! gutt ! flynn ! anyone there ?
no , go away . i 'd rather drown .
i said i didn 't need your help .
okay , that 's a little weird .
honestly , a little scared .
everything we knew is gone .
i mean , not scared , but , like , concerned .
try and get our minds off all this stuff .
you did almost flatten me this morning .
yeah .
so what do you think ?
i 'm talking about the current .
yeah , that 's great . too bad we don 't have a ship .
well , that 's a flawless plan .
it pains me to say this , but .

this place looks like a war zone .
hey , and heads up about graham .

they usually don 't squat upstairs ' cause the ceiling is leaking .
yeah . listen ...

from a military perspective , this has been invaluable .
and why wouldn 't they ?
but he 's ust a kid .
stay here with your mom and the kids !
arash , please don 't go ! don 't do this !
yes ! yes !
you 'll notice children in the streets as well .

these guns got bodies on ' em , jerry ?
you gonna buy this shit or not ?
what 'd you say ?
i think you 're a goddamn cop !
i 'm not showing you my phone !
put your phones on the table .
what ?
so unless we sway public opinion , the battle 's lost .
wow factor off-the-charts .
a figure they can rally behind .
we can 't put a machine on the streets .
you saw the polls .
they want something that knows
you 're you because of your brain .
relax , and jus do what you 've always done .
the music doesn 't come from your fingers , michael , it comes from your mind .
that 's not good for business .
i 'm gonna go hard after lake and daniels .
hey , vallon , i 'm walking up right now .
you were right . we should 've had backup .
you 're not really sleeping , are ya ?
he has let himself 20 a little since the accident .
each projectile releases up to 200,000 volts . it can stun , it can kill
.50 caliber or larger can penetrate and kill .
if you sense you need a weapon or are threatened
or , in your case , what .
oh , just stick to your job .
rio , congo , you name it , i was there . our machines run perfectly .
ee looks like a billion doll ars .
raymond sellars .
i really appreciate everything you 've done for me .
you just do your best today .
i hit you , you go back to the drawing board .
do a little damage , but they can 't take you out .
alex , listen to me .
do not let that happen .
you 'll feel more pain than you 've ever felt in your life .
all right .
three .
whatever you do , don 't get shot in the face .
dr. norton , how is he doing this ?
i was waitin ' to hear you say that .
have not stopped people from showing up .
you know , a lot of questions on people 's minds today is what will he look like .
rumor has it he is in the building preparing to come out ..
that means you 'll have instantaneous access to criminal records
but you 'll be taking away his emotions .
doctor , you 'll be taking away his ability to feel anything
dopamine level 's at 20 % .
cancel ' em . cancel all of ' em .
let 's keep the wife at a distance for now , as well .
can you arrange that ?
alex was so nervous , we had to sedate him .
and then he just shoots a man in front of our son . that 's not sedation .
we both knew from day one ,
i promise ,
detective murphy will have full access to all investigations .
if he requests to take over a case , the case will be handed to him .
this is bullshit !
i 've selected 13 targets for today , all wanted for murder .
i 'll be taking over this case .
i wish you all a very good day .
you okay , man ?
can 't wait to get back to work .
two weeks ago , omni 's stock went through the roof
i certainly hope so .
hubert dreyfus .
hello , pat . mr. sellars .
the american public is divided on the dreyfus act .
there is no doubt omnicorp created a sensation
no . look , look , look .
what they care about is efficiency and they care about safety .
which begs the question .
yeah , hi .
call me tomorrow
i 'm out here makin ' money .
what took you so long what the hell is all this shit ?
what are you doing to protect me ?
and tell me your phones are off .
he can 't manufacture evidence outta thin air
you have to shut him down .
adrian , give me an image of his brain .
his dopamine levels are coming back to normal .
haven ' the faintest idea .
i wanna run some tests .
and your phone on the table !
whoa !
we work for antoine vallon
you broke my hand , man !
thirteen serial numbers match weapons missing from evidence .
this is bullshit .
so put him on the payroll . why we talkin ' about this ?
what is that ?
i kill a cop , i 'm lookin ' over my shoulder ..
being locked up with the same dudes you put in there ?
don 't shoot me . okay ?
she helped pull those guns . just don 't shoot me .
you can cuff him now , jack .
been splattered across the 6 : 00 news .
well , she 's the chief of the detroit police department .
you know what ?
alex , i don 't know if you can hear me .
and in so doing , you shed light on an invaluable truth .
they can be bought .
americans could be living in a country
and for all that you are .
ms. kline , how do you think the attempt on detective alex murphy 's life
how many times does detective murphy have to give his life for his country ?
senator dreyfus is my friend .
but despite all that , i work for the state of ohio ,
the dreyfus act must be repealed .
i spoke to the senate liaison and it looks like it 's in the bag ,
what the hell is he doing ? sorry , sir . i don 't know .
get out of the way .
clara , take david and get out of the way now !
are you here to cuff me ? all right .
you care not why i 'm headed west ?
settled out west . it was all my fault .
we love each other . sure you do , kid .
sit down .
it must have been winter when rose passed through here ,
and she does not waste words .
you haven 't bedded her , have you ?
trading post up ahead .
perhaps .

no . no , i don 't think i will .
in my normal voice ?
the most pressing problems are his hip dislocations .

dr. torres , wait .
i knew that already , dr. grey .
look at the cap refill .
dr. grey , is that bad or good ?
all right . so what do you want to do ?
all right . time 's a factor here , grey .
because the longer his hand stays in there ,
that is his favorite thing to do .
i can 't help it , ' cause he is one .
would you ?
i am talking about after .
no , i told you when it was relevant to the relationship .
that is when it would 've been relevant .

hey , man . okay ?
girl , okay ?
enough .
she says she has no memory of anything , before falling in the bay of gotham .
not having control of his powers is more than something to explain .
that is why it is in quarantine , able to control himself .
i am willing to grant him the benefit of the doubt . for now .
problem .
no . because i remember .
both believed that the planet was doomed ..
he told me that the system navigation would take me to earth ...
ehe had just left , when
so there was alight , a horrible light , blinding
remember the name of his mother ?
why not trust me ?
you think i hurt my own cousin ?
their presence felt because i thought i heard your heartbeat .
you have no heart .
but he thinks it has the qualities to be captain of the guard ..
bring them , to experience my lance .
this was no match for us .
you disappoint me , granny goodness .
come on , before someone tries send me to sleep without dinner .
seemed about break the neck of artemis .
how do you expect me to react , with a sword in her throat ?
and that is why it is better kara maintain without knowing it .
this is the safest place for her , clark . my army is ready .
this is a good time .
protect kara . i take care of it .
there is closing .
we know it was forced doing horrible things .
now , he picked up kara , my cousin .
you have no idea what they will face .
he speaks as if he thought going back .
there exits of that hell , superman .
it was a mistake to come .
on one condition .
i know the strength of darkseid like the palm of my hand .
already swallowed . and you two ?
it smells like death .
he knows .
we have given the plant darkseid 's fortress .
good luck .
first , you .
where you grew up , barda , is where you will die !
i should never have come back , barda .
i will send her to hell gillotin ..
they take position trying to separate us .
furies , destroy them .
glory to take the life the kryptonian .
they are very good .
he said that i 'm free to go . if i want to .
great . now kill him .
great . my work will be much easier .
must be something he ate .
now .
no . i 'm the one you want . release .
make it bleed .
go ahead ! kill me .
whose sole function is tame his spirit .
but he influenced me ?
you 're here with me .
you told me once that would not be defending anyone .
where they can live safely . where can adapt .
are you sure that 's a good idea ?
lyla .
it was my first friend and accepted me without restrictions .
now , i can only find what it is .
diana , do not know how can i thank you .
alura .
alura was .
thanks .
it may take a little . reporter 's salary .
welcome to smallville .
your honour !
he has a brand on the left side of his face !
they come in and ... they haunt me . the got into my rooms !
quiet , please !
quiet ! quiet !
i am aware of the word . schooling ?
honestly freddie , it 's a bit much .
of course , we , the august delegates of the oxford university press ,
forgive me that is incorrect . we are , in fact , going backwards .
this great tongue of ours , which reaches out across the world
at this moment , the endeavor is dead .
gentlemen , i am afraid that nothing short of a panacea is called for .
your account , though a bit dramatic , is true , freddie .
qualifications come to mind . perhaps a bachelor 's degree .
i am fluent in latin and greek , of course .
in the teutonic branch , i am familiar with german ,
i also have a useful knowledge of russian .
and to a lesser degree , uh , aramaic arabic , coptic and phoenician
mr. murray , a word comes to mind -
clever : adjective .
uh , probably from the low german , klover .
mr. murray is also a master of the scottish clog dance .
i scarcely believed in the chance myself .
i 've never known how to resist it . your exuberance ...
and to abandon all this , the school , the constancy .
minor , william chester . an american , 48 years old .
no known religion .
assigned to block two .
here you go .
constantly leaping from his bed to
doctor richard brayn .
can you believe it ?
written ! in the athenaeum ! in a single sentence !
beyond which it should fix all spellings ,
already quite seduced , i would say .
what for ?
for breaking up the home . for dragging you here .
i need this promise from you .
an appeal to the english-reading public of great britain ,
we know how hot boiling water is . how long a yard .
yet we have neither chart nor compass
fly your words to oxford .
what are you doing . father ?
but , what for ?
god has sent us a savior .
thank you , mr. hall .
you cannot fathom the impact of both your offer and your timing .
let paper and ink be our flesh and blood
may i , sir ?
thank you ..
together we shall shrink the darkness until there is only light .
aha ! here it is .
formed with crossing lines , like an x. an intersection .
we 've only just started . partners . word for word .
how does an american come to eye these gates ?
one oxford , one yale .
one brilliant , one mad .
where to from here ?
scripture . you 're a man of god . i should not be surprised .
i wish i had to experienced that a more often .
goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life .
you are not alone , good doctor . we are linked now .
mrs. merrett . mrs. merrett .
you cannot read .
i don 't need you to bring books , mrs. merrett . it 's your visits .
i can teach you .
you can teach your children .
i can fly out of this place on the backs of books .
i cannot .
have a quiet word with bradley .
james , what 's the matter ?
the day has been one of loss .
there is nothing you can tell me to make this right .
how long have you known about his madness ?
why are you so angry ? what difference can it possibly make ?
he fooled that jury , and he fooled you .
the delegates , your team , your family .
stop !
this one hits his children , that one 's on the whiskey .
how many new words replacing the old ?
how many of them in your all encompassing book ?
not if it springs forth from life .
you 've given us is its heart along with a great jolt
but it will never be completed .
ada .
we believe we can keep to our desired target
well , gentlemen , i believe we are all now sufficiently informed
i would like ask permission to say a few words in his stead .
my family and i have given much for the glory of the delegates , mr. gell .
of course , mrs. murray . we are here to listen .
my husband has this silly little leather parchment ,
constant and earnest effort to accomplish what is undertaken .
there are fat pigs , there are fat cows .
all right , i want you to visualize a sexy seagull .
right over there . full extension .
four years of my life , vern .
look , o 'neil , i get it ,
but it 's also okay to just give people something
you know , how , when you get a coffee , it 's just , like , coffee ,
yes , foam , froth , you get the point .
you ever heard the expression ,
it 's nice . and you 're giving people
.. " candy . " the point is ,
i will see you at the office !
are you kidding me ? how did you get my number ?
tf i could just ask one more question
wait , wait , wait .

it was night , it 's dark already
and he ... he left behind this symbol .
i can 't remember where .
there is a vigilante in this city .
i know . and now i have my story .
what ?
all right , we need a lead for tonight . who 's got it ?
capture the vigilantes however you can .
no one will stop us in our quest
ladies and gentlemen ,
well , it looks like you 're doing a pretty good job .
thank you . it 's , uh .
as long as you are true to yourself ,
i 'll see you on tv .
i know this is a story that actually matters .
that 's a good idea . i should chase that down .
april !
shots fired , broadway and centre street .
and taking hostages with them ..
i 've done this before .
this is insane .
there were a couple of them !
they saved us .
let 's go , guys ! both sides !
great elbow , donnie .
this is our city ! these are our streets !
whoo , tang !
we 'll find you , o 'neil .
we will find you , though .
did you see me back there ?
fall in , quietly .
so , guys , if it wasn 't already obvious with that girl ,
i ain 't going back to the ha 'shi .
well , bro , you won 't have to worry about me
i 'm going out on my own . first chance i get .
you 're the hype man !
oh , no , my worst fears have been realized .
we 're not in danger .
find the girl . bring her here .
find the girl .
so they 're aliens ?
they 're reptiles .
okay .
i ... the animal kingdom is full of
yeah . no problem .
hi , it 's april o 'neil , here to see eric sacks .
i 'm sorry to barge in on you like this , mr. sacks .
thank you .
i think you and my father may have created them .
well , um , it was a dream .
what if it isn 't dead
you didn 't lose everything in the fire
it would save the city , it would save the people .
running in their blood
i thought they died in the fire . how ..
by donatello . remember me ?
we told you we 'd find you . meet us here .
you shall be punished and stuff
that fateful night started like any other .
your father made sure our vital signs were strong
tin there
alarms sounded
was terrified .
and ushered us to safety .
we wandered the sewers until i found this place .
we 're taking it to the next level ,
nobody that believed me , except for eric sacks .
just as i feared .
the shredder .
iee 's like a father to hi .
wait , wait
because , raphael ,
oh , no ! oh , no ! we got two breaches .
mikey , flank right ! donnie , on me !
stand by to set charge .
well , don 't let them hit your skin .
over there !
wassup , bra ? oh , you think you can handle this , huh ?
meant to do that ! i meant to do it !
why are you always telling me what to do ?
i got this !
i got a safe place for you to hide .
what is with the .
what do you want to do ? you wanna head downtown ?
they just kidnapped the vigilante turtles
right , right , right . the turtles . i forgot .
we 're both very good-looking
but the point is , we don 't need to make up excuses
i get it . i would too .
come on , leo , wake up !
guys ! shredder 's chopper is 20 miles
if you 're gonna be nasty about it
don 't forget that old guy !
oh , come on .
twelve seconds and we 're going over !
just 290 . go ! no !
no , i 'm not getting up .
it 's a simple command-line interface .
i mean , i 've read about it online .
thinking there was no way i 'd ever be in a position
no , no , no , no !
i just ,
every time i pushed you , i
i believe in your spirit and your intelligence
i love you guys so much !
we 'll make sure we 're on the same bus every morning .
lance and kaye rule the school .
there 's nothing either of us can do .
we 're nothings now .
hey !
hold out your hand .
abracadabra !
this is detention , not art class .
oi ! alex elliot !
where are you going ? don 't run away .
go , go ! run , get him !
we 're right behind you !
alex elliot !
hey , lance ! i 've got him .
you and me have got a fight to finish .
hello ? is anybody here ?
come across the garden walls .
the sword has returned .
the sword has been drawn .
senses .
eyes and ears .
find the new king .
the king . the new king . find the new king .
maybe it 's a prank .
maybe there were hidden cameras .
there 's something written on the guard .
what just happened ?
we have a new pupil joining the class today .
greetings , young academicians . my name is ...
go away .
leave us alone !
and this boy among you drew excalibur .
stop it ! stop that !
danielle said they tried to catch it for two hours ,
mortes milles ? is that what came to get me last night ?
their souls enslaved by evil .
but ...
their spell is only broken at sunrise .
is destroyed .
that 's why everything went back to normal after you left .
excalibur .
she was king arthur 's half-sister .
men 's hearts have grown hollow .
and that is why the sword has returned .
that 's ridiculous . i 'm 12 .
you 'll have to find someone else .
so , there 's your sword back .
your quest has been decided .
you must find the entrance to the underworld .
you have been chosen
if i have to transform into my adult self
the path you choose must be your own .
this is the worst and best
somewhere we can think .
see ? none of this happened by accident .
this was meant to be .
how deluded they are .
sir lance , lady kaye .
do us a favor , mertin .
that 's hardly the attitude of a knight , young man .
don 't tell me you 've never heard of the chivalric code .
the code is the cornerstone of a civilized society ,
what the hell is he on about ?
shortcut .
halt !
the chivalric code is the set of rules
break any of these rules from the moment the sword was drawn ,
oi ! mini merlin ! what are you doing ?
indeed , we are not .
was it a temple ? a burial ground ?
stonehenge is a transport hub .
uh , excuse me !
hey , wait ! security ! security !
you see ? they 're all linked .
built as a magical conveyance system ,
a simple duplication spell
i do magic tricks for a hobby ,
i 'll be most impressed if you succeed .
so , let us begin .
use this to your advantage .
nor can they use its weight to hasten their speed .
be brave and resolute .
it must be the code .
i spoke the truth at all times .
" honor those you love . "
how could you do this ?
i 've been worried sick .
mum , i 've got something to tell you .
i met my aunt sophie .
i know you lied to me about the book .
he didn 't even sign it .
quickly now .
my name is alexander elliot .
then i found out it wasn 't just any sword in a stone ,
i know , i know , i know it sounds ridiculous ,
and if you don 't believe me ,
guiet . quiet . listen .
then you must destroy her so that she can never return .
we can do it , merlin .
we have to do it .
this is it . good luck .
they 're through the gates .
now ! go ! go ! go !
amazon expedition , day seven .
we 've reached the center of the rainforest .
struggling for survival
with the last remaining family living under protection .
we 're famous !
and if there is , we will find them and protect them .
hi , linda !
all this time , i thought ..
hey , it hasn 't been all bad .
but just imagine if there was a whole flock of us .
we gotta do something .
yeah , we have to fly to the amazon and help linda and tulio find them !
why not ?
we 're not people , we 're birds .
they need this . we need this .
t don 't know
yeah !
wait . what 's the amazon ?
due to illegal logging and farming
and if there is , we will find them and protect them .
that would be me . okay , everybody can go home now .
hey , big bird ! break a leg !
you can 't see it coming
yeah , along with a bunch of notes i never heard of
you catch my drift ?
i am going to the amazon .
the amazon ? wow , that 's wild .
i 'll be in charge of this .
hey , dad , look at this .
actually , bia , all those stories are highly exaggerated .
that 's sick !
all right , bird . fick a fortune .
you 're doing great , nigel .
come on , gang . almost there .
according to my little friend here , this boat will get us there by morning .
two million square miles of jungle ..
don 't think so .
illegal .
and that 's why you
the rest of you , go cut some trees .
for years , we have been on the run
a place we can finally put down roots .
my daughter is home !
jewel ?
aunt mimi ? aunt mimi !
my little wildflower has returned !
and look at the little ones !
and have the best carnival show ever .
sorry to break it to you , city boys .
nobody leaves the tribe .
what ? : what 's his problem ?
we already are super-mega-dope , but .
thank you , but we 're fine .
real estate must be pretty cheap around here .
this old nest ? it 's just something i put together last minute .
and my strength .
i can barely look at it . you gotta lose that human pocket , okay ?
" fanny pack . " adorable
" joining the tribe " ?
no . he 's just excited we 're all here .
besides , it won 't kill you to leave behind the fanny pack .
happy wife , happy li
yeah . sure . bye .
wake up !
what happened to " amazon untamed " ?
and we preview the show tomorrow .
come on , chop-chop . let 's get started !
any time you 're ready .
we are the amazing capoeira turtles .
we 're here on our honeymoon .
it 's karaoke night .
linda , logs aren 't the only things these guys cut .
yeah , that 's actually why i 'm here .
go on
you look familiar . don 't i know you from somewhere ?
bob . zes . bob , the bird .
well , at first i was afraid
oh , no !
we 'll see you at the performance tomorrow night .
everyone ?
be happy we 're only plucking you , porcupine .
instead of chasing that bird all over the jungle ..
you , my little gabi ...
it will be a performance ...
it only works when i do it .
hey , sweetie , there you are . what 's taking you so long ?
the whole tribe 's gathering to watch the sunset . come on .
they are just on the other side of the grove
but i 'm sure if he met them , he would change his mind .
yeah , blu ...
but i thought that was our plan .
you know , maybe some places shouldn 't be found .
she ate a bug . a bug !
calm down ? we had a plan .
but when i mentioned it to her , she completely shut me down .
he 's got this weird thing about humans !
a pet ?
i can 't believe he used the " p ' word to my face .
he 's not one of us , roberto . keep an eye on him .
he is always hovering around jewel . he is always singing something
try to see this place through her eyes .
that 's just nasty , thinking about it .
i 'm sorry . sorry .
glitter is absolutely essential for a magical performance .
guys !
ring a bell ? come on . you 're coming , right , dad ?
that girl put the " business " in " show business . "
what a glorious morning !
no , no . don 't do it
finally !
this is my most important tool .
i guess old eddie 's rules don 't apply to everyone .
i didn 't know that . sorry .
you come over here , take our food .
no , no , no . this is all just a big misunderstanding .
you seem like a nice bind
i hope you don 't mind .
lollipop ?
jet 's see if it will return the favor .
a new player is coming off the bench . is he a secret weapon ?
hey , i 'm open !
hey , pass to me , i 'm open . i 'm wide open !
thanks for the pass , blu !
pass the ball ! pass the ball !
no , this bird 's got it covered .
it looks like the secret weapon just backfired !
i 'm gonna kill you , fanny pack !
we 're gonna be talking about that for a long time
what happened back there ?
we still got it , blu !
hey ! get away from that !
lollipop ?
what are you doing ? let go !
come on , let go !
and no psycho-on-wheels is gonna change that .
he 'd better not show his face around here ever again .
the last time i spoke to orson ,
and i should have done something .
is that for me ? ahem .
hey , i know this trick , and if i let you open it today ,
and i am totally gonna fall for it .

oh , how could i say " no " to such sad
kitty , fetch .
rufus ?
hello .

i don 't want to die alone . bree .
i don 't want to waste away in some hospital bed .

i tried to get him to leave , he threw a punch ,
i 'm starting to think that a tie
you 're not nervous about your first day back , are you ?
i just thought i 'd be more excited than i am .
you want excitement , shake things up .

fish !
yeah .
what 's the plan here ?
benny , cover us from under that tree line there .
that 's cocaine they 're growing , so ..
we got working radios ?
in the meantime , you are alone
but what about the other passengers from the accident ?
but tell your people to stop stealing our property .
you fucked up , dea .
sir , careful with that weapon .
tell your guy to put his gun down .
oh , fuck !
that was a living animal , man .
you 're worried about the fucking donkey ?
did you give that fucking kid money ?
we are not killing any more people .
all right , he 'll be there . fuck !
thank you . that 's for you .
so , what are you guys gonna do now ?
not without these .
what ? !
we got alex the cutest prom dress .
well , i don 't like how far down that zipper goes ,
what 's that supposed to mean ?
it 's a major moment in a teenager 's life ,
what 's that supposed to mean ?
you know what ? you know what ?
okay .
i 'm not even gonna wear my glasses !
all right , i 'm going to the mall .
we 're worried about you .
and now you 're just wasting time at the mall .
and plus also
really ?
you know , a year between high school and college
i 've been avoiding that on menus for years .
they 're here ! they 're here !
of course .
okay .
this is our camcorder .
oh , you poor thing . can i get you anything ?
thank you . that 's so sweet .
yes . this way .
and absolutely feel free to say no .
i hate to even bring it up .
no , it 's fine .
what ? oh .
yeah ? i mean , i wouldn 't ask ,
you sure ? don 't just say that to be polite .
even nic ? you don 't want nic for yourself ?
all right . uh ... dang it !
no , afghans are the people .
what do you believe your mission to be here ?
it 's bugging the shit out of me . ma 'am ..
what inspired you to enlist originally ?
we 're the same height ,
fucking hands out of your pockets !
what is this ?
you fucking kidding me ?
the girl at the north face store said it was , like , military grade .
i mean , even the dutch army don 't wear orange .
how do i fix it ?
got to stay hydrated , ma 'am .
that 's ' cause i 'm in warrior mode .
enjoy the ride , ma 'am .
i 'm dying to know who blew. ulp mly wel .
that was a nice fucking well , corporal .
the lead vehicle bottomed out .
didn 't we come this way ?
contact left !
shit ! hot ! hot bullet things !
get down behind the engine block !
that is a word , yes ?
you make me feel like a young man again .
how can we get to know each other , kim ?
yes , excellent , kim !
oh , no , thanks . morning shows .
maybe . i don 't know . maybe .
that 's what i 'm trying to see .
you forgot my fucking birthday !
and i kept your stupid fucking plants alive ,
what ?
you know what ? have fun in seattle .
it sucks . you 'll fit right in .
i have to understand it .
i don 't know , i 'm still trying to understand it .
of course not ,
and what 's so important about this ?
out ? at this hour of the morning ?
where did she go ? she 's always out these days .
i 'm sorry .. ?
it 's a family trait .
if you continue like this , sir ,
i 'm still inclined to four .
yes , you 're right . i 'm changing my bet to three years ,
i understand your disapproval , watson ,
you 're gambling with your own life ?
lady carmichael 's case , what is it ?
i never really say that .
and you 've solved it already , i assume ?
but the bride , holmes ,
you amaze me , watson .
since when have you had any kind of imagination ?
yes , now you come to mention it , that was quite impressive .
save those we make for ourselves .
ghosts we make for ourselves , what do you mean ?
it 's a common enough condition .
the whole thing was a .... bad dream .
well , that 's a grotesque joke .
she married you .
i 'll do my best to save your life tonight ,
yes . in detail , please .
interesting . i didn 't mention she was a woman .
you will not .
well , you tried .
good afternoon .
what was that ?
all the doors and windows of the house will be locked .
hmm , it 's difficult to say quite what he 'll do .
guilt ? about what ?
not a joke ?
orange pips are a traditional warning of avenging death ,
something to do with emelia ricoletti ?
we all have a past , watson . ghosts .
sir eustace knows he 's a marked man .
you think so ?
on the contrary , i have no view on the matter .
marriage is not a subject upon which i dwell .
what 's the matter with you this evening ?
from a retired army surgeon , most certainly .
i concede it .
please don 't .
what did you just say ?
about a note , what did you just say ?
no , they didn 't .
why do you make him tea ?
he said , " there 's only one suspect , " and then he just walks away
said it was so simple i could solve it .
i 'd be offended if you didn 't .
i like your rooms .
manly .
well , you are always away ,
do you have to pose ... during your deductions ?
to distract me , derail me .
hasn 't this all happened before ?
what was it ? what was that case ?
for the sake of mrs hudson 's wallpaper , i must remind you
dead ... is the new sexy .
how can you be alive ?
you can be honest , is it noticeable ?
well , a somewhat shorter exile
what ?
what on earth are you talking about ?
ricoletti and his abominable wife ! don 't you understand ? !
it was a case , a famous one from 100 years ago .
what , like moriarty ?
but you 've only just been told .
yes ? so ? it 's been five minutes since mycroft called .
more to the point , what have you been doing ?
of course .
oh , sherlock .
i was there , all of it , everything . i was immersed .
do you really think anyone is believing you ?
the mind palace , it 's like a whole world in his head .
the mind palace is a memory technique , i know what it can do
oh , there are .
you 've put on weight .
stop this ! just stop it ! did you make a list ? !
everything , sherlock . everything you 've taken .
i 've seen him do it .
wherever i find him ,
i 'm not an addict , i 'm a user .
for god 's sake ! this could kill you !
controlled usage is not usually fatal
emelia ricoletti , i 'm looking her up .
i have access to the top level of the mi5 archive .
what do you think of mi5 security ?
emelia ricoletti , " unsolved , "
i have to go back .
" yapping ? " sorry , did we interrupt your session ?
mr holmes asked me .
no , not him , the clever one .
my theory is that mrs ricoletti had help .
bravo , mary . " the clever one ? "
well , you 're the one who moved out .
you 're working for mycroft ?
and he had a spy to hand . has it never occurred to you
when did it occur to you ?
must be difficult ,
yes , all right . what 's all this about ?
why don 't we go and find out .
all that remained was to substitute the real mrs. ricoletti
but why would she do that ?
every great cause has martyrs .
one half of the human race at war with the other .
not allowed so much as a vote .
to put right an injustice as old as humanity itself .
this is a war we must lose .
who was ?
there were clear signs of consumption -
left her abandoned and penniless .
holmes .
why do you never mention me , sir ?
yes .
even with my resources .
i don 't get it , how is this relevant ?
you mean how moriarty did it ?
but none of that really happened , it was in your head .
i don 't know what you think you 'll find here .
mrs ricoletti was buried here ,
they 'd move it , of course they would .
well , not here .
the conspirators had someone on the inside .
you 're not seriously going to do this ?
spoken like an addict .
no , this is you needing a fix .
moriarty 's back .
getting to that , it 's next on the list .
no , everyone always lets you do whatever you want .
john , please ..
when you 're ready to go to work , give me a call .
you 're what ?
no ...
at any rate , it was a very long time ago .
moriarty ? back from the dead ?
look at that guy in the chute .
where we have got local hero luke collins
he 's a three-time pbr world finals champion .
cut he 's back
you ready for this ?
and today , he will be riding sweet thang
hey , buddy . i 'll be right back .
good to see you . good to see you here .
congratulations , man .
sure does . yeah .
i wanna introduce you to some good folks from pbr .
you got it . i 'll be right behind you .
hey , um ...
but it 's a long way back to the top .
yeah . sorry .
ike this ?
sophia .
i 'm gonna .. can i ... can i get you a drink ?
i think i should be the one buying you a beer .
okay .
hi ! whoa . there you are .
um , this is marcia . she 's my ..
before she comes by .
ts that what ruth would want ?
did you read my letters ?
but yet , with my most important student .
ruth has fallen in love with contemporary art .
i don 't think it stopped . but it 's taken a long nap .
and they grow up and think for themselves .
it 's tragedy !
nothing would make me happier than a lifetime of days like this .
i want a big family . a really big family .
with everything that 's going on now ..
sounds perfect .
don 't know the last thing about art .
i want to marry you .
are you honestly willing to give that up ?
and as far as i was concerned
i know what you 're doing !
when you went to war ...
that you would come home and we would get married .
zoul 're real
and in that moment
it was really nice of you to bring that photo .
well , you take it easy .
it was really good to see you .
that looks good .
no , they didn 't adjust anything
i brought smelly , strange snacks to school .
pants still are too short .
everybody you know is fourth generation cattle ranchers .
why ?
you 're not so bad yourself .
from one happy day to the next .
we began the process of creating a life together .
no , i don 't think you should go in .
they say all bull riders are either stupid or crazy .
i don 't know . i guess a little of both .

it was a joke .
you know how hard i have just tried to fit into your world .
i do !
she laughed . you don 't know that .
does this make sense ?
how are we gonna make this work , huh ?
working a ranch the rest of your life ?

they 're his next of kin and they 're proud people

now , i love you with everything inside of me .
i love you so much , i just want you to be happy .
love requires sacrifice .
and from that day on , sophia ,
even though i saw her every day .

so that they might rebuild their lives .
that armed host will attack this mountain if we do not come to terms

leonard , you 're being selfish .
sheldon , sweetie , shut up .

um , can i have your attention , everyone ?
i would like to propose a toast
that must 've been very hard for you to say .
i 'm really happy for you .

here 's what we 're prepared to offer .
i don 't joke about real estate .
it 's okay , though . i 'm married to one .

but i 'll only stay if you let me contribute .
for that , you can take manny home .

this is how this is gonna go down .
i 'm gonna talk really sweet to you .
oh . slow at first , then ...
he 's not 14
and why wouldn 't he ? she 's so much smarter than me .
they have their little inside jokes .
you and manny have the closest relationship i 've ever seen .
you 're just saying that .
knowing javier 's track record ,
in fact , this weekend , i asked trish to marry me .
i was waiting for the right time to tell you .
i really want trish to wear it .
you see that i am holding a knife .
half our marriage was you with a knife .
fine . i 'll go get you the ring .
and i like trish , too .
well , then i suppose this is
oh , my gosh . this is the best news ever !
now listen , my love .
i can 't do this .
javier , stop . it 'll never work .
we can put butter on your finger .
hey ! not him .
i 've never bought beer before . there 's just so many choices .
i don 't know . is this a lot ?
hey ! not him .
zack here ?

relax , i 'm loaded , i scored 20 big ones last sunday .
sitting there with 3 tens , and some guy with aces up keeps raising me .
my horse came in this weekend .
i 'm a gambler and i don 't know how else to put it .
this is going to be absolutely fantastic .
hi , i 'm here for mr. roland pollard .
how do you do ? ashleigh , this is roland .
first of all , i 'd just like to say that what an honor this is for me .
thank you .
i 'm surprised to hear that someone your age is
particularly the europeans . kurosawa is my favourite .
but you really speak to my soul .
yardley . it 's small .
really , yes .
very sexy . a philosophy major .
well , that 's a ...
i imagine .
are you from new york ?
what does your family do ?
my father owns banks .
i know what you are thinking .
we 're just , totally episcopalians , who happen to just be rich .
who 's your ashley ?
the screening has some last minute changes .
how long does it run ?
one thing about new york city you are here or you are nowhere .
it 's really exhilarating .
i smoke too much .
welleshey .
i heard that you flanked out of freshman year .
he got thrown out of princeton for passing bed checks .
because of his father he 's got like the all-time golden parachute .
it 's a weird way to put it . and millstein is marrying carol durand .
not to mention she 's an ice queen .
what are you doing in town ?
amy is at vassar . big deal . i 'm impressed .
amy was beautiful . yeah , if you like grace kelly .
my girlfriend , she has an interview with roland pollard for the school paper .
it 's a director . he did " winter memories , " " moonlight . "
you should go and watch them shoot . you could be in it .
with that cigarette holder you could be the perfect milk toast nerd .
i wouldn 't trust my girl with a big time hollywood director .
you didn 't ask me what i am doing . what are you doing ?
we have paw at the boarding of grenada .
what ? why not ?
it 's an unbelievable opportunity .
thank you . nevermind .
i used to kiss your older sister , did she ever say anything about that or no ?
a 4 , she said i was a 4 , i don 't know , maybe a 6 .
if we are going to do it , let 's do it right .
action .
are you going to keep your mouth closed ?
i 'm sorry , i think i froze .
her name is ashleigh , she 's from yardley .
don 't do this. making me sick .
it 's humiliating . it 's a process , rollie .
everything that i did is shit . not shit , different , different .
it 's not different . not all the changes work , but some are good .
don 't do this .
please , no booze . what ?
you just watched 2 hours of an existential steaming shit pile
rollie , come on , back . don 't drink .
it 's a bar and the piano for tonight .
i thought the film was full of wonderful things .
because hearing that from me won 't mean anything .
especially a pretty one , maybe ... you may ...
yeah . come on .
no , she 's not gay , she 's charming and beautiful .
goddamn weekend in the city together , and suddenly she 's ...
she 's ambitious , you should find that admirable .
instead , you know . lost the whole , goddamn , weekend .
i don 't really know why ? i 'm having a hard time relaxing , chan .
instead i 'm out here in a ...
don 't tell me , tell her . tell her to get her priorities straight .
okay , look she 's , apparently , onto a very big story .
fine , then get over it .
unless you are worried somebody 's hitting on her .
is she interviewing attractive men ?
some might say they are interesting .
do you think i have to be more demanding , i would .
suits , yes , a director and a screenwriter .
oh , jesus christ !
the sooner the better .
oh , christ , alright .
what do you think i should say ?
without sounding possessive .
now i 'm asking for your help
i can 't talk to you right now . i 'm kind of involved in the situation .
i 'm very busy right now .
ashleigh , we were talking about one movie interview .
what 's so cia ?
i 'll talk to you later . bye , gatsby .
i don 't know , to me it sounds dubious to the max .
you must really love her . i do , she 's a breath of fresh air .
she 's sexy and somehow at the same she 's witty .
i don 't know how to break this to you .
was that your boyfriend ?
what 's gatsby do ?
which he refers to as " forced law on university . "
i think that in his wildest dreams he 'd like to be sky masterson .
i think it has to do with the fact that he and his mom never really hit it off .
he is really smart .
he doesn 't have to study for a test and then he just aces it .
to tell you the truth .
i 'm going to get out of here too .
why , because i have a little bit of time to kill .
look at the weegee exhibit .
you know what , forget it . i dated your older sister .
i 'm not looking for any trouble .
if you want to keep me company .
fine , it 's going to be fun .
alright , let me change , i 'm soaked . are you hungry ?
brings back a lot of memories .
how come you didn 't go ?
you ?
who 's the unfortunate victim ?
it 's romantic .
i 'm sure they 're nothing .
the beach is so pretty in the rain too .
i know ! i know ! under the clock .
the delacorte clock , where all the animals go around in central park .
my mom and i used to watch old movies together all the time .
in my version he 's waiting , the music plays .
or she 's waiting and he chooses the other woman .
that sounds pretty good to me , even if it is commercial .
it 's four minutes to six .
you 're at your delacorte clock in central park .
dermatologist .
would you give me a break , in my version , everything 's fine .
it 's lovely . nobody needs a biopsy .
connie ! ted .
what are you doing here ?
by sheer chance .
she 's a journalist .
she 's 21 , she 's a journalist .
this always happens in bars .
i would like to make a press release about my husband .
sure , go ahead . ashleigh , please .
she 's demented . you 're demented .
were all these women for a pleasure or for some project ?
take this address to the studio , okay , find rollie , come on .
it 's okay , tell the cab driver ...
i did take her to her first crap game .
i was hoping she would get serious with you ,
i 'm glad i impressed you , chan .
she told you about that , every moist detail .
don 't be , that night she gave you a 6 .
with a asterix .
yeah , central park can be a little dangerous at 2 am .
and then it started to rain .
her hair got wet , her clothes started to cling to her body .
now that i think of it , chan .
you are just realising this now ?
you didn 't think i was cute or attractive , anything ?
you mean i had no physical deformities .
you know what , chan , i wasn 't really paying attention ,
i 'm sure ashleigh is a beauty queen type .
4h , right ?
ink it in . let 's get out of here .
how can you say that when you 're in the papers every week
not now guys , not now .
should i be in here ?
would you like to sit down , no , no , no .
would you like to have dinner with me ?
i have no plans , but to get an early bite and then .
party , dinner ?
no , we just broke up .
while you think about it , okay ?
great , now i have to take ashleigh to my mom 's , goddamn , party .
why is that so bad , chan , because i wanted to spend the night
these things have no meaning to me .
what does that mean ?
get a job , put yourself through college .
piano player in the dive .
you 're bad , chan . you are going straight to hell .
and old songs . meeting under the clock .
real life is fine for people who can 't do any better .
who ? your skin doctor .
vega ! francisco !
this is nothing .
sorry , we have to go . sorry .
what do you do ? i 'm no one really .

ciao , ciao , ciao .

they are , yeah .
alcohol plays havoc on my cerebral neurons .
i lose my sensor .
passionate , aggressive , wicked .

i 'm just going to take hunter 's chair if that 's alright .
you sure you want to play this game ?
if you guys are worried , i have a little something .
i will call that .
maybe she 's in some kind of trouble .
maybe the story led her into danger .
should i call the police ?
hey kid , do you going to call or not , that 's two thousand dollars .
with temperature 's in the 60s , rain is predicted this evening .
and more of it tomorrow , mostly cloudy
all our spies could find out is that she 's

that gorgeous couple , as if they need out help .
i need a drink . i need a cigarette .
may i get you another ?
you want a double ?
hello .

this guy is incapable of a real moment .
time flies .

i make dreams come true .
just a little role playing .

the eyes .

lincoln : he committed suicide last night in the cutback motel

he 's protecting himself .
not a lot of confidence in these words .
okay , that means something other than what he 's saying .
posture , shoulders in , for emphasis .
our attorney , veronica donovan ...
the north platte river runs through the city .
it doesn 't mean anything .
i 'm guessing they 're spoon-feeding us every lead

much blame has been placed on another innocent person ,
i took advantage of you ,
i 've considered many ways to apologize ,
uh , body language , his tells ..

i don 't want them coming here for all the neighbours to see
mom ?
when i was little , my mother tried to curl my hair .
she named me katrina so that she could call me kat ,
back to the problem at hand , getting phil to fuck me .
i tried . all he says is that , he 's got a lot on his mind ,
that is the understatement of the century .
he 's just simple .
you can scratch the surface and there 's just more surface .
show me
and when he and his mother moved in last year , i instantly despised him .
even earned a special nickname : garbage .
me , beth and mickey , we were doing what we did every wednesday .
oh , tell me about it . every week it 's the same fucking people
what ?
what the hell is garbage doing here ?
oh , god , what a fucking freak .

fhil , this is kat 's mother , mrs. connors .
she just ... came by to say hello .
well , i 'm just gonna head to my room .
you can rest assured , eve , that my phil will take good care of your daughter .
if your mother was so unhappy ,
because he was there ? i mean , he wanted to marry her .
i mean , she went to college , and she was working as a receptionist ,
the night before she left i noticed that she started dressing different .
can 't say that i have .
mrs. connors sounds so formal . call me eve .
you know , the time when i was your age doesn 't seem so far away to me .
fhil , would you like to have dinner with us tonight ?
oh , god , that 's so hot .
oh , it 'll happen .
i 'm so proud of you .
yeah . i mean , don 't take this the wrong way , kat ,
i mean , you lost all of that weight , like , what , three years ago ?
jixe a fat chick . like me .
you 're crazy. t 's true .
i 'm pleased to inform you that you passed your lie detector test .
why would your dad need to take a lie detector test ?
well , do you think the cops think he knows something ?
you look up clueless in the dictionary and there 's a picture of him .
do you want me to leave ?
kids didn 't spend too much money at the mall , i hope ?
hey , dad , there was a ... . message for you ,
no . they said that you passed the lie detector test ?
i.i don 't think so , mr. connors .

mom ?
is phil a good fuck ?
don 't you turn your back on me !
we 've only been dating for a couple of months .
cindy , you met phil once , for a weekend .
whatever .

i just remembered two more stories .
absolutely we do . let 's fill it up .
there 's this article about these tubes ...
all right , hold on ,
all right , here you go .
and he walks down a set of stairs into a subway tunnel ,
yeah , just for a sec for the game . they were getting off the bus .
oh , no . really ?
they got a bunch of indian boys on their team too ,
probably means they 're
when they put on their jerseys , they looked like grown-ups .
hey , were the lights flickering in here at all ?
oh , just ' cause they were flickering over at the school .
last time , when i was still teaching ,
oh , the line to san mirial has got a permanent signal ,
number , please ?
are you listening to the radio right now ?
can you turn your radio on and tell me
like ...
they came through on top of each other .
all right .
yeah , me neither . and then this lady called .
then i called ethel
but you trust your superiors and you follow orders .
and why is that ?
so what happened next ?
and then when they were done with us ,
what sound ?
you sure it was the same ?
and when we finally took off and i looked out the window ,
and when i got back , then i started getting really sick .
so now i didn 't breathe so good .
maybe radiation .
the power cut off at the radio ...
i do highway hits .
he did the old stuff .
no , we don 't listen to ...
number please .
okay , i 'll connect you .
there 's a lady calling in for the station !
give me a .38 air burst on the following grid .
who is that ? is that strike ops ?
this is cobra , dropping down to carefree .
the bunkers below were empty .
warlord 2

you do have the hut tapes ?
which is very fortunate if you 're a pilot who 've
pursuing to the article 32 hearing
has led us to a stalemate .
called rainmaker , which was a rare opportunity of immense national interest .
whether these men ever see the light of day again
the best thing you can do for yourselves and for your services ..
i believe the prosecutor will agree to a full dismissal .
want to come play with us until your deal comes through ?
the money 's decent .
i am three steps from being a millionaire .
maybe .
my pilots only hit the target 30 % of the time .
we 've waited centuries for our homeland
we 're doing this for our freedom .
you 're in this for the money .
so let 's put something else on the table .
keep doing what you 've been doing
and no freedom .
do you know the best place to see the air show ?
the planes ? air show ?
that was my fault .
but i think we should be okay .
this is me , this is my friend . is that okay ?
and the next time you have a plan , it had better work .
how long is that flight ?
good to have you back , man .
flight adversary , baby .
no , man .
the jet lag 's going on .
mom says we have guardian angel
he must be a very brave man .
charlie ?
no , thanks . gotta run .
that 's how it 's put .
all i can say is
will be fully briefed tomorrow .
if it means to clear our name
some of us have history with this thing here , so .
and let 's be honest , the money is bullshit .
not if we pull it .
i got kerosene in my blood .
alright .
look man .
i 'm out .
i 'll leave the shooting up to you and the rest of the cowboys , this isn 't for me .
well , directors don 't like rewrites , you know ?
it gets really messy .
you know what makes them tick and it 's new again .
and dangerous .
i live in a plane .
it 's a high altitude high opening drop .
across the zangezur mountains to azerbaijan .
i don 't jump out of planes , i fly them .
yes , sir , but i was not very good at it .
technically , you 're not even in the country .
so i get this call .
i was worried about you .
everybody 's worried about poor old tom ?
go to hell ! that 's my girl
it 's that nosy thing that always got us in trouble , remember ?
welcome . sit down , my friend sit down .
enjoy it .
we really have to get back to work , so .
i 'm afraid there 's been a change of plan .
i don 't know
you can 't remember your great-grandfather 's name
and if they were , all they 'd remember ..
tom .
or a poor man ?
but in a year when that oil reconstitute in its pure form .
roger that .
why wake a sleeping bear ?
they 'd never had the chance .
intels said the russians are gonna help the americans .
what if he gets his loyalty confused ? you want to take that chance ?
this is the moment we were talking about .
your son is gonna be here safe with me .
what other kid would get such a chance ?
the biggest difference is that you can not hide from her ,
i can see him .
take him down now !
you take the one on the ground .
12 : 00 clock , coming right at us . two of them .
let 's blow them out of the sky .
see that right there ? that 's him .
you gotta get us out of here , cobra !
viper , where the hell are you , man ?
anna , is grachov with you ?
we can 't do that man .
hold on , cajun .
nice move , cobra . something i didn 't teach you .
we got two missiles remaining
it 's a trap . pull up !
you did a good job .
good listen .
we 're struggling here .
somehow it just doesn 't seem like the right thing to do .
it 's taking us exactly where we want to go .
now , put your foot down and drive a little faster .
all we have to do is get over two 20-foot walls
after you .
and now you have miss teller .
we already knew all that .
you told me this was gonna be a simple extraction .
i didn 't ask you to light up half of east berlin .
don 't flatter yourself . they follow everybody .
i tell myself , solo ,
you 'd be , too , if you 'd been up all night
or are you just looking ?
nevertheless , you 're gonna have to swallow it .
it is now run by his son , alexander ,
but she .
all our informacion indicates a lethal combina tion
we believe they 're responsible for dr. teller 's disappearance .
imagine the consequences
your mission is to infiltrate this organization
and whoever has that disk will simply be
we 'll leave you two to get acquainted .
obviously , i was briefed about you .
until you were caught
i concluded it must be to counteract
my woman would never wear anything like that .
i told you . we 're teaming up with the russians .
and why did he call me his woman ?
give me a minute to explain .
he 's an architect designing a new resort
he 's also managed to secure a visa for his fiance .
and what about you ? what 's your cover ?
perhaps you give them to me .
then gimme some money for coffee .
give the gentlemen something for coffee .
good morning .
is better for the mission
it means i like my woman strong
maybe i get you present .
we might be engaged , but i 'm my own woman .
i wanted to make sure it was serious .
why would she be ashamed ?
but a good german girl knows never to mix
nice to see you .
excuse me , i said i need to use the sink .
i stupidly seem to have lost my invitation .
yes . yes , i think we bumped into each other outside .
i do apologize .
i noticed you 're very good with your hands .
he said , " use the ladies ' "
have the jets been cleansed
i 'd be delighted .
why don 't you pop into the office tomorrow morning
you see , each one of us has a destiny .
you can see the future ?
alone
he had soft bones . and don 't question my methods .
super agent here decided to have some fun
your new boyfriend is a nazi .
meet me on the gantry in five minutes .
i didn 't find anything
i thought that was my father 's watch .
and what exactly did you do to him ?
it takes years to master .
ie ' be like this for 20 minutes .
generator 's back on .
next to hidden button .
want to have a go ?
i thought i was doing so well .
you were doing fantastically well .
however , you couldn 't control the loyalty of young gaby .
i know my father is here and that he works for you .
and the american your wife has been entertaining
really ?
you 're not the first man to have fallen
he 's probably out there in the woods
if you can catch him .
what are you doing ?
and last time , i fell rather badly and hurt my head .
sleep well , napoleon .
mummy says hello .
and my personal favorite :
and today , you have the privilege
my apologies .
i keep telling the maestro to modernize , but alas .
we have contact .
won 't happen again .
rudi 's never in a rush , but sadly , i am .
once upon a time , there was a little boy .
he was neither tall nor handsome ,
year merged with miserable year
ready ?
one is for the extraction of information .
i must admit , this does get frustrating
with the pliers .
i 'm actually quite pleased to see you .
i thought i found all your trackers .
do you mind ?
i 'll tell you everything i know .
what about gaby ?
don 't kick yourself . she fooled me , too .
i 'm yours to command .
don 't go anywhere .
what do you think we should do ?
what should we do wich him
on the one hand , we need him ,
he 'll strike a deal and struggle out of it .
he 'll be out within months
so , what do you think we should do ?
he fixed the glitch .
i left my jacket in there .
i believe your instructions are to follow me , so , uh ...
very well done , my darling .
then we must give them an appropriate welcome .
they are the key
gentlemen , can you hear me ?
a luxurious 14 hours in which to seize the island ,
you have british agent in this ?
i 'm starting to smell the irony .
oh , well done , solo , yep , yep .
my father has been unwell .
he 's ready now to resume his work .
gaby has agreed to assist me to assure i finish in time .
you 're wrong .
it was the only way she could stay in the game .
that would give even the average russian agent
let me translate this into english .
but now you 've lost her ,
well , in a nutshell , yes , please .
so , what does that do ?
it sends a signal which enables another missile
now that we are converting it to nuclear , it 's redundant .
we 're nearly done , victoria .
what are you doing ?
put her in a cell .
that 's how long you have to finish this .
please .
you want to go , you gotta go through me .
is there a point to this or ...
i think you love cristina
her or me ?
no one . i 'm choosing no one .
oh , my god .
we can 't go to the i.c.u .
i 'm taking this patient out of here .
it 's half instinct and half improv ,
you can 't be in there .
we 're ready for you .
meredith is gonna sit here on the floor .
come back now !
look , it took me a long time to find him ,
and now that i realize that ...
you don 't get to cry about that .
she died today .
we need to get to the o.r. !
turn the elevators back on ! turn them back on !
oh , my god ! turn the elevators back on !
that man is still here somewhere .
and he 'll hear us . please . shh .
okay , okay ...
you step back .
owen , i can 't stop . i have to keep going .
you stop or i will shoot you in the head .
you shoot her , you touch her , and i will kill you !
maybe i shoot you first .
i didn 't come here for this . my wife is dead .
mmm-hmm .
did a young man named bobby deangelo stop by ?
his parents are friends of ours .
yeah . um , this other boy , chris .
was it this young man ?
i think pam fixed him a plate . there was so much food .
he , uh ..
and then he asked me for a picture of stevie .
okay . okay .
also , we 're , uh , gonna need to go ahead and get
it 's okay .
last time i seen stevie was about a year and a half ago .
i 'm sure i sold ice cream to all three of those boys .
i used to be involved in the wiccan religion . white witchcraft .
with chris and michael .
we saw , uh , men .
um , he tied me up .
i kicked him .
this is detective bryn ridge of the west memphis police department ,
yeah , i did . jason baldwin called me
i represent jessie misskelley .
he represents jason baldwin .
i understand tessie has recanted his confession .
no . iit 's hard to believe anyone
i 've got a doctor who will testify that jessie
do you think he 's guilty ?
so mr. lax , if they 're most likely guilty ,
and i can 't stand by and watch that happen .
he 's got her lame carved on his arm .
why ?
you 're saying you actually believe that ?
no . i 'm working with them .
i 'm an investigator .
no . no , i 'm not allowed to do that .
those cops are scary , okay ?
why would so many people say all these things about you ?
any time anything weird happens around here ,
didn 't attack him . he offered it .
i 've been cutting myself for a long time .
there 's power in the blood ,
by biting , cutting
these people think i 'm a satamic leader . ' m not .
and they listen to that music .
you think the way they dress had something to do with the
i got it back yesterday , and i 've been wearing it on my head , like that .
oh , yeah . he loved it . he loved it . he did .
um .. yeah , he did .
what the hell are you doing ?
you 're not acting right .
on the tv . treating his scarf like some kind of prop .
i 'm not acting at all , terry . are you ?
i think maybe you 're glad stevie 's gone
every time i spent time with him ,
what ? you 'll hit me ? now that he 's gone ,
mommy ? daddy ?
hey , i tried you at home .
will you meet me for lunch tomorrow , 1 : 00 at the arcade ?
tell me what happened when you got to robin hood woods .
then michael and chris jumped out of the tree .
jessie and damien picked him up
what would you like ?
thanks for meeting me . i know you 're very busy .
the state police . they called me .
they knew everything about our divorce proceeding
i mean , you 're a respected man in this city . you 're not on trial here .
he can send another ome .
these boys that you 're helping
yes . yes , i am .
you know , you lose perspective . you get obsessed .
you don 't have to worry about me anymore .
you know , i just remembered , i have to be in court . early
and then we followed detective allen into the woods .
this trial 's a waste of time . we all know he 's guilty .
then maybe these journalist parasites can go back to wherever they come from .
this ended up being a white shirt
z es
and nobody knows what happened but me .
jessie immediately stated that he wanted to tell us about it .
now , you got in front of you pictures
but this court will not tolerate any verbal outburst ,
" we the jury find jessie lloyd misskelley junior guilty
the sentence . how do you fee about the sentence ?
life plus 40 ? well , it 's fine with me .
and the good lord said lucifer and a third of the angels
wild , crazy orgies , i 've been told .
it 's a war between satan , lucifer and the lord .
i mean , like something suspicious or strange ?
he gave this as a gift to the documentary crew .
mr. fogleman released the records concerning this knife yesterday .
well , we had to send it to the lab first . dna testing .
mrs. hutcheson , you 're already involved .
and from what i can tell , you 're the only real link
you gotta ask don .
yes .
she brought her kid in the day after those boys went missing
you think you might know something to help the police find them boys ?
we questioned aaron .
it made sense to me . i already knew about the satanic cult .
we been expecting something like this
asked her if there was anything she knew about an occult or devil worshippers .
but then she said , " how about i go play detective
you 're a real sweetie to come over here today and do this in this heat .
do you know that boy , damien echols ?
about people painted black , chanting , doing what men and women do .
or anything that would link these murders to damien ?
we got jessie 's confession .
damien gave her nothing
they got their confession from him instead .
ain 't that what our mamas always warned us about ?
so the jury 's never gonna hear
remember gitchell 's ridiculous manipulations with the tape recorder ?
the state sent 600 items to the lab and out of all that they got nothing
remember how gitchell told the press
they actually changed our case number to the number of the beast ?
our boys were never suspects in this case . they were targets .
but we don 't have to . we can keep looking
if you don 't help those poor boys , who will ?
arise and be baptized .
god will never put more on you than you can bear .
uh , none .
i had to fill out , uh , several series of papers .
" call toll free for information on how to become a doctor . "
yeah , you can send in a request for what you want your degree in .
judge , the witness has a mail order phd from a non-accredited school
well , i 'm not sure within arkansas you need a degree of any kind
but based on the polygraph results ,
okay , i 'm gonna lie . i killed them .
are you arresting me ?
chris , what are you doing here ?
your honor , the defense calls christopher morgan .
your honor , i think they are going to try to cross-examine him
we want to question mr. morgan to suggest
your honor ,
judge burnett , don 't you think a confession suffices as a tie-in ?
this is not just anybody off the street .
ladies and gentlemen , i am going to need to conduct a hearing in camera so
what ?
bailiff , will you clear the courtroom , please ?
and why aren 't we allowed to hear what he says ?
i have a right to hear what he says .
on may 17th , 1993 ,
and in a videotaped statement ..
so you said it just to get out ?
now , before you made the statements in question ,
burnett wouldn 't let him testify .
i know .
besides , fogleman says there 's no tape for the part
i saw it . i watched the whole thing
you guys even watch the entire six hours of tape ?
a synopsis ?
ron , we did not have enough time or money .
now , damien , this book on witchcraft ,
damien , there 's some pages in there that are underlined in red ,
i think somebody had a report to do ' cause all through the book
damien , why do you like to wear black ?
and it he ped me deal with people .
zou 've looked into the satanic side of the occult , correct ?
you familiar with aleister crowley ?
he also believed he was god , so ..
correct ?
but crowley has no particular significance to you ?
and when you look at all this circumstantial evidence as a whole ,

he thinks a lot .

which now has a proven track record .
was i really inside you ?
for how long ? at least five or six seconds .

this is just one of the 1.3 million earthquakes ..
the largest ever recorded here in north america :
the energy release was the equivalent of 10 million atom bombs
the coast of valdivia in southern chile
this quake lasted 11 minutes and spawned a tsunami 82 feet high ..
8000 miles away .
well , the san andreas fault runs right up the spine of california .
and we 're about 100 years overdue ...
it 's a matter of when .
played a little tug of war with a car .
i 'll call martinez today . get a new one sent over to maintenance .
harrison said you 're taking off with blake for a few days .
volleyball team has their first game this weekend .
dude , i can 't believe she 's in college already .
lawrence , i gotta show you something . yeah ?
23 small quakes , all tiny . 2.0 to 2.6 in the last 24 hours .
35 miles southeast of vegas , maybe 5 miles from the hoover dam .
there aren 't any faults out there .
and if the magnetic pulse rate goes up before the quakes .
all right .
hi , dad . hey , sweetie .
thought that i could ride it to class , then i wouldn 't have to buy a parking pass .
all right , great . i can 't find the key to the lock at mom 's ..
officials are saying that hoover dam is a total loss .
additional support from los angeles , including l.a.f.d. air rescue ..
hi , dad
no , i get it . this one 's really bad , dad .
what time we heading out ?

i should 've told you before .
she 'd like us to be a family again .
emma .
oh , jesus , ray . i gotta get outta here .
drop , cover and hold on !
what does that mean ?
so it 's a hundred times stronger now !
professor ! it looks like the whole san andreas fault line is being activated .
all right . all done .
well , it was really nice to meet you , ollie . i hope you have fun while you 're here .
good bye .
i almost forgot . do you mind if i borrow your book for a second ?

i love you guys .
hello , chris .
he and his research partner , dr. kim park
but nobody listened to them .
go ahead , doctor . okay .
basically , california 's entire tectonic plate has shifted .
from movement along the fault line .
their end of the fault line has not moved yet .
and it 's not aftershocks i 'm talking about .
and it 's going to be a bigger monster this time .
it will be so big that , even though it 's happening here in california .
now , i cannot emphasize this enough to the people of san francisco :
i never blamed you . i don 't wanna talk about it .
she 's gone . now you 're gone ..
i guess the point is .
the moment she realized
because nothing was the way it used to be . and the way it used to be was .
i should 've let you in .
i 'm so sorry for how things ended with us , em .
if you couldn 't save our daughter ...
let 's go get our daughter .
which leads to coit tower .
one of them used to be my sister 's .
we had given them to each other for christmas the year before .
hey . check it out .
they should have a supply box . it 'll have stuff that we can use .
oh , okay .
every city has a tactical channel
okay .
san francisco has begun evacuation .
.. the fault line in the central valley .
san francisco is going to get hit again , and this will be a much bigger monster .
this is it , isn 't it ?
this will be over soon here .
did you know " nob " is a slang term ..
largest quake in recorded history .
coit 's been burning a while . she 's gone someplace else .
what 's your plan b ?

well , stop giving us things .
you have no way of knowing who gave who the head lice .
they 're 10 . they 're in love . they 're cute .
excuse me , doctor , something 's wrong with clem .
ever thought you 'd be wishing so hard
honey , we 're leaving now .
nico , don 't make me pick you up .
this is embarrassing , you know ?
i don 't care .
she 'll think that i don 't love her .
what if i 'm there when she wakes up ?
it 's like the next best thing to being there .
yeah .
oh , good . uh , all right . here we go .
the ovary specimen you sent is normal .
damn . we picked the wrong ovary .

i 've never really felt like i was part of a family before .
dad had the first camera .
i wanted you to know that i think you are a wonderful brother .
and i 'm really grateful that you invited me .
and we were more than friends . family

oh , shit ! sam !
what are you doing ? are you fucking crazy ?
stop , stop !
we 're gonna get some help . we 're gonna get some help .
you know , we talked about the summer courses .
and then go back to the full load in the fall .
no , i don 't want to just wait until the fall .
i know , it 's just that this has come up and i ...
i know it 's not gonna be easy . but i don 't want to put everything on hold just to ..
i gotta keep working .
then i feel like i 'm not gonna be able to start back up again .
then i 'm gonna turn into your sister .
sam , you 're not gonna be natalie . it 's you and me .
but this isn 't what i wanted to begin with , okay ?
i don 't want to bother sam .
how did we get home last night ?
what the fuck ?
so i came home , looked at all the tapes , and there 's all this mystery fucking ...
ou sure , man ? maybe it 's some weird shit they do down there to scare tourists .
what the fuck ?
what are you talking about ?
it 's empty . it 's gone . the fucking tape is gone now .
e everything i 've seen says they 're , uh , religious symbols .
so , uh , there 's these ones ..
there 's a bunch more .
what ?
" and children , this is the last hour . "
they tried to bring the church down in its early days .
we 've caused the displacement of thousands of families into refugee camps .
the question we 've got to ask ourselves is ...
i wasn 't expecting you to come all the way out here .
are you still chasing space rocks ?
the data is undeniable .
i can 't .. not yet . we 're too close .
is that you don 't have to wait to the commercial to piss .
see pain , i can deal with that .
world 's going to hell anyway . we 're just reaping what we 've sown .
$ 40 . that all ?
one minute it 's a job , next he 's got his cock in your mouth .
they think you 'll charge half the price for just one knee pad ?
what 's that supposed to mean ?
for all the good it 's gonna do .
we don 't we want your fascist war !
all right , all right , come on , people . let 's wrap this up .
we don 't we need .. what the ...
hey , sir ? hey , you look like a smart guy .
then go back to killing children again .
explain why some assholes are moving my scrap .
this some kind of inside job ?
no ? it sure looks like your boy chamberlain to me .
ronan ,
nebula , go to xandar and get me the orb .
it will be your doom .
i 'm a daughter of thanos .
what a bunch of losers .
look at this guy !
what is this thing ? look how it thinks it 's so cool
wanted to be here . sends his love .
what is it ?
yeah , well , i almost died getting it for you .
some machine-headed freak , working for a dude named ronan .
i truly am .
who 's ronan ?
what ? what about my bad side ?
hey , we had a deal , bro !
this guy just backed out of a deal on me .
peter quill . people call me star-lord .
well , you know , i wouldn 't say that .
quit smiling , you idiot . you 're supposed to be a professional .
hey !
like how much this is gonna hurt .
raised from youth by a band of mercenaries called the ravagers ,
i didn 't know how this machine worked .
transport all four to the ky n .
i ain 't gonna be here long
i ain 't about to be brought down by a tree and a talking raccoon .
it 's what you are , stupid .
so , this orb has a real shiny blue suitcase ,
zoul 're scum ! you 're scum !
a lot of prisoners here have lost their families
murderer !
they 're here to stop us from getting out .
whatever nightmares the future holds ,
her life
i sha ' kill one of his in return .
quill ! what are you doing ?
i 'm your only hope at stopping him .
hey ! hey , hey , hey ! hey !
you know , if killing ronan is truly your sole purpose ,
well , i mean , she 's hardly the first woman to try and do that to me .
no , it 's a symbol .
would not slice his throat .
you 've heard of this . you 've seen this , right ?
asleep for the danger , awake for the money ,
we know only that she has been captured .
no ! our sources within the kyln say gamora has her own plans for the orb .
then she was apprehended by the nova corps .
your sources say that she meant to betray us the whole time !
i may be your ..
the only matter i do not take seriously , boy ,
and , apparently , you alienated my favorite daughter , gamora .
but return to me again empty-handed ,
this is one fight you won 't win .
if we 're gonna get out of here ,
the guards wear security bands
man who has ain with an a 'askavariian !
we need all available guards in full combat gear ...
why is this one here ?
i always keep my promises ,
i just need these two things .
no , i thought it 'd be funny .
wait , what did he look like hopping around ?
how are we going to leave ?
right ? or is that another thing you made up ?
shut up .
what is that ?
or if you wanna blow up moons .
you just wanna suck the joy out of everything .
we 're heading in the right direction . for now .
and how much do you trust me ?
because i 'm guessing it 's some kind of weapon .
if it 's a weapon , we should use it against ronan .
i let you live once , princess !
hey !
we 're stuck together until we get the money .
great .
and quill , your ship is filthy .
if i had a black light ,
if he knew where they were headed ,
well , then ,
and this place ?
cleanse it !
i like to stick ' em all in a row on my control console .
in that case , i can show you .
and then you gonna tell me ,
the high-end community is a .
tight-knit .
now , who again is this buyer of yours ?
your people do have elbows , do they not ?
then use them .
do t
be wary headed in , rodent .
hundreds of years ago , the tivan group sent workers in
all rare resources , highly valued in black markets across the galaxy .
well , i come from a planet of outlaws .
it sounds like a place , which i would like to visit .
watch your wallets .
get out of here
get out of here !
what do you expect us to do while we wait ?
my orloni has won ,
that 's the first thing you said that wasn 't bat-shit crazy !
i might actually lose money on this job .
it 's just a negotiation tactic . trust me , this is my specialty .
he tortured me
my mother gave it to me .
i happened to have it on me ,
what do you do with it ?
i 'm a warrior and an assassin . i do not dance .
on my planet , there 's a legend about people like you .
fonan , it is done
these pods aren 't meant to be out here .
aw , damn it .
what happened ?
i don 't know what came over me .
i found something inside of myself
it 's .. well , they got the orb .
blasted idiot . they 're all idiots !
none of this ever would have happened if you didn 't try to single-handedly
was a fool
captain , the shot was non-damaging
it 's a weapon of my own design .
if you don 't hand over our companions now ,
no ! wait , hold on !
we figured it out ! we 're fine !
you call that " figured it out " ?
you want to talk about senseless ?
we were only gonna blow you up if they didn 't turn you over !
we didn 't have time to work out the minutiae
secondly , i don 't even believe you have a plan .
what percentage of a plan do you have ?
i just saved quill .
when did we establish it ?
i wasn 't listening . i was thinking of something else .
what percentage ?
twelve percent ?
that is the most real , authentic , hysterical laugh of my entire life
you 're taking their side ?
so what , it 's better than 11
see ? groot 's the only one of you who has a clue .
come on .
he expects to hear this big plan of ours .
t look around at us .
not run away .
but , quill , stopping ronan ,
yeah , i guess i am .
i have lived most my life surrounded by my enemies .
you are an honorable man , quill .
and in the end ,
what the hell . i don 't got that long a lifespan , anyway .
we 're all standing up now .
the stone reacts to anything organic .
all ronan 's got to do is touch the stone to the planet 's surface and zap .
everything will die .
bockxet will lead a team to blow a hole
won 't there be hundreds of sakaaran soldiers inside ?
once they know we 're on board ,
we 'll make it to the flight deck ,
there are too many of them , rocxet !
peter quill
they got my " dick " message !
they 're dive-bombing the city !
keep ronan up there , saal .
i can 't believe i 'm taking orders from a hamster .
your mother was of earth . your father , well ,
on behalf of the nova corps ,
thank you , nova prime .
do you know what time it is ?
excuse me .
no . , not at all . not at all . this is ms. tuliette .
i can figure this out . let 's see .
the only tree bark i know that humans consume is cinnamon .
incorrect .
what ?
the low-lying city of copenhagen is flooded .
how does one miss that ?
you 're just making stuff up .
oh , yes .
you bumped the table and you know it .
we 'll close our eyes and count to ten while you hide .
very good , leonard .
toilet .
oh , and " potty " is okay ?
what do you do in the potty , wee-wee ?
greetings .
well , just recently , i learned that you refer to us as shamy ,
like everybody else 's .
thank you for asking .
really ? i assumed an establishment called
i believe it 's called " bait and switch . "
first time we 've all gotten together to eat .
penny , i assure you , i 'm fine .
the relationship simply outlived its utility ,
now , if you 'll excuse me , i 'm off to buy a pussycat .
we 're all a little worried about sheldon .
oh , i thought you were just making a generalization :
hey , i don 't want you to go anymore .
oh , dear lord , more rules ? where does it stop ?
okay . do whatever you want .
do whatever i want ..
oh , for god 's sake , just come to the play .
i don 't want to , but at least that makes sense .
is he no longer a part of our social group ?
perhaps , this time , we go latin .
i 've been itching to pull that trigger .
would it help if i gave him some pointers ?
no , it 's not any of that .
i kind of have a hard time
then what were you doing
hi , guys . i know , i 'm a little bit late .
well , once you hear what i 've been through ,
so there i am at the spa ,
so armando was all apologetic . he wanted to reheat the rocks .
oh , armando felt so bad ,
we 're supposed to plan teacher appreciation night .
and maybe one for the car ?
i mean , andre zeller , right ?
but i 'll show him . i have pain .
it 's just , every time i go into that room ,
look , there 's the kitchen . no one died in there .
i 'll pour us a couple of drinks .
i don 't want it to become a thing .
they 're like , " gaby , why are you late ?
oh , my god .
i know what to do . thanks for listening .
oh . wonderful .
well , when most people wanna give back ,
what 's your story ?
and i 'd have the good sense not to answer .
and we 're out of pepper .
have you ever considered making the soup from scratch ?
just get ' em in and get ' em out .
look , these people may not have homes ,
can you get it done by noon ?
it 's just a rustic acorn squash bisque
finally , a blurb for my next cookbook .
i 'm a cancer , and i beat cancer .
that is more disturbing
oh ! online dating sucks .
you want to meet men ? i 'm taking you to a bar .
it 's been 25 years since i tried to pick up a guy .
but my parents did stop talking to me
too bad . i just gave you mad props on my blog .
yeah .
uh-huh . and it 's already been " liked " on facebook
but hey , if i gotta go ...
i can 't let a talented
just let her find a way to deal with what you put her through .
but it doesn 't help her .
i won 't do it anymore .
remember , technique is a crutch .
that way you can begin to find your own voice
taking casual friday a bit to the extreme ,
aren 't we all supposed to be ..
donnie , two .
that 's quite a crowd out front .
well , ever since i took over the kitchen ,
i have never felt more needed or important in my whole life .
of course not . it 's to help people .
so what brings you by ?
well , right here , of course .
ever since you 've turned this soup kitchen
it was already special . it was home for them ,
i 'm sorry. but you 're gonna need to leave .
well , then go eat somewhere else .
whoa . where 's the attitude coming from ?
it 's a dismal failure .
everyone deserves to have a place ,
please go .
don 't worry about it .
speech ?
this is where you live , huh ?
of course . how else are you gonna make fun
did you check your campus e-mail ?
i went out of my way to help you people .
do you really think a hot stone massage
you live in this perfect little fairy tale .
i have two hours
oh , and one more thing .
honey , sorry to bother you at work ,
i need you to meet me at the school .
yeah .
wow . that sounds like a lot .
or he is , and i 'm trying to .
cheers .
i 'd put on some music .
i could turn on a black light ,
oh , no . no , no , no , no , no .
i already said " no . "
my name 's tucker .
" laugh , laugh , laugh . "
we don 't need a parent dropping dead in here .
but i was gonna divide everybody up into
i 'll play , too .
oh , well , you know what ?
hey , guys , listen to this . my name 's cam .
it 's just that if they have two hours in this class
it 's 6 .
nina , i was getting there .
if i could just have a second to think
no one cared who i was till i put on the mask .
it would be extremely painful .
for you .
of course .
we had to find out what he told you .. nothing i said nothing
now what 's the next step of your master plan ?
at the time of his death , eight years ago .
gave law enforcement teeth in its fight against the mob .
and to them i say , " not on my watch . "
and now i 'm gonna give way to an important voice
people put their faith in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape .
and murdered him in cold blood
commissioner gordon .
i have
uh , she 's at the bar , sir . can i help ?
unlock the door , put the tray on the table , lock the door again . nothing more .
and you mustn 't take it personally .
i 'm afraid i can 't let you take those .
of course , sometimes exceptions have to be made
you read my mind .
miss tate was asking to see you again .
and quite lovely , in case you were wondering .
examining print dust . we 've been robbed .
she took the pearls , tracking device and all .
one of the maids .
why were you dusting for prints ?
she was .
the congressman never made it home after the wayne foundation event .
when you and dent cleaned the streets , you cleaned them good .
and yet here you are , like we 're still at war .
blake , sir .
it 's about that night . this night , eight years ago . the night dent died .
he murders those people , takes down two swat teams .
i 'm not hearing a question , son .
i know exactly who he was .
let 's go see about the congressman 's wife .
you haven 't been down here in a long time .
unless she 's lost a lot of weight ..
she 's good .
we do . i cross-referenced the address she went back to ...
selina kyle .
she 's good , but the ground is shrinking beneath her feet .
fascinating . you two should exchange notes over coffee
there 's nothing out there for me .
you hung up your cape and your cowl but you didn 't move on .
alfred
but that 's all part of living , sir .
remember when you left gotham ?
you were gone seven years .
every year , i took a holiday . i went to florence .
i had this fantasy
you wouldn 't say anything to me , nor me to you .
that you were happy .
i always knew there was nothing here for you , except pain and tragedy .
they wash up here a couple of times a month .
homeless , sheltering in the tunnels .
what ?
jimmy hadn 't been around for months .
blake , you know why .
i thought the wayne foundation gave money for that .
i 'd like to , if that 's all right .
lot of guys been going down the tunnels when they age out .
say there 's work down there
so you know about him ?
do you think he 's coming back ?
i like having someone around to open doors for me .
and your weakness has cost the lives of three others .
then i will kill you .
so show me his body .
even if you 're not .
because the money stopped .
some of those details might need your help .
he 's a mercenary . no other known names .
that secured mining operations for our friend john daggett
i 'll keep digging .
alfred , why did the wayne foundation stop funding boys ' homes in the city ?
there have to be some
yes . one or two .
which hospital ?
i have seen worse cartilage in knees . that 's good .
and not much of any use in your elbows or your shoulders .
thank you so much .
miss tate , isn 't it ?
the proceeds go to the big fat spread . it 's not about charity .
actually , this is my party , mr. wayne .
that 's very generous of you .
sometimes the investment doesn 't pay off
doesn 't spend half his fortune to save it .
have a good evening , mr. wayne
i felt ike some fresh air .
i have a powerful friend who deals with things like this .
yeah ? who are you pretending to be ?
who 's your date ?
she left her diamonds behind , though . worried they might get stolen .
you sound like you 're looking forward to it .
those pearls do look better on you than they did in my safe .
you . you scared her off !
must have lost my ticket .
my wife ?
don 't worry , master wayne .
bruce wayne , as i live and breathe
what are my options ?
can 't . i can 't , lucius
she has supported the project all the way .
show her the machine .
anything else ?
these conversations used to end with an unusual request .
mm-hm . well , let me show you some stuff anyway
oh , it was always shut down , officially .
for years , i 've been shuttering and consolidating
keep them from falling into the wrong hands .
rotors are configured to maneuver between buildings without recirculation .
oh , it has a long , uninteresting wayne enterprises designation .
and , yes , mr. wayne , it does come in black .
better mind ?
a less busy mind
hot bad
you should hear the rumors surrounding bane .
there is a prison in a more ancient part of the world .
sometimes the pit sends something back .
sorry .
let 's go . you , get in the car . they 've spotted the batman .
pull them in now . i 'm gonna do what jim gordon never could
are confirming four suspects are carrying two hostages .
reports from the eyewitnesses.scott , dead center of your screen
by what appears to be the batman .
sir , what about the armed robbers ?
one bike 's pulled off . no hostage . should we pursue ?
he 's getting away . who do you wanna catch ?
the entire upper west hill ..
eight years , and he has to pick tonight .
where 's bane ?
where is that masked ... ?
and he shall appear .
the plan is proceeding as expected .
do i look like i 'm running wayne enterprises right now ?
going around the city at 24 hours a day .
and he doesn 't have a cent to his name , anyway .
actually , they 're letting me keep the house .
my powerful friend might hope to change your mind about leaving .
by giving you what you want .
" us " you were excommunicated
and i 'm here to fulfill ra 's ai ghul 's destiny .
nothing held back .
your spirit
i 'm gonna need to see your ticket and identification , please .
i showed your picture to the congressman . guess what .
there is a reason why this prison is the worst hell on earth
has looked up to the light and imagined climbing to freedom .
so simple .
so as i terrorize gotham .
i will let them believe that they can survive ...
honestly , commissioner , i don 't know anything about civil engineering
no , you cannot .
if you move it , the core will decay in a matter of months .
and then it will go off !
hey . hey !
when ?
with a blast radius o / six miles .
only me .
thank you , good doctor !
and this bomb is mobile !
one day , you may face ..
your hands look plenty filthy to me , commissioner .
the rich !
and we give it back to you ..
gotham is yours !
but start by storming blackgate and freeing the oppressed !
step forward , those who would serve ...
the powerful will be ripped from their decadent nests
the mask holds the pain at bay .
e was born here ?
he fell in love with the warlord 's daughter .
when the warlord found out
well , it 's one of three . we 've been tracking it .
you don 't really think he 's coming back ?
actually , it does . you should put your faith in something a little more real .
and meanwhile , gotham lives under a warlord , like some failed state ?
you gonna tell him what 's really going on ?
there 's someone you need to meet .
what corporation ?
mr. fox , would you like to brief the captain ?
and as ceo of wayne enterprises , i have to take responsibility for it .
we built it .
someone sold us out .
t ' die before i talk

you don 't wear glasses in there and you seem totally fine with it .
i don 't think the pocket dial makes as much sense

ie looks like me .
ethan , you 're looking a little uncomfortable .
okay , so according to you ,
sometimes these things just happen .
i don 't buy it .
and it basically says that aberrations happen .
that 's so interesting .
it 's not that interesting
a minute later you flip that switch , the lights come on .
magic happened

what am i saying ? i look good everywhere .
i wonder if he 's here yet .
you could meet my pole any time .
you 're not my type .
wow , they have those automatic hand dryers that blow you .
those look like two giant orange traffic cones .
this is a lady .
sophie has new man in her life .
well , i 'm looking right at him and i don 't see straight either .
caroline , i 've written down address of drug store
unless it is cancer .
and , max , here is check for table seven .
how long is it gonna take to see a doctor ?
i 'm stage one pre-sick .
i told you before , you have to man up
i have actual things i feel .
this must be the orthodox jewish neighborhood .
max , have some respect .
they basically invented southern rock .
whenever i felt sick before ,
we 're not that different .
i was invited to many passover in their home .
rivka shemshelewitz .
so why don 't you just give dr. klein a call ?
i guess he doesn 't want anything to do with me anymore
guess not .
sounds like family to me .
finally .
i learned a lot of hebrew from mrs. klein .
what can i get you ladies ,
you know what , we could just tie our coats around our waists .
oh , and look at the breasts on this one .
no , bubala , i 'm just saving ,
here you go , esther rachael .
oh , doctor ?
oh , we 're still on that ride ?

stay and celebrate a little .
sit , eat , come .
good looks and funny . what a catch .

no way , this is a pasta and a dessert ?
my only son . my little angel .
girls , this is shmuley

say goodbye to the cupcake ladies .
did that just happen or has my fever suddenly spiked ?
yo , yo , yo !
yo , today my boy became a mans .
got my bar mitzvah done , son .
so let 's get to it .
max !
how about you turn around and make it pop for daddy ?
how is you gonna say anything with your mouth full ?
come in here , ma . this way .
let 's just get our money and get out of here .
you wanna ruin their day and not get paid ?
i want you to meet my mother , hinda fagel .
and i 'm caroline .
yeah , hi , i think i 'm that kind of girl .
i made sure every single one of those
i 'm so sorry ,
max , i told you how important
but none of that meant anything
your attendance implies it 's not .
oh , by the way , don 't forget ,
well , it sounds like the kind of thing one would bring up
oh , you know what ? i 'm not going .
it 's penny 's first time leading the pledge of allegiance .
whether we make the switch
you 're the only one who eats them !
i 'm not going ; you can 't make me .
what is the problem ?
well , why the hell did i memorize the pledge ?
oh , fine . we don 't have to have
yo , amy , just one second .
i mean , if it 's a boy ,
they 're so innocent and ..
totally , guys are the worst .
oh , good , go . you know , it 'll be nice to
in one case , it 's because they 've become involved
it 's bran !
leonard 's being a jerk , so we 're gonna watch over here ,
fine , i don 't want to watch with you either .
why do you get to pick ?
where 'd you get that from ?
ugh . amy , why did you tell him that ?
i don 't always defend sheldon .
what about your weird relationship with him ?
i 'm like the little girl in poltergeist
your infections are getting worse .
i didn 't have them before you two idiots operated .
again , i am sorry , but your lung cancer
when am i getting outta here ?
this is not guantanamo .
there is not much more that we can do
well , we 'll run some tests ,
well , it 's at a 0.8 now , and i 'd like it to be above a 2 .
it wasn 't your fault . it was a massive m.i .
is there a chance they could shut down the trial ?
i want to know why we didn 't see it coming .
yes , sir , but since she has had no contact with the baby ,
i mean , come on . i 'm all for mother / baby bonding ,
i thought you were a doctor .
oh , wait . i have , uh , patient 122 's trial packet .
oh , okay . one sec .
thank you .
you , too .
i 'm sorry . the place is , uh ...
that 's like kanye west trying to raise money for laying low. shvsash.com

i don 't need you to do any of that stuff . honestly .
that 's what you think . oh , my garland . this is delicious .
oh , well , then my christmas wish has been granted .
puffins , scatter !
noelle ! elf carol . daily carol .
guacamole ?
hi , helen .
hey , helen . we 're all out of bird food .
or a george foreman grill ?
are you sure ?
he really warmed up to you .
yeah . oh , steak knives .
my what ?
besides , you 're the one that told me to go .
you know how hard this has been ?
so it doesn 't matter that i 'm finally happy
oh , you better not pout , you better not cry .
you 're a coward who 's too afraid to be santa claus !
that 's what i 've been trying to tell you !
wait , where are you going ?
do you know what ? if i wasn 't so enlightened ,
she 's invited me over for christmas morning .
you 're gonna go , right ?
it 'll probably be awkward ,
dad ! the sleigh is amazing .
when are we gonna see noelle and polly again ?
polly ! that ..
but you 're gonna get your wish and spend
come on . thanks , guys . it was ...
oh , i hope their christmas works out .
worrying about someone else 's christmas and not your own .
thank you , polly .
what are you doing here ?
did you fly here all by yourself ?
you 're so brave . you must have picked up
oh . what have you got ? it 's from mother .
laugh .. mostly at you .
so , when polly came to see me
i believe that you believe .
and it turns out there 's nothing there
it 's just a tradition we 've been
oh , man !
ultimately , the one thing all santas share
what does christmas mean to you ?
how long have you been out in the field ?
i want to hear what you say .
i didn 't know you smoked .
right after i quit drinking
how do i feel ?
she asked a very good question .
well , that 's a question that needs to be asked .
we 're vulnerable to qualms of conscience like anyone else .
like everything else ,
i hate that it had to turn out this way .
we have a station for you to look after .
and one of the very few people who can process code at this level .
you keep the station safe , you keep the code safe .
okay .
i don 't wanna look like an ass for sticking my neck out on this one .
sorry . little last-minute broadcast come through .
wanna hear my latest theory ?
long-term tactical formations .
yhac ?
how was your weekend ? good

no , the codes change every shift .
where are they ?
we 're gonna walk . we 're gonna call for help . okay ?
blackleg miner station . go ahead .
requesting immediate evacuation .
yeah
ts all this blood normal ?
no way is a joke gonna make me feel more comfortable
looks like we missed the artery .
you could still bleed ou .
bite down . i think it 's starting to hurt .
that was bizarre .
yeah .
how long was i out ?
yeah .
you know as much as i do
they can 't blame us for anything
i am calm . but what are we gonna do next ?
'm fine . what do we do next ?
jet 's see what 's down there .
he only fired two shots .
oh , my god !
he knew there was a gun hidden down here .
there it is .
but they 've already sent the broadcasts .
they wanna kill us . make sure you don 't cancel the broadcasts .
used to what ?
they never seem to stay dead . how 's it going over there ?
i know , but can you open it ?
we don 't .
can you just talk to me ?
anything just regular stuff . like what normal people talk about .
how do you know i dropped out of college ?
grabbed my file or something ?
o what ?
well , i can 't work in silence , so you might as well just entertain me .
how about your profile ?
inability to communicate with any other
no . close .
restless . sense of self-entitlement .
stop .
this is my first station assignment .
looking at nine million black-book tax dollars .
said it was the best opportunity i 'd ever have .
well , you 're worth more than
all they 're really talking about is what 's real . reality .
i should have listened to myself .
nowhere ! where am i gonna go ?
and what have you got , huh ?
how could that possibly matter ?
what have you got ? you 've got nothing to live for except for this !
you 've got your protocol . you 've got your numbers .
and you read them and you take their money .
do you think you can fuck around with these people ?
will i die ?
need a doctor .
it 's a lot different than taking a piece of scrap out of your leg
this is gonna take the pain away for a while .
i 'm gonna wake up , right ?
please .
you ever play billiards , tom ?
says who ?
best billiard players , best horsemen , miners ...
a fritz machine gunner got a bead on us .

no , i 'm fine , honestly .
mr waddell .
isabel .
there 's something wrong with this bloody candle .
it 's not the candle , pull through . it 's the air .

oh , fuck , man .
courtesy of the northumberland fusiliers .

oh , yes , sir .
depends where you placed it , sir .
50 pounds .

clayton , you 'll have to cut a gap in the wire .
sir . sir !
word is that bastard won 't catch a train in case it 's going down a tunnel .

he said to say , " thanks for all your help . "
thanks , mate .

we 've undermined the whole of the messines
each mine has detonators and leads running to the surface .
no , no , no . no . fritz has got no idea .
top level 's mostly sand.clay starts around 30 feet .
where it finds a tunnel , it funnels down like a bloody creek .
if we lose even a few of those men ,
definitely . let us know how it goes .
fine . i 'll talk to susan .
as the mother of five ,
if 's bad enough she stole your husband ,
i 'm not gonna drag penny into the middle of this .
i think it 's time to fight dirty .
now some might say ,
i would die for him .
so while you 're opening your portfolios
portraits of children .

oh , thank you , bailey .
now is not the time , yang .
the chief has an emergency cardio situation .
yang
you spend every waking moment together .
you read each other 's minds .
yeah , but that 's just because they 're husband and work-wife .
the chief 's your work-husband
there 's nothing wrong with it.it 's like me and sloan .
nobody 's talking to you .
he 's ready for an angioplasty .
because you don 't remember how ?

am i the only one concerned here ?
i just wanted to have a nice , normal lunch together .
nothing 's normal .
has casey had any other medical issues ?
okay . can you sit up for me ?
yes .

the classic burger , the ranch house burger ,
they only have one burger .. the big boy .
excuse me , in a world that already includes a big boy
fine , l 'll have the barbecue burger .
oh , dear .
she didn 't take my order .
nevertheless , this will be reflected in her tip .
i mean , dopamine in our brains is released across synapses , causing pleasure .
well , who wouldn 't ?
that 's where you come in .
now because she 's crazy
got it ?
i know you know .
she walks away every time i try to talk to her ,
probably .
wait . you ... you think she 's hot ?
those eyes said , " you are meat . "
then he lunged , and i just reacted .
who the hell who does that ?
i 'm kinda wondering the same thing .
and there 's your arm .
i bet it 's nice to know what to expect
seems like something that ought to come up on a first date .
oh , yeah . you shoulda brought a bull whip .
then i insert them with the catheters
to drain the hearts of their existing cardiac cells
we are scrubbing away cells of hearts , cristina ,
and then in theory .
they 'll live again .
yes , you did .
any other questions ?
i mean , what do they even really talk about ?
i mean , plus , she has really thin hair ,
i will see you in pre-op .
alex uses his oil when tommy 's distressed .

well ...
so that was a little awkward .
almost seems like you guys were a thing .
oh , really ?
callie .
it 's not a big deal .
seems like something you would 've mentioned .
have you dated other people in the hospital
no , it 's totally fine .
not all of them . you don 't know about karev .
look , just give me a number . ballpark .
okay , that 's the nicu . i have to go .
i 'm sorry , but the babies , they need me , so ...
yep .
then there 's a lot of strong language .
i 'm fine . are we warmed ?
for what it 's worth , i think you 're doing the right thing .
she 's alone .
turn it off . please .
i see some bleeding .
oh , no one thinks that .
naomi does .
she knew i would 've freaked out .
and when i saw her profile , she seemed ...
maybe i misrepresented myself a little bit .
hang on . kirby was going for her
you were the knight on the white horse
i 'll tell you one thing ,
did you tell her yet ?
i went to look for your wife in the waiting room .
oh , no .
hey , don 't do that .
the ice isn 't cracking .
i mean , can you imagine the lawsuits
whoever did this is an artist .
but now the world 's gone soft .
so , we created a sport for people
our customers are some of the most powerful
more complicated rooms .
more ways to gamble on life and death .
there 's only one mr. white here
i said , sit down .
and you can wipe that smirk off your face ,
i 'm not a gangster , mr comer
i 'm looking for an employee who can handle the latter .
i 'm not looking for a bargain , mr comer ,

how you took on the whites .
that 's " um-up hr he bucks .

i don 't think he 'll like that , mr white .
what are you saying exactly ?
let 's say we 'll be having to turn
our money you mean .
without this , i 've got nothing .
just had other priorities .
it 's nothing that you ain 't used to , jack .
we 'll take it .
three ,
new bloke said he 'd never heard of you .
what do you want billy ?
met your wife and she said something interesting .
so how are you doing ?
i 'm feeling guilty ' cause i should have gotten him here sooner and ..
he 's gonna bounce right back .
you know what ? i am so happy that you guys came here . i really am .
you 're gonna lose it ?
i will be fine by myself . i am not a child .
i 'm fine . really .
let me shoulder the burden . it would be my pleasure .
you are not my mother .
i wish it were that easy , zachary ,
i haven 't heard back and i was getting a little concerned .
i thought the whole point of having a cell phone
mike , i need you to call me back . i mean it .
can you take those off ? there 's no way i 'm dressing him .
beating up a second gay guy looks bad .
so why did you change your mind ?
so if i 'm gonna get you out of this mess , you have to reciprocate .
doctor 's appointments , you 're driving . i won 't put a car seat in my maserati .
i don 't like the idea of this guy being around julie 2417 .
mike 's cool , dad . he cares about us a lot and i like having him around .
he 's still a plumber .
you honor , this whole mess is just a result of my loneliness .
after carlos was convicted ...
oh , no , i 'm talking about his other crime .
go ahead .
he knows how men look at me and ...
i ... falsely led him to believe i was having an affair .
i thought that maybe if he believed i was having an affair ...
i know it sounds stupid . i do . i just ...
my point is that carlos is an angry , jealous neanderthal .
she was just a sad girl with a lot of problems .
but you tell me what she ever could have done to deserve death
it 's so ... complicated .
you want some carrot , zachary ?
i 'd like you to meet irina .
i am finally to meet the lovely preston family .
um , preston didn 't say he was bringing a friend .
yes , preston scavo had returned from his trip

that young man is the first one here every morning
i think he 's tremendous .
a promotion to what ?
hey. check my stationery . i 'm vice president .
there 's plenty of work to go around .
because you had to be looking in a fashion magazine ,
oh , yeah .
it sounds like you guys saw everything .
well , uh , the first time i saw irina was on a beach in nice .
how do you say ? a gold digger .
yeah .
i know that look . he 's come to his senses .
okay . i don 't know that look at all .
but you 've only known each other for a few months .
oh , honey .
why : the feds don 't care about him .
oh , so that 's why you want to take him away .
if my kid shows up , he 's a direct link to me .
that was 18 years ago .
and he sure as hell does not care about my grandson !
i 'll tell danny you were here .
you had sex with robin the stripper ?

he had just met you and said he was in love .
we are attending my aunt flora 's 93rd birthday party .
she 'll be disappointed if we don 't show up .
she won 't be disappointed for very long .
i made a written record request 72 hours in advance .
i even contacted the centers for disease control to find out
amy , the relationship agreement was not designed
i use it to get the right way .
you gave me your word .
maybe she 'll dig it .
i can never find the tiller .
yeah , i always thought if i were ever enslaved ,
you 're right .
i should be able to figure this out .
then i thought if i did check with you first ,
you don 't have to check with me .
i guess i was hoping for a different reaction , but okay .
i don 't know ,
okay , i 'm an actress . ask me again .
wha .. the entire weekend ?
but li ..
i knew what i was getting into .
oh , my , is it getting hot in here ?

and when my foot soldiers start talking about shit like cuts
and in your case , padre ,

ambition leads to a word they don 't use much any more .
papa , what 's that ?
and i 'm brick .
i was there this morning .
when i saw you guys take out that whole house and walk out without a scratch ,
yeah . why didn 't you just go to the cops with this ?
and then there 's mcqueen . practically illiterate .
but he 's got a bit of an issue with authority .
that 's a mighty fine detective job you 've done , son .
so you do know the oodie brothers ?
i can 't just bring them boys in ' cause some suit from philadelphia wants me to .
the longer you stay down here , the more you 're going to realise ,
no , sheriff . listen , i 'm just asking for , you know , a little cooperation .
why don 't you let me worry about my county ?
i 'll drive us until i can 't drive no more .
i know , right ?
what if we get there and rob 's a baby ?
oh , that 's smart .
besides that , them bullet scars didn 't look too fresh on celeste 's belly .
what if there 's more than one kid ?

not scrubbing toilets .
you scared ?

i just want you to know that we 're going to do everything we can
my new lookout .

you know , i had the worst winter of my life ....
we 're getting too old .
somewhere in your contract is a bunch of words
bagging is when you drop the call .
tagging is when you claim that money .
like when they put the tag on the body at the morgue to identify it .
maybe you already bagged that dead body , right ?
but instead , you drag that heavy fucker
our workers do not sign contracts
we 're saving the economy .
it 's all highlighted in my book . i lay out the whole thing .
there 's no employment for many people .
these places are prisons ,
workers live in space efficient dwellings
lifetime contracts so no wages needed .
okay , but see i don 't know if i can ..
yeah , but what i 'm saying is i don 't know
hmm ?
you 'll be working here until late .
hey baby , what 's your sign ?

mtv spots worryfree edition .

for one hundred million dollars .
and after that , holla at your boy . okay ?
fuck . fuck . fuck . fuck .
keep my things , give them away .
yes , orson hodge was smiling again
had decided to kill himself .
everyone has a part to play .
others end up playing the victim .
but if the drama is to be really compelling ,
oh , look who 's here .
oh , i get it . i just don 't want to do it .
maybe now , but what will it
grandkids are the least of my concerns .
oh , not this guy again .

because i 'm the one that told her to quit .
i keep telling you how much i hate that shirt ,
we need to find her a job .
he 's a guy .
that 's it .
she said she always wanted to do something like that .
it 's not the hardest job in the world .
and there it is again .
you 're so sweet .
jeez , you scared the crap out of me .
don 't worry . i stuck him in the laundry room

and failing . i 'm sorry . it 's true .
okay . so you think this is about you ?
but it 's not about you , either .
you have to really be delicate .
and , uh , the act of me asking might be breaking them .
there was a complaint .
i thought it might be you .
i know , but it made me wonder
i didn 't .
oh , now that sounds like coercion .
i didn 't take it that way .
you 're not just saying that to curry favor ?
because you never have to do that .
you 're too good of a doctor for that .
i don 't know if i 'll even be a doctor in 10 years .
now , that 's coercion .
who cares ? i 'm doing an organ recovery .
i 'll basically be on general , cardiothoracic ,
oh , for hitting robbins with a gurney ?
yeah .
looks good .
guys , guys , guys , the knots are coming back .

that 's what the window is !
sometimes it 's longer .
save it . i know where i 'm not wanted .
i can 't waste the energy on that ,
no ! we are going to sit here in silence
for you .

gil got stuck in peru .
rough terrain . sliding down this hill ,
if it was anywhere near the tank .
we 're in a ravine at the edge of campus ,
no skid marks .
looks like he went clean over .
you know , i don 't think this explosion
here we go .
this looks like a detonator , ray .
lambert didn 't just drive into this ravine .
we got a point of explosion here .
killer waits for lambert to leave the party ,
let 's get the fragments over to trace ,
the last time we saw
yeah , well ,
i 've recovered a partial serial number
company that makes
shake alert .
what do you need with a deaf fire alarm ?
fine .
yeah , we 're fine . we 're fine .
yeah .
right before the explosion ,
you think it was the bomb ?
the bomb in dr. lambert 's car didn 't give us much ,
piece of a box .
you know , most ..
he 's julia 's t.a .
when i went to take julia 's statement just now ,
that means " sweet pea " in lsq .
well , you 're right , sean ,
but we didn 't give you a polygraph ,
during the test , we played a series of clicking sounds .
the spikes in your brain wave
you 're also a killer .
so he faked being deaf
well , sean lied about being deaf ,
something that no one on the campus would understand .
i didn 't realize how lonely i was .
and when we do ,
i 'm sorry , julia .
anything that might help us ?
but they shouldn 't be hard to get .
we leave tomorrow .
getting out of the cell block
that 's why i figured out the safest
the perimeter guards are less predictable ,
it 's the only way to avoid the jeep patrol .
that should prove some distraction inside .
looked like he turned away ,
no , but it is
if we 're going to get around these guys ,
there 's only one real road that goes to the prison .
what ?
you said a week .
you want it ? cause i 'll keep it .
we 're gonna have to watch both guards simultaneously .
keep track of everything he does and when he does it .
what will you be doing ?
go take a walk .

when this is all over , why don 't you do it ?
still , you can make it work .
he plays games , people get hurt .
but if he can 't fix it , it might be time
ladies and gentlemen , we 're out of order .

like , uh , ten tops ?
i 'll just , uh , grab a seat here .
henry .
they wanted to run a blood glucose test on me ,
and we don 't really need to talk about my bodily fluids .
oh , sorry . um , yeah .
are you , uh , are you a patient of teddy 's ?
anyway . i , um , i-i gotta go .
promise .
okay , 42-year-old male ,
pain doesn 't radiate . the e.k.g. looks clean .
but i don 't know .
because i know , sometimes that can happen
yes .
how good are you at forging signatures ?
it 's unethical and probably illegal . so i 'm sorry .
i 'll check on mr. richter right now . call radiology .
i mean , did you see that guy ?
i will not be taking care of children .
which way to butcher block ?
okay . i understand you might be thirsty , but i 'm sorry .
you 're wasting it !
yeah , she 's sending me off for another x-ray .
we 're gonna see if he 's eligible for the clot-busting medicine .
so-so on a scale of 1 to 10 ,
you will not believe this .
oh , damn it .
sorry to make you wait .
henry here has been keeping me company .
i 've been grilling him about the major leagues .
oh ... i didn 't know that he did .
although there is a baseball card out there with my face on it somewhere .
you probably have a-a reservation waiting .
wow . it didn 't hit any brain matter at all ?
how long till shepherd gets down here to take a look ?
good . longer that thing stays in there ,
or abscess formation .
how is he , grey ?
can i get some more gauze for this wound , please ?
i mean , he 's barely hanging on .
okay . i 'll get a room prepped and ready .
his aorta 's dissecting as we speak .
tell " em to bump mine and prep it for an emergency cardio .
got it . go .
let 's hold that elevator !
once these doors open , we 're gonna have to get him in the o.r ..
i know .
and we 're not gonna have time to scrub .
thanks .
it doesn 't need to be pretty . we need to get in there .
foley 's full of blood , too .
his cannula sites are oozing .
clear .
well , what can we do ? just tell me what to do ?
hey . i heard you lost a patient .
i mean , i don 't want to share you ,
it just seems like , if you agree to be
what the fuck did you just call me ?
22 years old .
it 's my fucking fault .
but you never once asked me what that was like for me .
you handpicked me because
look , you solve problems like no one else can .
i solve problems ...
exactly . now let 's get to work .
every surgery you do will go on your record ,
what did i miss ?
oh , how the mighty have fallen ?
... of the more complicated surgeries you 've scrubbed in .
i 'm getting to deliver babies .
yeah , you know what ? you 're making me gag .
just to drive me crazy .
at all times ?
you 're just as mean as he is .
which you can 't tell me
i know something else we can do instead .
why not ?
you 're just my wife .
look , there is a much safer solution to your problem .
no one will see your scar .
only fatties wear rash guards .
is something wrong with the device ?
grey .
bailey locked me out of my own mouse lab .
my surgery got pushed .
the butcher closes at 6 : 00 , right ?
why are you so not ?
yes .
please .
forget it . we 're closing him up .
yes . we need more time
which means i 'm free to go to the butcher .
i need to run an a1c on g .
we don 't need to run an aic on him .
on to what ?
i read the research ,
let me try .
i heard dr. shepherd came by .
i 'm sure he 's a great surgeon ,
i just had a baby .
at least today .
maybe it 's not the cells being rejected .
so we should check for signs of rejection ?
we 're looking in the wrong place .
how did you figure that out ?
so tell bailey to look for signs of rejection .
what , god , is that who you are ?
because either you 're god ,
dr. bailey !
hey , that kinda works .
see all those vessels blocking the way now ?
that 's why the tumor 's so smart .
hey , it 's my fifth year .
do you know why i picked you to be my co-surgeon ?
because you ...
but the surgeon i 've worked with the past three days ?
b-minus version of herself .
your whole career depends on it ,
i 'm sorry . what ?
you mind if i sit ?
yum !
i didn 't even drink the first one .
no , it did not .
i can literally do it standing on my head .
i barely got 10 hours of sleep last night .
thanks so much , pal . we appreciate it .
oh , ' cause he goes and gets things ?
i wonder that about people all the time .
i do it all the time .
yeah . here we go .
we just found the one thing you can 't make sexy .
i need a drink .

just so you know , bagwell 's coming with us .
he had something we needed .
fine .
did you tell him ?
scofield steps outside that tunnel , he 's a dead man .
we can invite sammy on the escape ..
which brings us to option number two .
would you ?
i felt sorry for the guy ,
norris ? he wouldn 't have made it through boot camp .
i see you 're making friends .
yeah. too bad .
you were right. we got
we 're supposed to be out of here in 48 hours .
look , i could have come up here and made something up
you know what ?
so , i 'll call you if anything comes up .
sit down .
the people i work for , they don 't like
half now and half when you 're done .
alex , come on !
i 'm gonna need a little help here !
i got it . i said i got it .
in the ring . 15 minutes .
yeah , that 's great. just don 't take too long to finish him off , okay ?
no games . i 'm in .
no , no , no. what 's wrong ?
no , that 's an impossibility .
there 's got to be more acetone around here .
if you don 't kill him , we are all dead .
i 've been in a lot worse .
why didn 't you tell me you were gonna buy a bomb ?
we need that saw .
i am . i 'm just maybe
yeah .
i have for years .
and , uh , well , with the money she was offering ,
yeah. and she 's

with this one act skynet will win .
we don 't even know if that 'll work .
before i go , tell me .
do you see the future ?
ok , then how do you know ?
sarah told me so much . she gave me signposts .
must been great .
it stops here .
that 's as much as sarah knew
but i do
once it 's uploaded from the servers .
we blow it , the hell , up ?
you think he 's dead , don 't you ?
anyway ...
time-travel makes my head hurt .
right .
i do not understand
he 's your mate .
did you ?
see ?
that sphere ..
this is proof of what i 've been talking about , for 30 ... whatever , years .
i need to see the suspects .
that 's what i thought . look we 're just heating this up for homeland .

downloading the second the counter hits zero .

my dad used to bring me here when i was little .
and i don 't know which one is worse
just look at what john has become .
what if that is what always happens if we 're together ?

mom , you did honestly think
the place you spent so much time with grandpa ?
the mother i remember would be proud
sarah connor , seat belt .
disrupt john connor 's magnetic coherence field .
theoretically .
i was able to infiltrate the work crews in this facility .
jntil i was laid of
only the magnetic quantum field is complete .
says here you 've been experiencing dizziness ,
i think unless you 've been poisoned
yeah . i remember this case when i was an intern .
turns out his wife was putting antifreeze in his oatmeal .
but eventually , it killed him .
but i feel like i deserve a second chance .
but you know private schools .
so ... if i were to win them over ..
oh , detective vance . i was just , um , heading out .
i just stopped by to give you another card ,
i gave it to you two days ago . you never called me ,
now , is that nice ?
once more and i 'm stalking you .
i 'm trying to .
maybe when you stop playing hard to want .
why pass up a chance to do it all night ?
fine . this thursday , 8 : 00 p.m .
is that a problem ?
antifreeze .
a friend of mine 's playing at a jazz club .
let 's see . you 're legendary for your cleaning abilities .
do you need any refreshments ?
thanks , but if we need any help ,
okay , uh ...
my family had a really crappy year .
but i was a damn good teacher when i was at this school .
i shouldn 't even look at this .
and besides , he 'll be here any minute .
you found something bad ?
oh , no . not for that .
i 'm just wondering when you were going to tell me
did your source happen to mention
say that again , and this time , listen for the irony .
you could have been dangerous ! i have to protect myself .
what 's up with that ?
you are treating me like a common criminal !
i will not be ordering . i want to go home now .
i don 't drink . wasn 't that in my file ?
what are you doing ?
i think you 're wasting your time ,
i wasn 't surprised . i was blindsided .
you 're right .
i just don 't think it 's gonna pan out for this summer .
bree , she needs to hear this .
then one day. she said , " i 'm better than this . "
you were really on the street ?
i don 't like to talk about that part of my life .
don 't mention it .
you said i had no chance , so i figured , what the hell .
yes , please .
what would happen
ahem . if you repeatedly consumed ethylene glycol ,
i can only imagine .
i thought i was borrowing lynette 's tent .
why are you setting up the tent ?
i figured if she spends the night camping out here ,
i wanted to know your secrets right away ,
when did dating become so complicated ?
we 've both had our hearts kicked around .
if " gun-shy " is the right word for a woman
i say ...
and just have a normal first date .
when ?
why not :
i 'd rather not say .
i mean , can you believe that dana gave me streamer duty ?
so tell me , how is paul ?
he thought he was having a heart attack ,
they think it 's stress ,
well , i think he should go back and have more tests done .
as a nurse , i saw time and again
well , yeah , i hope it cheers him up .
well .. i wishi could do more .
you 're doing more for paul than you can possibly know .
over a mile deep .
so that 's our vacation ?
now , now , kids , your mom worked hard on this . be kind .
did she say " scene " ?
i don 't care how i look .
first of all , a helmet wouldn 't keep him
second , there is no killer guy .
but i 'm still scared .
but you can 't let that scared come from inside your own head ,
it 's people walking by , juanita .
this is where you take charge of your fear .
no , it 's not , juanita .
oh ! who 's out there ? ! go away !
kinda did .
i just wanted to show you
it 's like the movie . it looks scary , but it 's fake .
i have to go . bob 's in the shower ,
luxury , nature .
or swimming in crystal-clear waters with the dolphins .
hawaii , hawaii , hawaii ...
you know who else
come on . there hasn 't been a shark attack
great whites tend to eat their victims .
this is very , very unlikely to happen .
i mean , especially if we all die first in ...
now you see
we await your verdict .
how ?
you say . " tom , when you start making the money ,
we 're supposed to be equal partners .
someone turned on a furnace !
no , no ! i 'm having the time of my life .
so what happened ?
bob and i have nothing in common .
" see the game last night ?
hey , pull my finger ! "
you 're right .
i should be forced to eat by myself ... in front of the game .
for god sakes ,
then shouldn 't we take him out for a nice meal
orchestra seats to .... " cats . "
when i found out he saw " annie " six times ,
do you like the opera ?
sorry .
hey , what can i say ?
well , duke 's got most of its starters coming back this year , so ...
bob , i get basketball tickets all the time .
and there is an upside . i 'd love to skip
this couldn 't have come at a worse time .
why do you say that ?
oh , i think that 's a plus .
oh , for god sake , the woman wants to be your nanny .
excuse me for not wanting to ruin one of my closest friendships .
go figure .
how could i say no ?
hi . i 'm dr. wagner .
she 's on maternity leave .
yes , so i see you 're here to talk about menopause .
in addition to being a gynecologist for 20 years ,
the way i look at it , we 've earned this .
i suppose .
see , i 'm recently divorced ,
what ? i hate to break it to bob ,
oh , that 's why he likes basketball .
and it wasn 't because of his dolphin tattoo .
bob isn 't going to " flip " carlos .
first , he takes them out drinking .
then , when their defenses are down , he flips ' em .
yeah , actually , sometimes literally .
sit down . i 'll open some wine .
i 'd rather get work done .
renee , that is not her job .
i don 't know what to do , mama .
and now he 's got a murderer moving into one of them .
i 've got an idea .
paul went to the store .
yeah .
can 't help but wonder what you boys are up to .
he 's keeping me in the dark for some reason .
you want to keep his confidence .
but , please .. i 'm just so worried .
what are you doing ?
what the hell ? i never hunt a woman in my life !
you 're a convicted felon .
i don 't like to be unpleasant , mr. yeager .
but i am going to find out what my husband is up to ,
we have to take the girls shoe shopping this weekend .
neither . i 'm going to rancho pines for the weekend .
yeah . bob invited me .
uh-huh . he got us a suite at the lodge .
i certainly wouldn 't want to do anything
oh , i really hope your parents like me .
i told them you were smart and beautiful
nothing . i didn 't tell them .
because you look so fantastic ..
but i don 't want them to think
bree ,
oh . me , i 'm retired from the army .
oh , a military man . you must have some fascinating stories .
guess what she does for a living .
she 's a doctor .
would you like to hear it ?
depends how drunk i am .
can i just thank you for keeping our country safe ?
or ...
i painted the characters from the knights of the round table
i 'm sorry . we haven 't been introduced .
uh , this is susan delfino .
well , susan , it 's a great idea .
you should show her your other sketches .
what the hell was that ?
i ... crossed the line .
yeah .
hey . what the hell was that about ?
did he ?
we should talk about that
look , i know about your history , bob .
ah . well , lee 's a fine one to talk .
okay , look , i don 't want to fight about this .
darling , i 'd prefer not to discuss that right now .
yeager already told me what you 're up to .
we had a nice long chat .
i must say , i was shocked ...
i 'm sorry i left the restaurant like that .
so why didn 't you tell me about the whole menopause thing ?
you really think i would care about something like that ?
more than i ever intended to .
what ?
that 's a big number . it means something .
it might .
so you can 't get pregnant .
you don 't like when i give them to you

i bought a tamagotchi in 1998 .
it 's still alive .
where 's howard ?
no " how are you . rai ? "
can you keep it between us ?
when i first got here , i thought you americans

you know what , it 's ... not a big deal .
she wants to protect her financial interests .
good . that 's a healthy attitude .
i 've got some rare comic books .
hope your hands are steady .
but this is just biology .
it 's not . i 'll have you know , in the field of physics ,

make it a great day .
i got the note , michael .
look , my name isn 't michael ,

like who shot jfk ?
okay , no problem . thanks .
yes . i 'm henry kishida .

my ace in the hole .

you make them love you so much that when they 're up against it ,
a cold , rational focus on winning .

according to the little you 've told me , he was different .

the city used to be beautiful , alive .
they 're putting up portraits of abu ramal .
god help us if he gets out .
and you come in here wanting help .

susan .
no ! no , nobody 's helping her with her bag .

chuck vance died last night .
hit by a car .
why are you getting mad ?
well , i 'm sorry if i 'm not all giggles and sunshine ,
not as big as mine . i helped bury a body .
our butcher beats up homeless guys ,
so man up or dump the guilt .
i know you 're right . uh .
and he deserved to die .
good . i 'm drawing a picture of lincoln 's assassination .
that 's a gun , and i think we 're done here .
especially with the way things have been between us lately .
it 's this whole chuck thing .
i 'm going to tell " ? sounds like a threat to me .
it doesn 't make any sense .
i mean , we know these people .
oh , god .

i 'll be totally supportive .
fine .
'cause last night you were suicidal ,
it 's been an interesting couple of days ,
i don 't believe you .
all you have to do is turn off the light
and since when are you a therapist ?
well , as impressive as those credentials are ,
now i 'm not leaving this room until you tell me why .
don 't worry about me . i 'm fine .
i don 't think you have any friends .
okay , that 's it . would you please get out of my house ?
i will not allow anyone to kill themselves ,
this is a funeral .

one minute you 're boarding a plane to paris ,
you will never know how helpful you 've been .

by the time things settled , he was gone .
that would be me .
i don 't have a mom for the rest of my life .
are gonna make up for that ?
and that left us all heartbroken and perplexed .
in those awful moments ,
you will always be the person who saved my life .
i realize that makes you the best friend i 'll ever have .
ooh , mario 's . that 's excellent .

there 's a lynette voodoo doll

ah . fine . got it . she 's terrific .
she would never criticize the pizza i brought over .
well , you had to point out that i didn 't get the thin crust .
i wasn 't sure i was gonna to make it .
and i just thought to myself , " sheldon ,
oh no , no , i 'm not going back in there .
he has literally been crying his entire life .
hey , man , i 'm in the weeds here .
uh , ladies , you 're late .
why , is he teething again ?
you were supposed to be here ten minutes ago .
there is no coffee prepped for your shift .
he 's the cook .
i 'm so excited .
our lives are about to get a lot more cappuccino-y .
no , you should not say any of that .
in all my three-ways ,
this girl got " you go grill " on her neck .
did you put yourself in a time-out ?
she 's not upstairs .
i was happy to walk into sears
i 'm doing it for the money we 'll make
puck from the real world ?
oh , here she is . i 'll do the talking .
and they 're the good ones , you know ,

well , han , actually , it 's pretty dangerous .
let him save the day .
my neck !
and that was my best feature .
you would 've burned your vagina .
caroline , i know this might not be a good time .

i promised you i would never do that .
i knew i was being set up .
at least , that 's what he thought .
you 're not .
we got it , sucre . get to crete .

what 's the navy gonna do about it ?
so , when i was a teenager ,
and all of them were named anthony .
ah , yeah .
probable internal head trauma on that side .
maybe he hit his head on the rocks ?
probably a pistol butt .
that means he was dead before he hit the water
or a body dump .
ambient temp 's 97 , water 's 107 ,
well , air unit didn 't see any other cars ,
how 'd he get out here ?
how 's it going ?
blood 's not human .
well , as soon as they develop
it 's got a right-slant loop , a core and a delta .
i 've been downloading
that 's my goat .
yeah , the left horn is damaged , just like the one i found .
hey , did you get latitude and longitude within the metadata ?
i was getting a little excited !
that 's right down the road from walter burns ' property .
and the nine millimeter
i 'll ask him when i get there .
all right .
i checked out the owner of this place , bill gibson .
his work card 's on file .
it 's not exactly a thriving enterprise .
what do you got , nick ?
but he could 've fixed it by now .
oh , and now you folks
you want to understand ?
i don 't see any evidence of
wasn 't there a river in ohio a long time ago
you know , i had a cousin who lived there .
gibson and burns tried to do something about it .
lots of sick people in cable springs .
yeah .
which is coming out when ?
and i 'm still missing one crucial piece of the puzzle .
sounds like a sci-fi expletive .
and then give me a call .
i 'm not gonna touch anything .
those the results from the water samples ?
hand ' em over .
the slides confirm walter burns
because maybe .. they were drinking bad water .
you see , it 's the same toxins ,
if these chemicals are in the water supply in cable springs ,
and tell them what ?
i found it .
they drill until they hit gas-bearing shale .
this creates miniature earthquakes
what happens to all the chemicals they put down the hole ?
well , have a look at this .
almost never happens without human intervention .
slow leak . tire goes down .
and that takes care of conservo 's only loose end .
firing one .
that 's some blood on the lanyard ring .
it 's the same color as walter burns ' hair .
so burns hopped the fence at conservo solutions ,
he drowned in that pool ,
which we confirmed by the blood we found in cody 's truck .
a conservo solutions trucker with no priors
he then takes a hit for the home team ?
thank you , gentlemen .
what ? seriously ?
no . they 're not telling you . i 'm telling you .
justice has been served .
for what ?
you don 't need a sample ,
but this has nothing to do with that show ,
they know us better than anyone .
we must be missing something .
think it 's a marital aid , do you ?
amy , how is this big glass shaft going to aid our marriage ?
hmm . haven 't really thought about it before .
relax , han .
in fact , they 're more likely to die
you think you 're too good for the diner ?
i think sourdough bread is too good for this diner .
hmm , let 's see . cupcakes ?
don 't go there , han .
why so moody . han ?
you know we have to bury those mitts now .
probably a 7-10 split .
it 's like when you go to the zoo ,
your ball came into our yard again .
uh , we 're role-playing .
hey . jay z ?
oh , yeah , baby .
he bought the brooklyn nets .
i 'm not surprised that you 're jay z and beyonce ,
oh , well , i 'll tell you what i told him .
so that 's basically our ball at this point .
crazy in love ?
i wouldn 't say that 's all we are .
we also share a cvs points reward card .
can 't you two ever do it over at oleg 's apartment ?
i have no idea where he lives .
no , with my busy work schedule ,
it 's more than just the place
i don 't have access to the pills i need
well , let 's see . we are kind of like a family here ,
and in my family ,
you know , what used to be known as good parenting .
come over tomorrow .
we can get-stoned and watch a movie .
well , those wiggle shows do get crazy .
yeah , and where is my homey ?
i can smell the axe body spray .
i brought shrek , shrek 2 ,
what are you guys doing here ?
you said she was going to be at oleg 's .
you guys live with oleg ?
as a wise person once told me ,
i don 't understand .
oh , i already did .
he fired me for missing 20 minutes of work .
let it go , han .
i didn 't fire you because you were late .
all right , well , apparently ,
okay , this is bad .
well , maybe we can get a replacement pig .
i started hanging out at circus bars until we met .
he was older , always in command of a room ,
he transformed me
no goodbye . no note .
i know it 's stupid .
she 's a fantastic mother .
he could never do better than that for a mother .
i think it 's time for them to travel .
that 's where my disappear bag was hanging !
you have to come back right now .
what ?
until then , just act normal
that 's going to attract attention .
me , obviously .
besides , you 're about to start your new life soon .
that 's something you like .
i 'd hire a nanny , sell the house , downsize to a condo .
sure , it 'll take me a bit longer to finish college ,
i 'm not letting anybody else raise him .
am i the only one unsettled
oh , we forgot to put the apple the new pig 's mouth .
now that 's your answer to everything , isn 't it ?
i was a fool to think i could get through this
i just had to protect myself .
pure , raw potential .
the innocent way your shirt cuffs
we haven 't heard from him since .
a reliable source told me where i can find him .
i 'm not going to call you .
get ruiz out of there
you know me , i have a gentle touch .
what 's up with the camazotz crap , huh ?
i miss you , man .
come on , buddy , let 's go .
okay .
what 's with the get-up , huh ?
to kill you !
you look good in purple .
it 's been a lot of fun .
what did they do to you ?
you 're a good agent !
you mean , we don 't all just deserve a little gentle horn shave
you always have been .
i think it 's a beautiful face .
i don 't know . those were ruiz 's last words .
does it ring any bells ?
missed one .
you 'll have to eat around the burnt bits .
if it weren 't for the dead , i never would 've found you .
we 're the line in the sand .
guys !
you know , maybe if humans weren 't so keen
there 's gotta be another way .
there 's gotta be a world where monsters
that is not what i want .
i want the forgotten people out of the dark !
that is what i want . give me an army like that
now , please tell me where the fuck they are !
the infection rate is much higher than initially ...
where 's gandalf ?
he said it was the only way to kill the blood queen .
i didn 't take the sword .
mr. lincoln , you are full of surprises .
dear abraham .
be careful , it can quickly disappear .
mom , is it okay , if michael comes to the yard sale ? "
i do like him .
yes , when michael took me to prom ,
a couple times .
his chest is very smooth .
i am glad you 're finally getting rid of that thing .
i was gonna meet you at your dad 's
you know , something farm or kelly clarkson-themed ?
i 've already done so much with that motif .
you know what ? no , sell ' em ! i wanna purge ,
and then when he puts the weight back on ,
where you think you 're going with those ?
hey , this is for charity .
you know they 're not getting the actual jeans , right , luke ?
20 bucks ?
sure . what 's it to youd
i don 't know . what 's the tag say ?
well , that 's why it 's lying on a blanket on my lawn ,
you 're wearing a $ 10,000 watch .
we think something 's stashed in the head .
mom , what 's the big deal ?

but i wanted to stand out ,
okay . never been so happy .

that pageant was one of the worst nights of my life .

i don 't want to do it ever again .
maybe there 's a part of you that wants to work through this ,
it 's going on 31 minutes .
i gotta get my leg free .
you know , alex , you and michael remind me so much
yeah . cutest girl in sunday school , too .
which was ironic because two weeks later ,
of course , she was devastated , just destroyed her .
how sad ?
he needs a little dose of reality .
i know how to push buttons to get what i want .
well , i can see stuff .
it 's not like i have another pair of pants .
it 's for a good cause .
oh , i doubt it . i bet we wear the same size .

i bought out all your debts .
she 's lovely .
i decided to send the first three chapters to my long-time publisher , imissy harter
she wouldn 't be able to resist .
what started out as reality fiction is becoming more and more unvarnished reality
if i can just get the balance right .
t 's the texas holdem of darts .
oh , nicky .
gun barrel in a holster ?
you can have the money if you don 't touch .
people kill for a lot of reasons .
pull it off and live .
if you know you 're going to die ,
you 've got to get that .
i know your secret .
and what is it ?
correction .
rememoer , i have to write it .
the single pill in the bottle .
that 's for the most painful condition of all .
hello , mate . mark .
shall we say 8 : 00 ?
sorry ?
the human being can formulate a strategy for death .
but then death moves in completely
she would be running things right up to the very last second .
happy birthday .
did mark write about you ?
he found a way to escape .
without being in the story .
she 's coming home with me .
fuck of .

it won 't let us leave .
what if we gave him a proper burial and all , like you said ?
the last page was missing .
find out where the remains are .
footsteps . i want to see where they go .
to be honest , it 's hard to know if s has any .
who knows ?
whatever she feels , it 's so far below the surface , no one can see it .
what ?
would you like to respond to what rex just said ?
i 'm sorry if i upset you .
of course .

we were sent to meet a dealer we were familiar with ,
why do you fucking shout ?
when he wasn 't there ,
we returned to the house .
we went to two locations we knew they were looking at .
it was over before we got there .
he 's got us driving on the day . that 's good .
something goes wrong , then what ?
make arrests when the responders get there .
we gotta work out that story too .
we made the first move we could .
we get to the meet-up . we take our share . they all scatter .
perhaps a strawberry .
blue for a boy .
number nine is not a starter home .
i didn 't know
it 's noah .
shem has ila , but she 's barren .
justice .
so we ourselves must be destroyed .
not when i look at my sons .

he sent us that indian marriage questionnaire .
okay .
no , i wouldn 't say not at all .
i do go to yoga , so ...
uh , " how close are you with your family ? "
how do you feel about children ?
i mean , if i saw one . i wouldn 't throw a rock at it .
i just said i wouldn 't .
so , yeah , we want kids .
right , like , in the next five years .
" how are you with pets ? "
totally . me , too . excuse me .
that looks delicious .
thank you .
yes , ma 'am .
u-unless you prefer " ma 'am . "
you seem more like a sweet thang .
well , if i was good at this ,
oh , yes , uh , you 're a concierge .
four , if i can get the current manager out of the way .
i-i get it . you know , um , i used to have a long list
that 's sandra bullock 's character in gravity .
i think i 'm nice . are you nice ?
every time a girl breaks up with me she always starts with ,
your favorite : in-n-out burger out of the wrapper on a plate .
i-i know it 's not a baby , but it does leak when you pick it up .
no , look , i 'm sorry .
you have no sense of time .
i assume your mission was a success ?
what happened to the ipad i gave you ?
you know paper 's the past .
are you reminiscing about the ludwig affair ?
about my retirement ? that 's why you 've come back .
now , max is a 14th level warlock , there 's nothing you can do . may as well relax .
thank you .
i don 't know that i can do $ 10,000 .

come on , kaulder . you must understand , anyone who would use this herb
max .
a whiff of garlic that was not garlic .
he 's the one ellic was working for .
every generation has to be given their chance to destroy the world .
you may look like us , but you 're not .
we were interrupted back in your bar .
i have to try again .
where everything i cared about burnt to the ground .
i 'm just making an observation .
i 'm leaving .
what is it that people know about us , anyway ?
salem was wrong ,
would it then have been okay ?
i would .
finally .
i hope i don 't look as rough as you do .
i killed the one who cursed you .
drink this .
the witch queen has returned .
but she just used me to save it for herself .
it was hubris to think that our secret wouldn 't be discovered by the enemy .
death .
we took all the most powerful witches that ever walked the earth
and they 've been waiting , waiting to be released .
we created the perfect coven .
you defeated her once . you can defeat her again .
you have to fight .
i never had a name for it .
i 'm coming , too .
no , our agreement was that if i helped you , you 'd keep me safe .
you know , i don 't care !
chloe .
it 's a plague tree . she 's here .
we haven 't much time .
kaulder , where are the prisoners ?
every witch i ever caught .
how ?
no witch would be strong enough to cast this spell alone .
so how do we stop them ?
i heard tomorrow is your last fight .
after i kill you , they will give me my freedom .
not while your arm 's still strong
and you spit in the eye of rome .
and you die a slave .
tomorrow , rome will make good on its promise .
she survived a year in rome without us .
in rome , i thought we had an understanding .
one for which i gave you no cause .
a beauty such as yours has no place
senator , i have no intention of returning to rome .
your wife ?
senator corvus , i believe you have mistaken me
a spirited refusal .
enjoy the remains of the vinalia , senator . good night .
bring this man . i need him .
come back !
if they catch you up here with me ...
there they are !
no . you go and leave me here .
senator , please . this slave saved my life .
lady cassia , you were unharmed ?
if i were to spare the life of this slave ,
i believe you understand the question , my dear .
well
who owns this slave ?
then i suggest you punish it and then remove it .
i don 't know what i was thinking .
he made me fee safe
he has caught the senator 's wrath .
i saw a look in that man 's eye tonight , ariadne .
only because i left rome before he could .
i hope she was worth it .
can you feel that ?
they have a plan for us all .
what do you mean ?
he 'll give the audience a good show
what are you saying ?
especially a death as glorious as his ?
because he knows that if he does not ,
if i were to marry you ..
if i marry you ,
with all of the benefits that that implies .
if you kill him now , on the tip of 100 roman arrows ,
to take home to your emperor a revolution ?
they will whisper it behind your back ,
i might become your wife , but you will never break me .
keep her there .
people of pompeii !
vulcan decrees that man to be the champion of pompeii !
great vulcan , we hear you speak and will obey !
you have to save cassia .
the villa .
i have to find her .
we have to get to the harbor and find a boat .
she risked her life for me , atticus .
i knew the gods would never catch you .
it 's time to go , my friend ... no .
then we have to go south into the hills .
this feels a little bit like that .
grabbing the gallbladder .
so this is the incentive .
there she is .
" i know i was helping you
what , you 're saying you don 't miss me ?
you seeing someone ?
he had a tumor removed from his pancreas three days ago ,
pretty amazing considering she fell 100 feet into a ravine .
jason paiz , 27
is he okay ?
laps . more . keep ' em coming . more .
can i make a suggestion ?
after you called last night , i did some research .
are you gonna be like this all day ?
i 've tried to avoid getting a new hip
sheila .
let 's see if we can stop this bleeding .
keep going . okay .
his vena cava is torn . you can let go .
he 's on his honeymoon .
dr. hunt , what do we do ?
dr. hunt , what 's your plan ?
if you don 't have a plan , then
it 's a long shot ,
do it pro bono .
oh , so we do nothing ?
well , you might as well do nothing .
but my hands are tied .
i have seen you bend the rules around here .
dr. altman , that 's enough .
cristina yang is fishing today .
i just want to do something good today .
i 'll .. set up a meeting with the review board .
look , they met with dr. miller three hours ago .
they 're not gonna call ' cause they 're idiots .
no , they 're gonna call .
yes , i am being stubborn .
i am stubbornly choosing to believe that
i 'm gonna lift the liver only enough for you
are you questioning my judgment or are you saying thank you ?
good . so ...
slow and steady . ready ?
now you residents , you come and go ,
what 's the emergency ?
a nurse hates me .
i 'm sure all the nurses hate you .
i think you love me .
can you please just talk to him ,
but you gotta meet me at joe 's tonight for a drink .
that 's why you love me , ' cause i 'm unbelievable .
i know . i dig it .
seahawks , sunday , box seats .
of course .
unless dr. bailey herself orders that drain put back in ,
mm-hmm . i understand .
yeah .
what ? ! that 's it . you didn 't do anything .
you 're going out with sloan tonight ?
well , there might be a medical emergency
you are fishing . whoa !
you 're good .
stark ? please . you don 't need stark .
in a year , everyone 's gonna want this surgery ...
unless ... i create another me .
the paramedics will bring mr. burton here ,
so you 're sending him home to die ,
see , uh , eli took out a drain when he wasn 't supposed to ,
we 're just focusing on getting jason through the night .
i 'm afraid to touch him .
hey , there 's my star resident .
oh , dude . sorry , i can 't .
stark ended up hating the guy
dr. webber slipped me some free samples ,
well , good luck .
way to kick a guy when he 's down .

or ice dancing .
a surfer here ?
i 'm with max , the only waves we get in brooklyn

i hope he texts me . i love surfing .
when i used to summer in st. barths ,
caroline , if you 're looking for that kind of guy ,
oh , sweet . no thanks .
you 'll be at the front row of every concert ,
what ? i love music , and if he bugs me ,
and he thinks he can get us into the hot , new spot ,
good night , broke-ass divas .
yeah , and then i ate it .
i don 't want to have him take me home
stay out all night with the surfer .
that 's not surfboard , that 's snowboard .
what do you think ? these things on full display ?
i did not get stood up . i 've never been stood up .
am i being stood up ?
i once waited three days for a guy .
okay , fine .
so i 'll just sit here and text while we wait ..

because dr. quinn , i need some medicine , woman .
oh , my god , no way !

we 've lost one of our satellites .
what 's going on ?

and all of those stories are right here .
some are actually true .
mayo ! i love mayo .
el chupacabras , the legendary goat sucker ?
there is one thing that we know for certain .
and long ago , in the center of mexico ..
churros ! churros !

he land of the remembered
the sad and lonely destination for those poor souls .
but before i can properly begin our story .

i saw how u fought that beast .
maria and every girl in town .
but i want to be a musician . fo . you must focus

i 'm gonna miss u guys .
for as long as it takes .
and u .
i got u a present . you should probably open it now .
e don 't have to kill the bull !
manolo .
i 'm sorry , papa .
a sanchez man never apologizes ! never !
yeah ! you better run away !
perhaps now ...
maria , please , do it for the town .
and did ul see that mustache ?
maria is doing this to protect the town .
life can be really tough for the living
oh , my sweet child , this is not the end .
you 're going to be a little disoriented at first .
let 's start with ur name . maria posada !
it 's luis " el super macho " sanchez !
one bull is for cowards !
manolo ? i 'm so happy to see u .
a sanchez !
hey ! good luck , little sanchez !

my son did not deserve this .
it 's only fair .
you gave me the medal .

and so , joaquin learned that to be a true hero .
there is one more thing we need to do ..
wait . let me see .
we 're so proud of you .
so , ramona , beatrice has her report card .
that old thing ?
that 's a good place for it .
" ramona is a bright young student "
she can 't tell kids not to invent words .
you butt out , beezus .
you need to listen to her .
she was fair with me when i was your age .
honey , i 'm sorry we laughed .
guts !
hi , aunt bea .
where 's the love ? honk , honk .
that was a fine job you did on the toothpaste .
you realize we 're gonna be poor now , right ?

and dad , he ' be with us .
well , get ready for another year in hand-me-down heaven .
she claims it affects the taste

h-a-b-i-t-a-t .
and give it a little extra .
yeah !
well , thank you , mrs. meacham .
what ?
oh . yeah ?
and climb gigantic ladders .
you would get to put your fire suit on over your pajamas .
it 's true , dad . i took a field trip .
i think you can do anything , don 't you ?
hi ! i 'm home !
i 've heard those parent-teacher meetings can be really boring .
nice try , ramona . we 're going .
honey , i wanna call the bank tomorrow and cancel the loan .
i don 't think we have much choice .
we just have to finish it .
i 'd rather sell it than let the bank take the house .
our house .
okay , fine .
this is our house . we belong here .
ramona , i am on the phone .
can i , can i ask you something ?
what 's wrong ?
oh . you mean hobart . hmm .
he said he wants to catch up with you .
he said that to you ?
aunt bea , can i ask you something ?
aunt bea ?
oh . i 'm sorry .
no . go away .
but .. what did i do that was so bad ?
if i didn 't know better ,
is he still out there ?
oh , look at him .
and just reel me back in again .
yeah .
you 're doing good .
that jeep of mine could sure use a wash , don 't you think ?
how much to hose her off ?
fifty d ... no . no , no , no .
that jeep is my pride and joy .
really ?
one hundred dollars ?
oh , just , uh , one little condition .
yeah , we can sit inside , like the old car washes .
like i said , it 'd be nice to catch up .
how fast can you wash his car ?
so i can just sneak right up on those polar bears .
well , i ' m-i ' m glad you like it ?
you 're not gonna leave it like that .
what do you think , bea ?
sure .
next time we clean the neighbor 's garage ...
for your records , my dear .
and i started with zero .
like being a good helper , getting along with your sisters .
don 't worry about a thing . i 'll do it .
that 's my girl .
here comes the ... intergalactic space lava .
she doesn 't know what intergalactic space lava is .
how your mom kept things running so smooth beats me .
have you decided who 's gonna get it for sure ?
okay , let me think about it , ' cause i like your persistence .
wow . you are definitely dazzling , pickle .
bye , dad .
so i 'm gonna take this ...
whoa . you look fancy , susan .
she 's in real estate , so she knows a little something about presentation .
ramona !
sorry . i 'm just enjoying my new room .
i 'm not gloating . i 'm bouncing .
anything left over goes to goodwill .
stop !
give it back .
uh . that 's far enough .
mind where you 're digging .
oh , is that what i keep hitting ?
good talk .
maybe he 's digging a secret tunnel to istanbul .
or maybe this house was built on an old burial ground ...
open call ? that means anybody can audition , right ?
a million dollars . take out your instruments . good .
i see .
you and your father are breaking new ground together .
come on !
try this one . okay. no , no . that 's no good .
how 'd the interview go today , daddy ?
but there 's other jobs out there .
just me and you . what would you like to do ? think big .
yeah .
and have one foot in oregon and one in washington .
i like it .
cool .
when we were kids , i thought your dad was , like ,
when he made us set up the tents and wait there all night ..
you ended up with mashed bananas in your hair .
yeah , well , he 's not as funny these days .
he lost his job a few weeks ago ...
and he should be .
what if he has to settle for something that he hates ...
it 's not that i don 't want to talk to you ..
it 's just very different .
exactly .
thank you .
yeah . it 's good to know some things never change .
mrs. meacham gave me a do-over .
sorry .
oh . yes , well , that 's one way of putting it .
i got a two-hour drive to get to this interview .
you have her number at the office if there 's a problem .
how come she ' s always in charge ?
imagine what you 'd do to our house .
bye !
it 's worth a shot .
i 'm not sure if beezus is available .
go away , you jerk !
no , not you , henry !
you will never change , will you ? .
but you will always be a little pest !
stop touching everything !
including my love life .
just feed the cat and leave me alone !
okay . i 'm gonna hang up now .
don 't worry . mom will be home soon . she ' know what to do .
we can 't make any trouble for mom now .
he was a quimby before we were , beezus .
sure . but what about a church or food ...
you can use mine . you always said you liked it .
yeah ! see ? i like that idea .
i ' m nine years old . i think i can tell when i 'm not wanted .
ramona , don 't be silly . you 're not gonna run away .
well , i 'm sorry to hear that .
i mean , just in case people start asking
okay . now , i 've added your dad 's old sweater .
it 's a little big on you now , but you ' eventually grow into it .
that 's my girl .
okay ?
there you go .
honey , thank you for this .
no problem .
okay ?
i am just going to , um , check the focus .
lynette .
ian hainsworth had been miserable
then one day , he met susan mayer ,
and ian was loving this company ...
two ..
do the nurses know you do this ?
um , you weren 't supposed to see that .
i want my kid lynette .
kayla !
what is going on ?
we can just have fun .
lynette .
i 'm just thinking of kayla .
why else do you think i 'm willing to put up with all this for six months ?
" yes , that 's my husband 's love child and her mother in our christmas picture " ?
you always come first with me .
i guess i 'll see you later , nora .
i 'm taking kayla .
because if it 's not , i won 't .
just wake up and tell me .
i 'll see you tomorrow .
i 'll keep an eye on him .
yes , sir
where do you think you 're going ?
what about that dog of yours ?
i want you to remember something
dutch day is coming up , and i don 't need any trouble .
if mr. whiskers dreams about you ,
you can keep it .
hey , boy . how are you doing ?
you 'll be my partner , right , victor ?
you know the most about science so pick me as a partner .
we can make a death ray !
exactly
they both get what they want because they compromise .
i 'd like you to try a sport . say , i don 't know , baseball .
how do you choose ? guess what ? you don 't have to .
you meet in the middle . everyone 's happy .
victor .
what is it ?
maybe it just hopped out . did you have the lid on it ?
i mean , it was there when i went to bed
no ! sparky !
don 't worry . i can fix that , too .
are you sure this is going to work ?
do we have to collect it on me ?
science .
so i can 't sit idly while a teacher endangers our children .
she 's right ! he 's crazy !
apparently pluto isn 't good enough to be a planet any more .
this guy comes along and rewrites the rules !
mr. mayor , edward frankenstein .
i just would like to say that our son victor
my cynthia has been asking
please come up , mr. menace .
i think the confusion here is that you are all very ignorant .
even my plumber wins nobel prize .
always needs more .
nobody likes scientists .
not the questions that science asks .
people think science is here , but it is also here .
yes .
no . i just wanted it over .
i was doing it for the wrong reason .
but it can be used both ways .
no , he doesn 't . you fell for a parlor trick
it was , and it was dead , too .
no , victor did .
rise from your tomb !
sparky ?
i thought that you were gone .
promise you 'll never go running off , okay ?
was someone else here ?
did you see those things ?
you know how on the package , they 're like ,
i thought you had a morning class .
what ?
danny , our family 's been in this country five generations .
okay , what 's going on ?
no one talks to me at school , no one sits near me .
call in sick .
we could call it a boob day .
so i waited around all morning , carlos , for that repairman that you told me to call ,
mints ?
yeah , we found a whole box of them under ana 's bed .
can i have one before dinner ?
what happened here ?
okay .
whose name ?
she doesn 't use his name .
you were spying on me ?
okay , you saw me .
susan went to bed early , and mike watched a ball game .
that sounds exactly like a marriage .
through a window !
they 've got a $ 200 million pension fund they 're looking for somebody to run .
just listen .
and then they leave the money on the dresser , right ?
i didn 't understand it then .
ana ....
and sometimes when i 'm having a rough day ,
look , ana , l love your uncle carlos , and we have a wonderful life together .
i don 't see dad being careful .
danny , listen to me .
you father took real good care of me .
he 's a good man.don 't you forget that .
you may not be brilliant ,
i tried to wait up , but today was just too much .
well , the repairman finally showed up ,
can i help you with that ?
you 're supposed to be on sick leave .
really .
i don 't want to fight .
i 've lost so much these past few weeks .
it 's all i have left , and i can 't lose those .
so ... are we friends again ?
i 've just been worried about you , that 's all .
look , it was definitely big enough , okay ?
i appreciate you saving sophie , jay .
mom ?
time to wake up , jay .
you look awesome .
so , i 'm coming home at 12 : 00 and we are going to get school supplies .
well , i seem to be missing parts on the bottom of my board .
f ins , fins , fins .
they call that thing a gun .
want to take that drop .
why not ?
i can handle it
you don 't just do it .
you have any idea how much strength and know-how you need
yeah .
ftow resist me
frosty .
deep breaths , steady rhythm . drive and glide .
come here , sophie .
can you sign me a permission slip with my mom 's signature on it ?
heh . a permission slip ? for what ?
okay , promise .
maybe the biggest wave in the world .
efrosty 's gonna train me to surf it .
does it look like it
you got to stretch out those lungs .
if you can 't hold your breath
where 'd you find that ?
god , you 're so beautiful .
i get it .
and i 'm serious this time .
i promise .
mom , you got to get up right now !
you 're gonna lose your job again ! mom !
mom , get up ! come on !
you 're 11 minutes late .

you can never come into the out , ever again !
you are just having to take away the piece of wood .

we could create an alternate reality with no gorg in it
how long would that take ?
based on our current technology ..
lo imillion years .
that 's a lot of years , toni . moving on !
yes !
next !
and cancelled his e-vite
so the gorg never receive it !
it should to hover much better now .

driver gets to pick .
involuntary physical response .
if you want humans to not hate you ...
confusion . what is happening to my body ?
i can tell . but you 're getting the hang of it !

not yours . mine .
how would you feel if some horrible aliens took your mother from you ?
more important than others .
but recent moments ago , you are kicking on me and yelling .

humans are more complicated than it said in the pamphlet .
and that is why we keep running away .
because they are gorg .
like , if you has a sandwich .
oh , that 's enough !
it is never too late to run away . that is the boov motto .

what if i could fix that ?
first , a little beauty mark .
not yet . give me that mirror .

i has confusion .
but maybe captain smek is right .
probably .
nobody 's perfect .
that is not what makes you boov .
that the humans were just like the animals ...
teach to them .
it is what we thought .
that we were thinking wrong .
i am thinking the boov should never have come to smekland .
so i am saying the sorry to you ...
call me tip .
i tried to make friends at school .
yeah , i did .
they were not happy to see me .
i fit out .
so we could move and things would be better for us .
in a way that we boov do not even care about each other .
and i 've done very little to earn that .
... but not in the ways that i now thinks are most important .
i have had enough . shush !

where was the breach ?
compartments five and seven have been compromised .

i was a lawyer . prosecutor .
this man thought about that promise every day for three years ,
everything
i understand . i have a daughter .
you can die in here ,
we 've got 24 hours before hobbes realizes
they 've given permission for your midnight prayer ,
what are we up to ?
not for this .
what do you mean ?
you should be up there ,
you just happened to be in the same cell when he got here .
i 've done a lot of work on this thing .
we 're just the labourers on this thing , man .
cos that 's all we are .
or does he keep it all to himself ?
you don 't know what you 're talking about .
if he tells you everything , then you don 't need him .
or , you know , you can wait , and see
she told me all about it .
what do you call a girl who married a felon to get into the united states ?
no strip clubs in whazitstan ?
i 've a schedule to maintain .
i was just asking mr scofield about the contraband
he 's had it out for me since the day i got here .
i saw you coming out of the conjugal room .
you don 't have to explain it to me , michael .

records from the phone in the yard . james bagwell lives down in gary .
yeah .
tell him you 're having my son . we 'll be a family .
and it 's even harder if i do this by myself .
i 'm really scared to do this alone .
well , i haven 't told him no yet .
you 're not actually considering this ?
they 're poisoning your brain .
this is our child we 're talking about .
i want you to wait .
sooner than you think .
all right . visiting time is up . let 's go .
hands off , sucre .
i love you .
tell me you 're gonna tell him no , honey .
nothing .
when are we getting out of here , exactly ?
as soon as possible .
why does he need to know and i don 't ?
why would you want to be responsible for potentially dangerous information ?
it 's for your own good .
stealing from a guard .
maybe even add a few years to your bit .
no , don 't deny it . i already know it 's true .
uh , that 's implied .
checking the kidneys to make sure
thought you were off work today .
okay , you need to tie that off better , though .
the flip 's a critical part . you ready ?
you want this baby to bleed out ?
look , i know this procedure is her baby ,
don 't let her do that to you .
good , because if this flip goes wrong ,
except it 's not a car or a battery .
so .. it 's a bad analogy . i 'm sorry .
but if the flip goes wrong , then ...
is hosed .
i mean , they 've got it down .
no , you over me .
mine over yours , babies in the morgue .
okay , but let me get this straight .
oh , don 't use that kind of language with me .
i have to go . teddy .
you need a break , and she does , too .
okay . i am now prepared
oh , could be two ,
but i may have to throw in a third .
i 'm glad i skipped the conjoined twins .
so i proceeded with the laser endoscopy
i had good visualization of the tumor almost immediately .
he had clots , which were blocking my scope .
however , henry 's hemorrhaging was severe ...
kepner , suction .
henry 's hemorrhaging was so severe
blood was coming out of the e.t. tube .
we cracked his chest and tried to get to the source .
and then thanks to the unhealthy level
for the record , my life is pretty great right now .
dr. grey .
who 's the last person you see before you fall asleep at night ?
the last person you see before you fall asleep at night .
must be nice ,
thank god .
making sure that they each have good blood supply .
that 's next .
is there a bar around here ?
he 's not a total drunk
it 's a good one , with benefits .
it 's what everybody thinks .
you 're probably placing bets in the or .
well , you can tell everyone in that room
we 're staying together
i wasn 't judging you .
i was thinking
so we 'll give her all the colon then ?
check the function of the blood supply to the kidney .
that 's what i want to talk to you about .
we practiced that flip before ,
get to your point , karev .
we gotta be the perfect team .
she 's making everybody uncomfortable .
who wants to replace karev on the flip ?
uh , i 'll do it . sir .
he was under anesthesia ,
dr. bailey , op notes done .
he 's gonna be here 30 minutes from now .
you 're going to try and get a sandwich
dr. grey .
for god 's sake .
look , what we have is good .
because we 're not kids anymore .
and i want to share it ,
now look , we just got back together two weeks ago .
excuse me . excuse me . excuse me .
seriously , look at this face .
they 're in the spinal cord now .
oh , zola , look . there 's your daddy .
39 . nope . the x-rays are here .
dr. bailey , we have to close .
you have boards coming up .
well , don 't just stand there like a whipped puppy .
when a man 's life is at stake .
on the ...
focus
there 's a kink in the vessels .
hey , why are you doing this and not karev ?
i picked karev 's pocket .
twice in one day , karev ?
it was like taking candy from a baby .
it 's not fair to the baby .
at least the baby puts up a bit of a fight .
yes ! oh , we got it .
the kidney 's working . we did it .
dr. webber exercised his judgment and stepped in .
unless you think that 's a forfeit .
you 're bored already , and we 've been at it 30 seconds .
i like hanging out with tuck .
i .. want the whole package .
i know that .
so that 's it ?
my toothbrush is in my locker .
so that went well today .
