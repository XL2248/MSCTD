# MSCTD Processed Data

## bpe_ende/bpe_zhen
The two folders `bpe_ende/bpe_zhen` contains training/dev/test sets after bpe processing.

The script `build_sub_dialog_ende.py` in bpe_ende or `build_sub_dialog.py` in bpe_zhen aims to generate subdialog with context length 3.
For example, you can run this as follows (train/dev/test):
```
cd ./bpe_ende
python build_sub_dialog_ende.py train
cd ./bpe_zhen
python build_sub_dialog.py test
```

## ende/deen/enzh/zhen
The four folders `ende/deen/enzh/zhen` contains training/dev/test sets with corresponding dialogue context, which is generated by running the `split_*.py` script of different folders (* means enzh/ende). 
For example, you can run this as follows (train/dev/test):
```
cd ./ende
python split_ende.py train
```
## Image features
Following this [proceder](https://github.com/ShannonAI/OpenViDial/blob/main/video_dialogue_model/extract_features/extract_features.md), the coarse features extracted by ResNet50 can be downloaded here [CSV features](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GExHEXCHrImR9EhROP7yzIsG00jBXrCu/view?usp=sharing).

Similarly, following [OpenViDial](https://github.com/ShannonAI/OpenViDial/blob/main/video_dialogue_model/extract_features/extract_features.md), the Fine-grained Object-based Visual features extracted by Faster R-CNN can be downleaded here [FOV features](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DCdIgBnEJegJnFxL5LPO_PpMtXbNxoIs/view?usp=sharing).
