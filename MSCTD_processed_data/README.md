## bpe_ende/bpe_zhen
The two folders `bpe_ende/bpe_zhen` contains training/dev/test sets after bpe processing.

The script "build_sub_dialog_ende.py in bpe_ende" or "build_sub_dialog.py in bpe_zhen" aims to generate subdialog with context length 3.
For example, you can run this as follows (train/dev/test):
```
python build_sub_dialog_ende.py train
python build_sub_dialog.py test
```

## ende/deen/enzh/zhen
The four folders `ende/deen/enzh/zhen` contains training/dev/test sets with corresponding dialogue context, which is generated by running the split_*.py script of different folders (* means enzh/ende). 
For example, you can run this as follows (train/dev/test):
```
cd ./ende
python split_ende.py train
```
