but , for now , it 's done .
you 're on ad@@ min leave until they make a determination on the battery ...
everybody from chief so@@ to to the fbi to the whole god@@ damn world
what do you mean ?
just something i saw on oil projects in saudi .
rather than guard every project ,
hang on , what ?
they had built-in acceler@@ ometers
when it got in range of a cell tower , it would start ph@@ oning home .
this looks a lot like the same thing .
did the hunters put a cel@@ l-@@ based tr@@ acker
uh ... . i don 't know . the wife might 've done .
he@@ y. listen , can you check with a cell phone company ,
yeah , all right , call me back .
are they gonna run it down ?
hopefully . i 'm not allowed near it for now .
but , christ , jenny , that 's amazing .
have you named him yet ?
well , if he had a name , he 'd be mine .
what is it ?
hey . hey , wake up .
wake up .
shit .
the last few hits have been near c@@ alu@@ met .
it must be far from the tower
takes in half the storage areas south of the city .
nobody 's got the manpower to search that many storage yards .
and with the at@@ f on the fire and kun@@ z 's un@@ determined call ,
look , to hell with downtown and the fe@@ ds .
orders or not ,
we 're here to help you finish this , sean .
there 's something i gotta do first .
thanks .
a cat fall on your head ?
did you bring the sugar ?
no , i didn 't bring you sugar .
i just came here for one thing .
you 're so mean .
i 'm sorry about your uncle brian .
sean , no !
no ! i have a reputation .
i just talked to them about the dragon .
okay , so how were they gonna
package ?
why would they talk to me about that ?
because the language of these people is fire , right ?
oh . they don 't speak the language of fire .
not like we do .
yeah , you and i don 't speak the same language .
oh , come on , sean . of course we do .
you love to speak with the dragon . so do i .
and the dragon loves to speak with us , and you know it .
you would be seeing another you .
hi , another me .
all right , look , just level with me .
how are they getting the package out of chicago ?
i don 't know anything about a package .
nothing . okay ?
but i will share a story with you ,
god damn it .
listen to me , you son of a bitch ,
all right . what story ?
two guys walk into a building , one walks out .
so , i grabbed a garden@@ er 's can of mixed fuel ,
but enough that both fires turned on each other , away from the building
done .
and yet wic@@ ek was still consumed .
yeah . he was .
so here 's my question .
what did you feel when wic@@ ek caught fire ?
did you want him to burn ?
did you want to burn them all ?
you have no idea .
oh . oh , believe me .
i do .
i do . i do . sean .
those two men with the pretend names ,
okay . what location ?
given the kel@@ vin required for ignition was minimal .
given the constraint of mixed fuel .
that 's what the man said .
ah . oh , you 'll need to find a battery for it , and i was never here .
thank you .
just keep those dead kids off my desk , huh ?
shipping to nigeria ?
there you are .
a lot of people looking for you .
come on , come on , come on .
what the hell are you doing . sean ?
surprise , surprise . no diversion blast today .
they 're not just gonna let us drive through with the god@@ damn load .
hey ! show me your hands ! show me your fucking hands !
now , get out the fucking truck . go ! move !
come on ! show me your fucking hands .
walk towards me slowly . slowly .
keep coming . walk towards me . walk towards me !

ye@@ p . you 're up for car@@ pool .

mom doesn 't see human patients .

um , tam@@ my 's mom believes that fal@@ con crest is a real place .
let 's just stick to science , okay ?
facts only .
we do have vi@@ als of hiv ,
actually hard to contract .
you 've seen something worse ?
jason , don 't worry about what you 're seeing on tv .
i work in one of the saf@@ est places in the world .

hey .

ah , what do we have here ?
who would drop a package off looking like that ?
haz@@ leton .
those research monkey guys ?
ye@@ p . well , hello , monkey 0@@ 53 .
wow . it just gets better .
it looks like a spleen .
let 's see what brought you in here today .
what 's wrong ?
it 's not just a spleen , it 's ...
uh , a blood clo@@ t , i think .
i 'm gu@@ essing from sub@@ cutaneous hemor@@ rh@@ aging .
what would cause that ?
the virus , a powerful one .
and , if this is a pri@@ mate , it 's probably sh@@ f .
uh , sorry . peter 's the virus guy .
si@@ mian hemor@@ r@@ hag@@ ic fever .
highly contagious .
where ever this guy came from ,
oh , you 're safe .
it ri@@ ps the hell out of the inside of monkeys ,
we 'll make a few cultures , see what 's going on .
if this monkey has si@@ mian fever , you 're looking for
dead monkeys make me sad .
i never know how to deci@@ pher your level of sar@@ cas@@ m .
well , i guess i 'd put us at a ..
kind of like a level 3 ?
not really the pu@@ n type , ja@@ hr@@ ling .
stick with ac@@ erb@@ ic .
rome@@ o , bravo , lima , fort .
code three . medical tear , lock two .
ma 'am , are you all right ?
whatever it is , it didn 't get me .
just check the glove .
the cut was there before , but i ..
i 'm observing blood in the powder .
what the hell were you thinking ?
sir , we have a duty to warn haz@@ leton .
why 'd you go in there with a cut ?
i don 't even know where to start .
you can get as angry as you want at me later ,
no , because i was using a fresh sample .
well , there you go .
i mean , how can you be 100 % sure ?
i already have the lab
colonel , weeks ago , i asked haz@@ leton to send me samples
the package was for my study .
the cells blew up because they were infected .
i 've already told haz@@ leton that it 's si@@ mian fever .
what , you really think co@@ co jr .
in there has two rare and deadly diseases ?
look , what 's more likely ?
they sent us samples of sh@@ f , which i 've been expecting for weeks ,
that 's reckless .
no , that .. that 's experience .
i 'm sorry , i 'm the only one
look , enough of this cra@@ p , okay ?
ebola ?
i 'm gonna need unequivocal proof .
i was about to introduce ebola zaire to the sample tissue .
i just need to get back in there .
all your samples were compromised during sterilization , ma 'am .
it 's protocol .
the patient is a 14-@@ year-old male ...
all right , one second . excuse me .
fourth day back , and i 'm already sc@@ rubbing in
well , fantastic !
yeah .
can you pick up the kids this afternoon ?
i would , but i have to entertain all of them .
i 'm not christina agu@@ il@@ era .
i can 't afford those places , not the good ones .
let me make some calls for you , please .
boy ...
you are as persistent as you are annoying .
you can walk as fast as you want ,
neither am i .
what is wrong with cal@@ lie ? she still hasn 't called me back .
ah , the recovery team tex@@ ted ,
hey , ross ?
could you run down to the e.@@ r .
and ask torres if she can pick up the kids today ?
we need to get someone from uro@@ logy down here now .
don 't you think i tried ? there 's an emergency ,
dr. wilson , it feels like i might explode .
i don 't think he 's gonna last 20 minutes .
dr. a@@ very , i 'm
there is nothing you can say after this morning
i have a giant penis .
of course , now my mom 's convinced that steph@@ an@@ ie
dude , you and your rich boy problems .
you know what the worst part is ?
i think she actually likes steph@@ an@@ ie .
well , so then you need to tell your mom that .
stand up for your girl .
that wouldn 't work . she 'd just hate her even more .
so what are you gonna do ?
nothing .
you know , it 's like walking into a hor@@ net 's nest .
you know , you gotta stay still . let the whole fren@@ zy die down .
excuse me .
sorry . pardon me .
who knew dr . shepherd was such a big shot ?
what are you doing here ?
you told me to scru@@ b in .
the night of the gala ? at your house , remember ?
oh , yeah . that night was so fun .
yeah . don 't worry . i won 't tell anyone what happened .
hey , um .. it 's a little tight in here .
uh , you could probably be more useful
oh . yeah . you 're probably right .
okay , sweet girl , just one more .
it 's puppy dog eyes , and i 'm not .
these are my regular eyes .
what do you want ?
your dad passed his stress test .
yang told me to discharge him .
good .
say it
but when i come back ,
sorry . i came to see if your drain output picked up
i can come back later .
you 're not progressing very quickly here .
they 're all in love with you , and afraid of you .
i mean , you pull your strings
you said that you would go if i set it up .
you said that you would go .
no , see , i never said that .
that 's against my policy . that 's how you screw up .
you tell someone you 're gonna do something ,
that 's how you lose your home ..
your family . make your children hate you .
look , you 're a sweet kid ,
but i don 't want to let you down , too .
all right ?
okay@@ . got that closed up .
now let me see . did i miss anything else ?
i don 't see anything .
that 's what 's called a rhetorical question , my dear .
all right , let 's take a look at this penis , shall we ?
uh , dr. a@@ very , can you elaborate
i 'm fascinated by all things pen@@ ile .
yes , i saw evidence of that earlier this morning .
how 's it looking , dear ?
well , it 's possible he 's gonna need a skin graft ,
yeah , he 'll be able to stick it in a hor@@ net 's nest ,
wherever they live .
well , i find that men often put their pen@@ ises
suction , dear , come on .
i 'm thinking about the patient .
wh@@ oa , dial it back for a second .
does she have a con@@ cussion ?
no , she 's fine . are you ?
you 're gonna be worried about that
she is my patient ,
dr. bail@@ ey knows the procedure .
sorry .
probably should have checked back earlier .
your .. white blood cell count is elevated .
i 'd like to start you on antibiotics .
why do i need antibiotics ?
because there 's a left shift ?
you need to examine me
murphy ..
after i put you in the cab ,
and you didn 't answer , so i went to check .
and good thing , because you were passed out
i helped you inside ...
and you insisted on having a dance party .
we made the most amazing gr@@ illed cheese sand@@ wic@@ hes

and he kept saying something about hitting her caro@@ tid .
did you give blood today , dr . kare@@ v ?
what ?
you 've been described as looking ,
i 'm asking
a@@ very gave blood , yang gave blood , grey gave blood .
i give blood every two months .
case in point .
dou@@ che .
wait , wait .
don 't stick me. i gotta go@@ . sorry .
so what was the problem ?
there was a problem .
i came back from seeing the fire@@ fighter off to surgery .
he@@ y. uh , my guys would like to line the hall for roy
you know , make a show of support .
he 's , uh , 35 years on the job ,
and there was a problem ,
no , i wasn 't waving at reed
hey , can you give me a hand ?
somebody page hunt and get me those labs .
i got her labs . i was shocked .
you 're a.@@ k. , right ?
april ke@@ p@@ ner ?
uh , no , no. this is alex kare@@ v .
wait a second@@ . what the hell ?
her carbon mon@@ oxide level was 28 ,
what the hell ?
b.@@ p. is 69 over 3@@ 2. pulse is 158 .
we 're already filling her with fluids .
they needed more hands .
keep her on 100 % oxy@@ gen. no , no , do not .
not until she is more stable .
cris@@ tina , scru@@ b out , go see if you can help@@ . go .
there was so much swelling , we couldn 't find good veins .
we had to start a central line .
we can 't use the hyper@@ bar@@ ic chamber until she 's stable .
open up , please .
oh , my god .
okay@@ . um , you look good .
these burns on your chest are pretty minor .
but the one on your calf might be third-@@ degree .
you never looked .
you didn 't look in her throat ,
oh@@ . where 's your mommy , pal ?
let 's go find mommy , huh ?
when we 're headed toward an outcome
that 's when we go looking for a second opinion .
it 's not the doctors , richard .
they 're all good doctors .
i know that .
what do you think this was for ?
for jen@@ nings , it was about legal .
but this was for me .
i needed to know who finally was responsible .
at least i was able to do that .
say it , derek .
maybe it 's not one doctor .
maybe it 's too many doctors ..
who don 't know each other
when i got to that room ...
there was chaos .
because that 's the system now ..
chaos .
obsessed with restoring natural order .
and to fund his operations ,
titan dna .
what the hell is someone gonna do with a giant worm ?
are you kidding , martin@@ ez ?
what can 't you do with it ?
at 0@@ 500 , we 'll ship out to launch a joint operation ...
i wouldn 't bother .
excuse me ?
sounds like a duck hunt to me .
uh , mark , why don 't we let colonel foster finish ..
a deco@@ y . a diversion .
look , they 've already got emma and the or@@ ca .
why would they want just this one when they 've got the keys
the mass extinction we feared has already begun .
and we are the cause .
we are the infection .
but like all living organisms ,
it 's original and rightful rulers ,
they are part of the earth 's natural defense system .
a way to protect the planet , to maintain its balance .
but if governments are allowed to contain them , destroy them ,
and within our lifetime , our planet will perish ,
unless we restore balance .
and what 's gonna be left , if you do this ?
a dead , char@@ red world , overrun by monsters ?
no , doctor stan@@ ton ,
i 'm gu@@ essing you weren 't expecting these guys .
moscow , london , washington , d.@@ c .
all under attack .
on every continent , the tit@@ ans are triggering
now as before , we have been trying to lure
their behavior has become random .
can you track him ?
no . signal 's too weak .
but maybe she can .
how many nu@@ kes do you have ?
why ?
we could help him .
this category six hurricane over d.@@ c .
is where king gh@@ id@@ or@@ ah is n@@ esting .
working with all four branches of the military ,
so this plan is what you would call a " long shot , " right ?
what do those ner@@ ds think they 're gonna do
you ain 't hear ' em , gri@@ ffin ?
they wanna bring god@@ z@@ illa back from the dead .
we 'll be out of range while you 're down there ,
appreciate it .
the greater boston area
all citizens to report to the nearest evacuation center
i repeat , all citizens
massive storms and other disasters
and with d.c. hit hard by a category six hurricane
the grim search continues , as people around the world
and though this sight is heart@@ breaking ,
cities around the globe have fallen
why ?
that 's how she made the signal for the or@@ ca .
the creatures just think it 's another apex predat@@ or .
well , that makes sense .
i mean , we are a bunch of hor@@ ny mur@@ der@@ ous carni@@ vo@@ res .
yeah , that 's real poetic . now what ?
we track it , we find it , and we get my daughter back .
what about mo@@ e , larry , and cur@@ ly over here ?
god@@ z@@ illa will bring balance .
oh , boy . god@@ z@@ illa 's radiation levels
we got about 12 minutes before he goes ther@@ mon@@ uc@@ lear .
what do you mean ?
i 'm saying in about 12 minutes ,
okay , guys , you need to find the or@@ ca ,
i 'm impressed .
it 's pretty rare that i don 't manage to ..
oh , spoke too soon .
i 'm gu@@ essing the bre@@ ed@@ ers aren 't singing in praise of the lord .
where did you get this ?
i 'm done here .
take a look at the contract ?
yeah .
all that 's left is your signature , and we 're good to go .
i think you 're going to do really well here , cam@@ mie .
perfect . now you 're officially a disci@@ ple of god 's promise .
welcome .
who@@ o !
i want you to put on your clothes and leave .
no , you don 't .
this movie 's weird .
i want you to leave .
you knew that was going to happen .
no , i didn 't .
i wouldn 't know what to do .
you can start by putting
i really didn 't know it was going to happen .
yes , you did .
no , just ..
i didn 't have a choice .
did you ?
i will not pray for god to change me
change will come through god
i must be the change .
i 've always known i didn 't want to act
then when i learned that that was a sin , also ,
what ?
you can 't get a pass from god to jer@@ k off .
who asked you ?
steve , what are you experiencing ?
i mean , just imagine you 're all sitting at a table together
it 's like watching michael angelo paint the si@@ s@@ tine chapel .
what ? why are you laughing ? you know i 'm right .
that is why i 'm laughing .
i mean , the system is working on you .
fuck you . no , it 's not working on me at all .
oo@@ oh
please ... please don 't stop . and so i cry sometimes
a little peculiar
and i wake in the morning
and i say , " hey , yeah , yeah , yeah "
jam@@ ie , i ..
" dear cameron , i 'm very angry at you
" you already had this thing in you , but i didn 't .
when i think of how long it took me
what if she 's right ..
what the fuck ?
you were making a lot of noise .
i 'm sorry . i 'm fine .
what were you dreaming about ?
i don 't remember , okay ? it was scary .
let 's go ! let 's go , baby . let 's go !
maybe the most amazing part of ad@@ on@@ is creed 's journey , roy .
don 't drop that guard ! sit .
... ... is that tonight , he fights ...
keep your hands up !
come on , d !
three years ago , that 's a kno@@ ck@@ out .
wheel@@ er 's power just isn 't the same , and no doubt creed can sense it .
you got him . stay on him !
creed 's on a mission , really pressing the issue now .
and a big left hook lands flush !
creed staying in the pocket , max . moving , not running .
come on , now ! hands up ! hands up !
these two men are really going at it .
tell him , don@@ nie !
another left hook drives wheel@@ er back .
come on , baby !
ain 't nothing personal .
can 't say i 'm proud of what our sport 's become ,
call it whatever you want .
sounds to me like you just trying to get paid .
the money is a side effect .
" the rum@@ ble in the jungle " didn 't just manifest itself .
somebody had to make it happen .
will it into existence .
oh , yeah , that 's supposed to be you , huh ?
you see anybody else standing here with a care in their heart ?
i want the same thing you want .
yeah ? what 's that ?
in the history of boxing ,
you know that ?
but how many do you think they know ?
four ?
five ?
the belt ain 't enough .
you need a narrative . something that sticks to the ribs .
your dad , he knew that .
creed clearly in pain , as he finds a way to his feet .
not ready to give up yet .
i don 't know . this is getting dangerous , jim .
okay ! come to me !
and now , bay@@ less is gonna let him go again .
ready ?
box !
huge right hook !
dra@@ go trying to end it .
and creed delivers a big right hand at the bell .
get back ! get back to your corner !
bay@@ less restraining dra@@ go , seemingly frustrated ..
obey my commands .
you gonna counter with the right
extend the right , crack him with the left .
he 'll never expect it . his old man did the same thing to me .
one early observation , max .
i think creed is withstanding dra@@ go 's combinations
box .
and round two begins .
dra@@ go with a huge left hook .
and a big right hand .
dra@@ go on the attack again , now driving creed back into the ropes .
okay , can i just point out that " technically " i didn 't dis@@ obey you ?
er@@ nie .
you said go to the store after school , and i stopped by .
there 's proof ! i left a note !
yeah , see ? i didn 't dis@@ obey you . i just took a brief , educational de@@ tour !
the way you 've been like a mother to orphan
but you deserve children of your own .
you 'll still look after us though , right ?
i mean , we don 't want those sar@@ cos sne@@ aking up on us
sh@@ h , come on now , don 't worry .
i 'm not going anywhere .
all of you are my family .
i 'll protect you from the sar@@ co brothers .
and then when my babies are big enough , they 'll protect you , too .
they are as weird looking as orphan is .
they are beautiful .
and they 'll grow up big and strong , like their mother .
now , everyone , sho@@ o ! my babies need their sleep ! now sho@@ o !
all right , all right .
now 's our chance .
jul@@ es , come on , we 'll just stay for a little while .
we can set the time machine
.... and mom will never know we were gone !
we won 't get in any trouble !
this isn 't about getting away with something , er@@ nie !
it 's about going back where we belong !
max , how do you get this to work
a h !
well , first you run the initi@@ alization sequence .
but the initi@@ alization sequence won 't even run
what if it fell off while we were going back in time ?
let 's eat them now
don 't eat me ! i 'm mostly fat !
if we don 't relocate soon , we won 't have a choice .
with all the earthquakes and the rising tar ,
soon , nothing in the lower valley will survive .
and when we get rid of ty@@ ra , the upper valley is ours for the taking
so you better have brought us some good news ,
we 've got news all right , bosses .
news you can use .
ty@@ ra 's had babies ! three of them !
more adoptions ?
no , she said they were her own !
and it looks like there 's another egg still in her nest !
another egg , huh ?
if it was taken , she 'd come look for it .
and then we can take care of her , once and for all .
my babies ' first night of life .
i can 't wait to teach them everything i know .
like something 's been checking it out .
i can 't tell where they go .
jul@@ es , come here !
they 're coming from the river !
come on ! let 's follow them .
hey , mom ! are you gonna let them leave the nest , huh ?
well , i want to see where these tracks lead to .
and it 'll be good practice for them .
f@@ let@@ cher will never know it was you who spoke up .
why would you do this to me ?
do you think that i would let him put my son through hell
don 't you know i would never let that happen ?
that there is nothing in the world more important to me than you ?
don 't you know that ?
andrew
hi , and ... i loaded your pan@@ try with g@@ ush@@ ers .
i saw that .
and he 's laughed off-@@ stage
he practices .
and he practices and he practices , with one goal in mind
and a year later he goes back to the reno .
and he steps up on that stage and he plays the
so imagine if jones just said .
" well that 's ok , charlie
to bird
but that 's just what the world wants now .
every star@@ bucks ' jazz album just proved my point , really .
there are no two words in english language
you know maybe .. you go to far , you discourage next
no. man , no .
because the next charlie parker would never be discouraged .
i never really had a charlie parker .
but i tried
and that 's more than most people ever do .
and i 'll never apologize for how i tried .
alright , see you later .
hey , andrew .
listen , i have no idea how you gonna take this , but
you understand what i 'm saying ?
then i 'll find you an enemy in a new country .
done , sir .
sir ... i often get this feeling that
you 're right ... for your cooking skills ...
and your insan@@ ity .
how do you live like this , tiger ?
this decade old furniture ,
your salary has been lying un@@ touched
why ?
how can i spend when i 'm never here ?
i have been traveling all over the world
wow .. how much have you saved ?
about 2.3 million .
but your money will rot in the agency 's bank ..
no ... i think you 're old enough to be married now .
no ... i 'm not married yet .
why ?
i don 't get to meet nice girls .
what are you looking for , mr. writer ?
nothing much ..
just a sweet simple girl ..
someone who 'd make me want to live only for her .
wow ... very romantic ..
okay .
thank you
aren 't you a little fus@@ sy when it comes to food ?
maybe a little .
so you want to spend some time with professor kid@@ wai ?
yes .... . so that i get to know him better .
i 'll try to speak to him ..
come to his house tomorrow morning .
but i can 't promise anything .
no problem .
just the way you like it , sir .
thank you .
and here 's the cheque .
whenever you are ready .
i hope you don 't mind if i leave you alone with your punc@@ tured eggs .
i 'm getting late for my play rehearsal . see you later .
you pay the bill .... . why should i ?
yes , of course ..
man@@ ish chan@@ dra ... . isn 't that a boring name ?
i wanted a boring name .
should sound like a decent guy ... right ?
look at her gorgeous hair ...
okay ' decent guy ' , listen ...
you 'll have to get close to the professor now .
i 'm thinking .. people here are so honest ...
they don 't even bolt their doors ...
i should bar@@ ge into the professor 's house
oh , no ...
like .. have dinner ?
mr. writer .... are you asking me out on a date ?
date ?
no ... i mean .. we can have a meal ...
i 'm going out with my friends tonight .
join us ... i 'll let you pay the bill .
sure .
but i hope you won 't turn up like this ?
like what ?
just get a little cooler ..
keep your foot behind that line .
hey , everybody ! !
guys listen .. this is my friend man@@ ish ... he 's from india .
hey man@@ ish , it 's your turn ..
have you ever thrown dar@@ ts ?
hello .
no problem , sir .
you know what ? you don 't look like a writer .
for example ..
your hands .. they are not like a writer 's ..
they 're cut and bru@@ ised like a wrest@@ ler 's .
why did you become a writer ?
just followed my heart .
very few people follow their hearts , you 're lucky .
the most important thing for an agent is ...
that he should use his head and not his heart .
the day you follow your heart , consider yourself dead .
i admire a man who follows his heart .
honestly , i want to convey something to your daughter
so , mr naz@@ ar , what should i do according to your any tips ?
man@@ ish
hey , cav@@ eman
i need a drink .
what the hell are you saying ?
can 't people like us fall in love ?
of course we can@@ . but not on a mission .
when are we not on a mission ?
and do we have a life beyond these missions or not ?
mission !
is zo@@ ya also ?
and now everyone calls me that .
tiger is a name meant for dogs .
i warned you .. in an attempt to woo her
say thank you now ..
should i tell you something ..
you 've chosen a nice girl ..
it 's five in the morning@@ . get some sleep ...
it 's her play in the evening .
sorry ...
excuse me ?
in ten minutes you 've destroyed half of dublin ...
and that agent got away too ... what the hell are you doing , tiger ?
what else could i have done in that situation ?
and that guy would have come to know that i 'm not a writer .
not just him ... the whole town will know you 're not a writer .
where will the professor be right now ?
must be watching the play .. what else ?
so let 's create our own world ..
let 's run away , zo@@ ya .
you have gone mad ... don 't talk nonsense .
god alone knows how long our two countries will keep fighting ...
we cannot wait for them end@@ lessly .
and it might be a little difficult to run when we 're old .
tiger ...
hurry up .... we have to go to the airport !
hello ... zo@@ ya , are you there ?
we 're getting late for the airport .
please hurry and come down .
sir , we can 't get through to tiger 's phone . he 's out of reach ..
sir ... i think he 's been kidnapped by the pakistan@@ is .
kidnapped ! nonsense !
he 's too good for them .
listen ... this news should not get out .
okay , sir .
take the next flight from london and get here .
which bank has he withdrawn the money from ?
how much ?
sir ... a total of 47 thousand dollars , sir ...
47 thousand dollars ?
sir ... about 2.3 million ru@@ pe@@ es .
should be 2.3 million ..
the day i retire .. i 'll blow it all up .
tiger has not been kidnapped !
do you have any idea ...
how much classified information tiger has about our organisation ?
if anyone gets hold of that information ..
it will compromise the security of our agents all over the world .
sir ... i don 't know exactly where tiger is or what he 's up to ...
but he will never give away that kind of information whilst he 's alive ...
i 'm certain about that .
sir ...
we just heard that ...
a pakistani delegate is also missing since this morning .
what ?
this is the address of the hotel .
okay .
this hotel belongs to his friend .
he 'll help us book the tickets for tomorrow .
how long will you take ?
might take a long .. maybe all night ... you take care .
sir .... . this is zo@@ ya .
sir ?
there are 201 countries in the world ..
and bloody tiger could find a girl only from pakistan ?
captain abra@@ r ... why have you called me here ?
meeting like this can der@@ ail the whole plan .
because i 'm worried about you ...
he is an extremely dangerous agent .
i am fine .. but you will all have to be a little more patient .
it 's not that easy to trick him .
what you 're saying is right ...
but we must know what you are up to and where exactly are you ?
he does not suspect me at all ..
but to get him to you here is too risky .
i 'll get him to you , but not here ...
for once i followed my heart .
i just wanted to see where this decision would take me .
i 'm am@@ used at the thought of what will happen in kazakhstan now .
seen anyone like her ?
see there . . in that car .
they look like bloody indians .
pakistani go@@ ons ..
captain abra@@ r ...
sir ... it 's been close to four hours since the istanbul flight landed ..
and no one has shown up .
alright ...
si@@ r. the information about kazakhstan was wrong .
no one arrived there today .
there were two other big flights that left istanbul yesterday .
one to london and the other to frankfurt .
then find out from there how many other flights departed ..
sir .... there are 6@@ 23 flights at london
total number of passengers 8@@ 25,@@ 8@@ 02 ...
and those two could be traveling on a passport of any nationality ...
i don 't care .
keep searching ... we have to find them .
sir ... my point is ...
if tiger has decided ... then it will be very difficult to find him .
we have created tiger !
raw was functioning before him ..
and will continue even after him .
enough !
what is it that they have and we don 't ?
five minutes are more than enough ..
i don 't care ... if you have to shoot him ... then do it
so , g@@ op@@ i .... you want me to be shot ?
you deserve to be shot .
what have i done ?
what have you done ?
tiger , do you know how many countries there are in the world ?
201 countries .. there are 201 countries and you ..
really ?
then where is she ?
call her .. let 's leave .
for that i 'll need you and your boys .
why ? you just told me that she 's ready .
yes but those people who she is with right now
who are they ?
our friends .
so let me get this straight ..
you want us to attack the isi in cuba ...
why .... to kid@@ nap a girl ?
girl ?
the same girl was your sister@@ -in-law in dublin ...
when you found out she was a pakistani .
you demo@@ ted her from sister@@ -in-law to just a girl ?
hey cav@@ eman ...
whatever needs to be done , should be done now
tiger ... tiger ... tiger ...
what the hell is tiger doing ?
that 's the plan ... to@@ kas , you will be here .
sir ... ba@@ bl@@ u .... you 'll be at this point ...
you , cav@@ eman .... . you got an entire army just to catch me ?
sir ... don 't forget we came here to catch that man
one last time .. you 'll be here .
tomorrow morning sharp at eight .
our flight will take off in two hours ...
don 't try anything strange at the airport .
you know what ? you got three coming in .
get out the back door now , move .
anybody in here ?
yeah , we got one coming around the corner now .
your three guests are coming out of the door behind you right now .
watch your six .
oh , z@@ inger .
should have brought more bullets .
i thought they were chocolate sprink@@ les which i would eat normally .
but this tasted like ... there 's no other way to say it really .
like a rat sauce .
hey guys , can you please keep it down ?
look . unfortunately there 's ver@@ min in the ceiling again .
burger king was booked up .
sorry . i 'm having dinner with gall@@ ag@@ her over here .
guard your fruit !
you could . you 're funny . your timing is perfect .
never as funny as you , super cooper .
it 's not pink eye , ma 'am .
it 's just .. i 'm having a bit of a allergic reaction .
well , i 'm allergic to dis@@ gus@@ ting childhood illness .
so stay away from me .
sorry .
anyway , you are right .
after boy@@ an@@ ov 's death ,
the chat@@ ter picked up later that night .
what do we know about her ?
i can pull up her file .
oh , that 's stuck .
so warm in here .
i 'll pull up my file .
jesus , not on my keyboard , with your pink eye infected fingers .
why don 't you just cry directly into my mouth while you 're at it .
it really is just a allergic reaction .
it 's quite but@@ tery .
wow . okay , we could order you your own glass .
that was mine !
my life is a disaster .
no , it 's not .
i 'm 40 , i live by myself .
i 've not been in a real relationship since jerry left me three years ago
i mean , when i gave up teaching to join the cia .
i thought everything is going to be different .
i thought i was going to be this amazing spy .
hey , you two cu@@ ties sitting here being all cute .
have an old fashioned , please .
his service is really slow .
super slow .
you 're not getting that in the next hour .
here you go , miss walker . thank you .
any sign of her in the house ?
heat sensors aren 't picking anything up .
there 's some kind of interference .
i don 't like this , tine .
i 'm up for the challenge .
let 's go in .
shoot . there is something wrong with your camera .
can you switch out for a new one ?
too late
her father would never have let himself this exposed .
pull back , fine , this is too easy .
i like things that are easy .
oh my god , fine .
i don 't know how you do things like that .
hey . who 's the finest of them all ?
i don 't know
drop your weapon .
fine , what 's happening ?
let me guess , whoever is in your ear wants to know what 's happening ?
ee 's about to die

yes , it does !

seriously . you got to cut that out .
jesus , look .

doesn 't matter if we 've been exposed .
we 've all gone deep before , and we always gotten our guy .
guys . this is more than just a kill mission .
now we get ray@@ na , de luc@@ a and some top terrorist leadership
we just need someone who could shadow them without attracting attention .
ms. cro@@ c@@ ker , i would really like to do this .
for tine
i don 't have any cats !
you 're not seriously considering this , are you ?
look here , betty .
ford , if you call me betty cro@@ c@@ ker ,

you might as well accept my resignation now .
it 's amazing . that is really super cool .

i , um
you know , " let him be happy " ? what about me , you know ?
everybody 's making these huge life decisions ,
how i 'll feel , you know ?
i 'm supposed to be such a big part of their lives ,
you know , starting up new families
but i don 't have to teach him what to care .
do you even have the authority to ban someone from nic@@ u ?
i don 't know .
oh , oh , oh
that 's okay .
i just came by to tell you that you were wrong .
those , uh , peanut butter cups got me nowhere .
you 're kidding .
guess you overes@@ timated that a@@ very spar@@ kle , huh ?
i think it 's right that you continue her work .
but i really just want to cure her disease .
l want a house
built of old
you could paint it any color
i was staring at mount eve@@ rest , and i was ready to climb .
i 'm sorry . i 'm not really comfortable talking about this .
so , my legs were on his shoulders .
it was a lovely evening .
and my feet were , like , way up in the air ,
and it was worth it .
oh , my god , it was so worth it , until
boom !
then her legs .. snapped .
it was@@ . terrible .
it was terrible !
but this is way worse .
okay , her pain 's still not controlled .
she 's ma@@ xed out on me@@ ds .
we 'll have to reduce her under general .
i needed to confirm that she withheld information
that she legally committed fraud , and she did .
and now
don 't stop . don 't hesitate .
you can 't be scared of what 's next .
can you just let me in ?
well , all right , but i don 't see this as a promising endeavor .
okay , here 's the deal .
we are going to throw leonard a kick@@ -@@ ass
i hardly think so .
leonard made it very clear he doesn 't want a party .
did someone say ... " party " ?
he just doesn 't know he wants one ' cause he 's never had one .
i suppose that 's possible , but for the record ,
howard ,
fin@@ e. if i do have a thre@@ esome , you can 't be part of it .
if you make a mark in a mint comic book , it 's no longer mint .
shel@@ don , do you understand the concept of blackmail ?
well , of course , i .. oh .
yeah , i have an idea .
let 's throw leonard a kick@@ -@@ ass birthday party .
that 's not the secret knock .
this is the secret knock .
what difference does it make ?
the whole point of a secret knock is to establish a
is that ra@@ i and howard ?
possibly , but un@@ verified .
will you just let us in .
so what 'd you get the birthday boy ?
well , ra@@ i got him an awesome ,
and i got him this amazing auto@@ graph@@ ed copy
nice .
i got him a sweater .
okay , well , he might like that .
i 've seen him get chil@@ ly .
shel@@ don , i didn 't see your present .
that 's because i didn 't bring one .
why not ? don 't ask .
the entire institution of gi@@ ft-@@ giving makes no sense .
friends give each other presents .
i accept your premise ; i reject your conclusion .
try telling him it 's a non-@@ optional social convention .
what ?
just do it .
fin@@ e. it 's out of the was@@ her !
i 'll call you when it 's in the dr@@ yer .
what do you think ?
um , that one .
because of the two additional ether@@ net ports ?
sure@@ .he doesn 't need them .
he 's already got a six-@@ port ether@@ net switch .
oh , okay , then this one .
why ? i don 't know .
the man on the box looks so happy .
penny , if i 'm going to buy leonard a gift ,
water ! need water ! i 'll be right back .
penny , listen , i 've got a problem .
yeah , well , so do i .
look , you gotta stall leonard a little longer .
i don 't think i can .
you have to@@ . we all have to be there at the same time to y@@ ell surprise .
okay , you have to understand something .
we 're in a hospital right now .
why ? is leonard okay ?
leonard 's fine . i 'm fine .
thanks for asking , by the way .
okay , i don 't need your attitude .
listen , just hold him there a little longer .
look , i 've done my best ,
ok , , how about this ?
you keep him there a little longer , and when you get to the party ,
don 't toy with me , woman .
i got a hot former fat girl with no self-esteem ,
thy will be done .
well .
well , maybe there 'll be more planes double-@@ checking or ships ?
what the hell are they telling you in boot camp ?
we are at war , al@@ dr@@ ich .
we 're in the vicinity of enemy naval forces .
we get one quick look at best .
pockets , everything , pile it on the shirt .
got two magazines .
i got my pocket knife .
keep that in your pocket . the last thing we need is a hole in this raft .
pair of pli@@ ers , bit of wire ,
here 's a whistle .
al@@ dr@@ ich .
take another drift set . that 's not how i 'm reading those wave tops .
yes , chief .
15 degrees . same read as the out@@ bound , chief .
if that 's correct , then she 's east . i had her west .
al@@ dr@@ ich ?
no , thanks .
see , that 's why you got to do it last
it 's beautiful , isn 't it ?
be better if we could eat it .
i was doing all right , see . i didn 't expect no , " a. "
no , it was another one .
i thought i ought to get a " b " or any@@ ways a " c "
marks in school as long i learned the stuff .
and i had this course down good .
i saw that report card , and saw that big shiny " f. "
so what 'd you do ?
i just walked out of school and never went back .
and you had that course down good , you reckon .
you bet i did .
ain 't there a rule ?
a guy can have a handful and still be okay ?
suc@@ ks the water right out of your brains , they say .
coming up on 120 hours .
five days , not a sip .
al@@ dr@@ ich ? more like southeast two to three ?
yeah , affirmative .
okay , then .
here we are , by dead reck@@ oning .
then where are we headed ?
with luck , right here .
those islands i told you about , there 's a chain of ' em to our southwest .
closest friendly land in the pacific .
now if this favorable wind will just push us there .
what if it just keeps shifting , chief ?
the chart don 't take us nowhere .
unless .
no , you won 't , tony .
you want a damn watch so bad ?
why don 't you sit here staring at nothing all day ?
i do my share . more .
what 's that supposed to mean ?
who do you think is navi@@ gating this ship ? are you ?
then where are these islands you told us about ?
kid@@ neys would be easy .
yeah , one for each man .
i think we need some other kind of talk .
i 'm trying . but everything 's so far away .
just remembered something .
my wife ..
she had a pretty yellow dress .
she burned a hole in it with her cigarette .
so she se@@ wed a little white dove over the hole .
i can picture the dress and the dove .
but i can 't really see her face .
tony .
i do believe i am in love with your sister .
you 'll make a great couple .
i want you boys to know ... .
so , take a look at the timeline here on fu@@ tu@@ rec@@ ast ...
... clouds are going to start to build ,
as we get deeper into the afternoon , though ,
2 : 00 to 4 : 00 p.m. , you can see a few ...
i don 't know much .
what i do know is this :
a very good woman .
and she was always there for her family .
do not forget ,
all of us .
death , however ,
therefore , let us all pray for her soul .
pray that she crosses over to where she needs to go .
and she wants to do a brave , no-@@ makeup role .
without a co-@@ star .

maybe i can use this as a tiny nap@@ kin ring .
wait !

i mean , it happened 20 years ago ,

even good guys make mistakes if the circumstances are right .
interesting point . wish you hadn 't made it
susan , i am in the middle of nowhere .
the only female i 've seen has ant@@ lers .

thanks for the advice .
just so you know , when you come home ,
her name is carol .
oh .. just ..
having a sad day .
you 've been having a lot of sad days . is it because grace left ?
why would you say that ?
that was when you started being sad .. the day she went away .
i suggested she leave the lane for a while .
the taxi picked her up this morning .
oh , my god . so why ... why are you telling me this ?
because i have a little proposition for you .
and given how the neighbors feel about you these days ,
someone sold you their house ?
oh , yes .
we shouldn 't have sold .
we should have just gone under
which would have been very noble and very stupid .
mit@@ zi sold . she 's not gonna be around
didn 't have a choice .
what the hell ?
mit@@ zi , what are you doing here ?
i live here . oh , i guess you would have noticed ,
but we thought you left .
this guy says he has a job for me in the city .
puts me up in a nice hotel , and then he never showed .
huh , and i got stuck with the mini@@ bar charges .
so , wait . you didn 't sell your house to paul young ?
what ?
please . i 'm not gonna screw over my neighbors .
lee ?
ok .. okay .
what is happening to this neighborhood ?
some van just pulled up ,
that is a school bus , rene@@ e . those are children .
well , i don 't like the way they 're looking at me .
hey . i didn 't ask her to move here .
well ..
maybe it 's time you ask her to leave .
so the whole right side of the closet is yours ,
thank you .
no . no , i think us is a mistake .
i wish we had been nic@@ er to paul .
i wish we had stood by him when he was on trial .
i think about what he must have gone through in prison ,
but i won 't allow him to destroy this street .
it 's not right .
don 't worry .
we will stop this son of a bitch .
that 's a promise .
hey . m.@@ j. ' s spending the night at a friend 's house ,
so , uh , why are you here ?
he also mentioned all that work that needs to be done
uh , wait . uh , you don 't need to do that .
but if you wanna thank me ,
mayor franklin . what an honor . paul young .
the media will be arriving shortly ,
uh , with the election just a few days away ,
while you 're waiting , would you like a tour of the facility ?
you 're gonna have to leave .
okay . maybe i mis@@ read some signals .
there have been no signals . i was dating your son .
okay . if that 's the way you feel ,
okay . yeah , yeah , here we are .
well , here 's trouble .

that is my patient .
not anymore . your patient is , uh ..
do you have any idea how difficult it is
there was no way to do the repair without visibility .
mm , no , there was no easy way .

she was dying !
no , just go . let me clean up your mess .
come on .

he made me his family , and then i abandoned him .

i can 't spend the rest of my life
not knowing where she is ,
i have to find her .
well , there 's a private detective i work with .
but san@@ chez is a pretty common name .
if 's not surprising the hospital couldn 't find ' em .
but i know something the hospital doesn 't .
when i was in labor ,
she lived in el pas@@ o , and she was so excited to have
that 's gonna help .

i 'm buying all my girls ste@@ aks . you got a preference ?
this is a cocktail car@@ dig@@ an .

where 's your closet ?
i have never seen so many sweater sets .
are you sure this is a closet and not a portal to the 1950s ?
there is nothing wrong with my clothing .
oh , i won 't need a ride . i 'm going home with keith .
oh , i don 't think so . he just left .
oh , he 's pulling the car around .
now you think i should play
'@@ cause i 'm not .

oh . i 'll be careful when i un@@ wrap him .
rene@@ e , wait . please don 't go home with keith .
why ?
oh , he 's the one you like , isn 't he ?
you don 't want to come off like a slu@@ t .
aw , gee , then chip won 't ask me to the prom .

but he was ex@@ on@@ erated .
fel@@ icia till@@ man framed him .
yeah , for that crime .
what do you mean ?
before fel@@ icia showed up around here .
her sister martha was murdered . and , all due respect ,
does everybody think that ?
fel@@ icia may be a few fingers short of a high five ,
well , that 's enough dus@@ ting for today , boys .
i guess all that 's left is a little vacu@@ um@@ ing .
o@@ oh ! y@@ ay ! get the vacuum .
looking forward to it .
max@@ ine says i can 't go back online
wow . and i thought your acting was bad on the web site .

i fre@@ aked out when i didn 't get that bonus check .

yeah , well , i know what that 's like .
and even with that extra money .
i always feel like i 'm living week to week .
flat screen tv , closet full of new clothes .
i know . probably shouldn 't have bought all that .
but you know how it is .
every once in a while , you want a little spl@@ urge .
yeah , i get that .
but ... definitely by the end of the year ,

well , the company will cover all costs .
we 'll just dig a small trench ,
it 'll look as good as new .

you can look for yourself .
wh@@ oa , wh@@ oa . what are you doing ? !
mr. mah@@ one .
they 're here .
those escaped convic@@ ts.@@ they 're here in town .

there was this strange man .
i made him a peanut butter sandwich .
i thought he was billy .
and once the kids went to sleep ,
a long ... bath .
and afterwards , i 'd just sit there
do her routine , see .
rub her lo@@ tion on , comb her hair .
thanks . i painted it myself .
this is my partner , jay pr@@ it@@ ch@@ et@@ t .
i represent jet@@ at@@ ech . are you familiar with us ?
not in the least .
oh , you 'll have to forgive jay .
anyway , our building is two doors down ,
we want this lot ,
that 's a nice offer , j@@ are ,
it 's not about the huge profits .
we 're building my son-@@ in-law 's dream ,
oh , i know all about dreams .
someday , i hope to get into encrypted packet switching .
good luck to you , gentlemen .
jay , this man 's vision just got blur@@ ry with tears .
would you get a@@ hold of yourself .
i just said that cra@@ p to drive the price up .
he 'll be back .
i don 't want him to come back .
whether you meant it or not , this is my dream .
we 're in this to make money .
and we will .
by the power vested in me by the commercial zoning board ,
that 's a good om@@ en .
i 'm gonna po@@ go it .
anybody else bring a sho@@ vel ?
oh , thank god you 're here . it 's a nightmare .
the staff is in an upro@@ ar about these budget cuts .
telling them there 's no more overtime was bad ,
i don 't know what else to do .
sal@@ es-@@ wise we didn 't exactly have
what do people give each other , anyway ?
shut up ! you are not a puzzle sol@@ ver , you never have been .
you 're a drama queen !
now there is a man in there about to die .
the game is on , solve it !
he is the napoleon of blackmail .
no chance for you to be a hero this time , mr holmes .
the alternative , however , would require your approval .
to the very best of times , john .
did you miss me ?
how is this possible ?
how is the exile going ?
i 've only been gone four minutes .
well , i certainly hope youve learnt your lesson .
who needs me this time ?
miss me ?
mrs hudson , there is a woman in my sitting room !
is it intentional ?
she 's a client .
said you were out , insisted on waiting .
would you , er , care to sit down ?
didn 't you ask her what she wanted ?
you ask her !
why didn 't you ask her ?
for god 's sake , give her some lines ,
good afternoon . i am sher@@ lock holmes ,
you may speak freely in front of him ,
holmes !
however , before you do ,
you have recently married a man
you have come to this agency as a last resort ,
good lord , holmes !
all of this is , of course , perfectly evident from your perfume .
her perfume ?
yes , her perfume , which brings insight to me and disaster to you .
how so ?
we are ready to begin .
begin what ?
sometimes to solve a case , one must first solve another .
oh , you have a case , then , a new one ?
an old one , very old .
i shall have to go deep .
deep ? into what ?
myself .
you , you 're dead , you can 't be here , you died !
am i not beautiful , thomas ?
as beautiful as the day you married me ?
who ..
what the hell is all this about ? !
what does it look like , my handsome friend ?
you may leave any time you like .
dr ho@@ op@@ er , i asked mr holmes to come here . cooperate .
that 's an order .
there are two " features of interest , "
i never say that .
you do , actually , quite a lot .
first of all , this is definitely em@@ elia ri@@ co@@ le@@ tti .
she has been categorically identified .
beyond a doubt , it is her .
then who was that in lim@@ e@@ house last night ?
that was also em@@ elia ri@@ co@@ le@@ tti .
it can 't have been . she was dead , she was here .
she was positively identified
he had no reason to lie , could hardly have been mistaken .
hmm , maybe it was a secret twin .
a what ? !
a secret twin .
hmm ? you know ?
a twin that nobody knows about .
this whole thing could have been planned .
since the moment of conception .
how breath@@ tak@@ ingly pres@@ ci@@ ent of her .
it is never twins , watson !
then what 's your theory ?
more to the point , what 's your problem ?
i , i don 't understand ...
oh , isn 't he observ@@ ant , now that daddy 's gone
really ?
yes , really .
amaz@@ in@@ q .... what one has to do to get ahead in a man 's world .
what 's he saying that for ?
get back to work !
well , holmes ? surely you must have some theory ?
not yet .
these are deep waters , watson , deep waters .
and i shall have to go deeper still .
it was not for several months that we were to pick up
and then under very unexpected circumstances .
five of them now , all the same , every one of them .
hus@@ h , please , this is a matter of supreme importance .
what is ?
how do you know that ?
i can tell .
i 'm not a kid anymore .
i know when you 're hiding stuff .
well .
you 're growing up so fast .
oh , honey , a part of me still sees you
but every day you 're getting stronger and smarter .
i had a pair that matched .
people would always look at us .
because you were a grown woman in pink stri@@ ped over@@ alls .
they probably thought we were a christian singing group .
they 'd say we looked sweet together .
i wouldn 't trade that memory for anything .
i know this is hard .
this is really happening to me .
love bites , doesn 't it ?
what did , uh , frank do ?
he was really sweet .
handed me a box of kle@@ en@@ ex , said all the right things .
but trust me , i 'm never seeing him again .
well , think of it this way .
it cost you one guy to face the truth .
your marriage is over .
now you can move on just like tom .
y@@ ip@@ pee for me .
m@@ m-@@ hmm .
the only way to live life is wildly .
what ?
you took b@@ ree out drinking ?
yeah . why ? is that bad ?
how the hell could rene@@ e take her out drinking ? !
doesn 't she know b@@ ree 's an alcoholic ?
i have known rene@@ e a long time ,
well .. at least this helps explain the way b@@ ree 's been acting lately .
i don 't know . there 's not enough boo@@ ze in the world
how could we not know this ?
an intervention ? you 've gotta be kidding me .
we 're your friends . we wanna help .
get out ! all of you !
a@@ of jo@@ u .
idiot .
talk to us , swee@@ tie . why are you be@@ having like this ?
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
it 's not like we can 't see what 's going on .
and what about all these men ? we know about that , too .
wow , can 't hide anything from you girls , huh ?
and did you also know i tried to kill myself ?
what ?
oh , my god .
how 'd that little nu@@ g@@ get of information
if this is a joke , it 's not funny .
it 's not a joke .
i checked into a mo@@ tel room
with the j@@ oc@@ ks at southwest ?
or the " in crowd " at the virgin terminal ?
you know who 's going to be a terminal virgin ?
you can make all the death threats you want ,
the fact that you two work at the airport .
hey , everybody !

i 'm making friends in the ts@@ a .
jud@@ y , big gal , little beard ?
having lunch with her at the w@@ ok n " roll
it 's pretty quiet over there these days .
opening day , i 'm so excited
seriously . i haven 't been this excited
if it isn 't , you 're not doing it right .
i 'm just happy i get to be out front here .
finally , i won 't be stuffed in the back .
i mean unless i run into a republican senator
come on , let 's open up .
but d@@ at key though ?

don 't walk away now
the surgery is a bad idea , chief
in your hands ... is it impossible ?
okay ?
okay , i 'll do it . i 'll try .
oh , you don 't even want to know .
i had perfect grades , perfect record ,
my parents couldn 't do a thing about it .

it was a procedure i 've done before .
i handled it , and she 's fine .
yeah , but what if she wasn 't ?
no , he 's not gonna fire me
only he was giving me words of encouragement ,
for the record , you rock that in there .
hunt 's just jealous he didn 't do it himself .

you know , i knew that sweater wasn 't stolen .
and here i pick blue yarn to match your eyes ,
although you look amazing in black . damn you .

it 's bad that the baby list@@ ens to such terrible things .
he 's heard worse .
hello you .
well you can stand then .
i kind of owe you an apology .
for not telling me your name

yeah , it was used in human sacrifices .
i guess one too many .
can i buy you a drink ?
yeah sure .
this is where i come all the time .
i like to sit and people watch .
oh right here .
this is nice .
so what can this piece of ass get you ?
oh shit , you heard that ?

the dogs have got it right .
nothing you could ve done
the blood supply to her brain was cut off
so even though dr. shepherd was able to fix
she 's brain dead . i get it .
she 's only 16 .
that 's good news .
she 'll be an excellent candidate for organ donation .
excellent candidate . excellent organs . young .
dude ..
you were robbed . you got scre@@ wed by politics .
the chief , he needed a scap@@ e@@ goat . it 's so unfair .
i 'm sorry .
i can 't do this .
how should i know ? i thought she was here .
she 's avoiding me . she won 't answer my pages .
so what do you want me to do about it ?
well , you guys are together now , right ?
so why don 't you talk to her and find out
you 're just pis@@ sed she 's not here
she won 't talk to me .
it 's just george .
your friends , though ,
wh@@ -@@ what is that anyway ?
it 's how we learn , by doing .
and i lost my shot at the solo surgery
anyway , there 'll always be sur@@ ger@@ ies .
there won 't always be fi@@ ance@@ e who 's come back from their dead
i mean , the only time they ever bother with us
that 's not true .
dr. slo@@ an took the time to teach me today ,
he likes you
oh , don 't tell me you haven 't noticed his eyes on your ass .
you are delu@@ sional .
is he cutting into her throat ?
bloody hell .
so i suppose you 'll use a strip test
that can damage the endo@@ th@@ eli@@ um
i can leave .
dr. slo@@ an , i w
i was just trying to learn
i mean , these residents are running around
i 'm very sorry for your loss but tests confirm
she has no thoughts , no emotions , no senses .
i 'm dr. di@@ xon .
i will be harvesting your sister 's organs
please , she 's our baby . we need more time .
i 'm very sorry for your loss ,
they could save many lives .
wake up , hol@@ ly
i 'm very sorry for your loss but your sister can 't wake up .
her basic functions are gone . her brain is dead .
i knew what i was doing , so if you want to punish someone
you know who your father is
so if i were you ,
yes , sir . thank you , sir .
there are people dying .
right now , there are people dying .
it 's inappropriate .
you made it personal .
none of you said anything .
those were all our interns .
but i won this .
they picked me .
if i don 't deserve this solo surgery .
then none of us do .
i don 't know if i 'm more jealous of alex
i think there 's something wrong with her . mer .
there 's something wrong with all of us . george
not here .
here
yeah . i need you to scru@@ b in with me .
i 'm fre@@ aking out . i 'm fre@@ aking out

what the hell ?
hello , boys .

yeah , that wasn 't half bad .
hey , listen , i 'm sorry i y@@ elled .
no , no , no . that 's what i needed .

so bring it , jay !
you stin@@ k , phil .

and he wasn 't just talking to phil .
he was talking to 10-@@ year-old you

she doesn 't believe in psych@@ ics .
it 's not just psych@@ ics .
i 'm going to save you some time .
she doesn 't have a boyfriend .
maybe not now , but soon .
you see ?
that means
you are going to meet someone special .
i see a handsome man on a horse ,
well , i am going to a renaissance fair this weekend .
yes , i know .
there 's no renaissance fair .
even if there was , i wouldn 't go .
i guess some people just aren 't comfortable taking center stage .
okay . well , maybe we can pump marcus
he 's too sick .
but don 't worry , cam , you 'll think of something .
it 's always dark@@ est right before the ..
reu@@ ben , could you keep that thing still ? !
okay , well , i guess we only have one option .
unbearable .
i 'll play it on the way back . i have it on my i@@ pod phone .
and the cat 's in the cradle
i don 't know when ,
i never made the time .
luke !
i need to call my son .
what time is it in damascus ?
why don 't i just draw them a map ?
ready to play , phil ?
i can 't , carl ! my boy 's sets are in a play !
i get the feeling that something wonderful
yes , it 's man@@ ny .
he got the lead role in the school play .
yes , that 's it .
okay , i think you might have met her halfway on that one .
do you feel that ?
a presence has just entered the room .
or the a.@@ c. kicked in .
gl@@ oria , i have to say something .
come on , mama . let 's get you un@@ packed .
oh , yes , let 's do , ' cause i brought you a present@@ . let 's go . come on .
it 's all recipes .
not just any recipes .
some of these have been in my family since before the war of northern aggression .
i mean what i mean .
um , well ...
i guess mike didn 't tell you that i 'm , uh , really not a cook .
oh , no , he told me .
that 's why i gave you these recipes , and i 'm gon ' teach you how to make ' em , too .
isn 't that nice , honey ?
so should i sne@@ ak out the back ?
oh , no . that 's my land@@ lady . she 's cool .
she knows you 're dealing ?
well , she 's not that cool .
oh , hey , guys !
i wish i could say the same for your real estate agent .
well , what do you mean ?
what is this ?
you left it in the printer .
it 's a house listing .
yeah , for a house in baltimore .
it 's all an act , sweetheart . you don 't see it now , but you will .
he 's only back because he wants something .
i don 't know what exactly .
i just know we 're not safe here .
oh , sure . that 's it . d has some evil plan .
it couldn 't be that he wants to be in my life , that he loves me .
he isn 't capable of love , dy@@ lan .
i found that out the hard way ,
move if you want .
i 'm staying here with my father .
but what happened ? things were going fine .
i was thinking i 'd take him for a few hours .
it 's not really a good time .
well , b@@ ree , whenever i call , it 's not a good time ,
well , that sounds boring . i know .
you give her a dental exam with your tongue ?
b@@ ree , you don 't understand .
i don 't think so .
i 'd hate for him to be around en you had another attack of delayed morality ,
i am not having this argument .
he is my son , too .
not exactly .
el@@ lie , your door is locked ! el@@ lie !
oh , shut up already .
mom , guess what ? dad 's coming to my senior rec@@ ital next week .
i could swing by and pick you up , if you want .
we could make it a real family outing .
dy@@ lan , your father and i need to talk .. in private .
i 'm not done saying good-@@ bye .
yes , you are .
please get rid of that gum .
meaning what ? you still love me ?
i do .
and i know i 'm somewhat to blame for what 's happened between us .
at 's why i 've forgiven you for kidnapping our daughter .
the least you can do is meet me halfway .
wayne
maybe not , but i 'm gonna give it to you anyway ' cause ...
i still think we could be happy together .
could we ?
" selling drugs brings in more money than waiting tables . "
okay , look , maybe i was wrong . maybe it was flour . maybe she 's a pa@@ stry chef .
yeah ! and she came up with that tat@@ too cover story to hide her illicit baking .
all right , look , i know we have to do something , but this woman 's our friend .
yes , and i 'm a convicted fel@@ on still on probation .
are you involved with either one of them ?
um , dou@@ g 's gay .
and mal@@ col@@ m , i did have a thing but it 's over .
he got me in with open space though ,
yes . i heard .
oh , thank you , yeah , i 'm done .
it would 've been awesome if you saw no exit .
daddy said you were really good .
i was alright .
it wasn 't my best nic@@ ht but at least he could get ,
figure out why he 's doing ,
what do you mean ?
um , it 's just really nice of him to help out .
no , i 'm fine . just go get a drink or something , okay ?
it 's gonna be delicious .
oh i hope so .
it will be . can 't wait .
nice to meet you . hi , how are you ?
it 's a very big decision , we 're excited .
of friends who 've been trying for years .
and they just had their first child .
so we 'll see .
it 's really nice to meet you .
well , yeah .
i think i deserve a class of wine after all that , don 't you ?
want one ?
yes , thank you . does everyone have a glass ?
yes we do .
let 's have a toast , to christmas .
merry christmas ! merry christmas ! merry christmas !
now , i don 't see anything abnormal in your mri ,
thank god .
and your blood work came back completely clear .
but what worries me are the memory tests that i sent you for .
you have sporadic memory impairment ,
and there is evidence of decline in your level of mental function .
so i think we should do a pet scan .
i know what a pet scan is .
what , in particular , would you be looking for ?
i want to see if the results are consistent with alzheimer 's disease .
it would be rare for someone as young as yourself
now last time i asked you to bring in a close relative .
i really didn 't think that would be necessary .
okay . but next time , for sure . okay ?
oh god , back to square one .
are we both here on the 17th ?
i don 't remember .
un-@@ huh , phil and di@@ ane were saying , they might come to town for the weekend .
how long are you going to , um , keep at that thing ?
till it 's clean .
john sweetheart , wake up .
what time is it ?
i need to talk to you .
i 've um , i 've got something wrong with me .
what are you talking about ?
i 've been seeing a neuro@@ logist .
you 've been seeing a neuro@@ logist , why ?
i assume that if i have the gene ,
i 'm afraid so .
and if they are carriers , what ,
i 'm afraid is 100 % o .
the kids will all be here for our anniversary .
i don 't think we should tell them .
not until we have the test results .
but we will by then , if i go in next week .
i wanna know as soon as possible .
what the hell is the god@@ damn elevator ?
i mean here we are in a major hospital , and they only have one elevator running ?
john it 's okay
we could 've taken the stairs by now
well , um , everybody .
what 's going on ?
oh boy .
are you guys gonna break up or ?
no , no , it 's nothing like that .
mom , are you sick ?
tom turned out negative and ly@@ dia didn 't want to know
baby how are you feeling ?
i 'm okay .
one good thing , at least i found out before the next i@@ ui session
they can be sure the babies will be okay .
anna where are you ? i 'm on my way to a lecture
i 'll have a regular with blue@@ berries and coconut please .
alice , where the hell were you ?
um , i went for a run .
you 've been gone for two hours , i was worried about you .
well , then i went to pin@@ k@@ berry .
yeah .
well i hope you enjoyed that
susan kir@@ by and her husband .
i 'm sorry i forgot . i have alzheimer 's .
i tex@@ ted you , i em@@ ailed you . there are ways to -
i had absolutely no idea where you were ,
i told you , i can 't when i 'm running
yes !
i hate that this is happening to me .
i hate it too .
i know , i know john .
i am ,
i might not be able to remember names or answer simple questions ,
i think you 're doing great recently .
relative to what ?
i wish i had cancer .
don 't say that .
no , i do . i mean it . i mean ,
people have cancer and they wear pink rib@@ bons for you
in 2013 , we completed exterior repairs ,
oh that 's good .
we also took away a lot of the old security doors .
residents are issued a brac@@ elet instead which keeps them from using elev@@ ators
i don 't know if you 've experienced this yet with your parents
i see
even distressed by the confusion they experienced from all the stimulation .
so we redefined activities to include
staff looks for opportunities to many meaningful connections with residents .
starting with knowing about the person
one woman who had worked as a nurse sat part of most days
that 's heart@@ breaking
we don 't have any restrictions on visiting times .
families and friends are welcome any hour , day or night .
it doesn 't look anyone is here today .
well , sunday is the day they usually come by .
what 's that ?
that 's a chair alarm ,
is she alright ?
it 's just a precautionary measure .
it 's all women .
we do have mainly female residents here , but there are men .
there is william over there .
they 're just not powerful enough to put me to sleep .
do you want to try lun@@ e@@ sta ?
what about ro@@ hypno@@ l ?
that 's very strong
hi alice , i am you and um , i have something very important to say to you .
and don 't tell anyone what you 're doing
oh i love it here .
me too .
can you believe that that was 30 years ?
don 't do that to me . oh my god .
oh that was a complicated time , huh ?
you were dealing with a lot , what was it ? about a year after ?
yeah , something like that .
i know i said this before
me too . we had a great time though .
yeah .
don 't you wish we had more of them ?
if you mean blow jobs on the beach ,
but , yeah , you know , all of it .
well you were relentless . you wanted everything . and all at once .
so i am , that 's how i like it .
anna 's the same way right ?
i like you the way you are ,
thank god you do .
this is so great you know ,
and we 're gonna do what ? drive around the country in an r@@ v ?
i don 't know . you can spend more time here . go to bu@@ tan .
well , i think our summer on the island is all the excitement i can handle .
okay , well you know what ?
hey when are you going to the conference ?
monday .
and when is u@@ y@@ dia coming
are we going running ?
yes , yes we are . i just have to go pee , i 'll be right back
you work all the time .
what i liked about it was how ... how big ,
yeah , the scope of it
it 's un@@ believable to me that you guys had lived through that .
you must 've known , you must 've known somebody that died from aids , right ?
yeah , everybody did .
we lost a lot of people .
but you think ,
you did the scenes in your acting class .
yeah . how did you know that ?
i don 't know , you must 've told me .
we must live , we must live .
there will come a time we all know .
why ? for what purpose ? they are all suffering ,
now we must live ,
tomorrow i will go off on my own , and i will teach ,
it 's autumn now , soon it will be winter ,
hey , you were amazing .
yes , so good .
often they 've managed to sustain
clearly alice 's memory is falling , but she 's still incredibly resource@@ ful .
thank you .
ii know you are discouraged .
but sometimes i see patients " plato " even at this point ,
alice .
will you be there ?
yes , i 'm looking forward to it .
i 'm going to be away on business in minnesota , so i worried .
are you sure this is a good idea ? considering the state she 's in ,
i think it would be great for her .
yeah , and i 'm sure it 's about it , but .
but what ?
have you thought about making it more personal ?
i don 't understand what you mean by " personal . "
you know , you 're not speaking to a room of scientists ,
you weren 't listening because that 's all there . that 's in the speech .
ok , don 't ask me then .
dun@@ no , then i won 't ask , then .
hey , mom , just give it one more shot , ok ?
i can 't because i have done it already .
i use this yellow ... ... yellow thing@@ y to mark it
got it , totally , just practice more .
do you know it takes me three days to write this ?
you can turn to it one more .
no , it took me three days .
sorry .
three days .
i think i 'll try to forget that just happened .
all my life , i have accumulated memories ,
the nic@@ ht i met my husband ,
as you can imagine , or as you know ,
who can take us seriously when we ane son@@ fan from who we once were ?
and like any disease ,
i know i 'm alive .
i have people i loved de@@ arly ,
i rail against myself for not being able to remember things ,
and please , do not think i am suffering ,
struggling to be part of things , to stay connected to who i once was .
so living the moment , i tell myself .
it 's really all i can do ,
and not beat myself up too much for ma@@ stering the art of losing
it will go , i know it will . it may be gone by tomorrow ,
thank you for this opportunity ,
it 's the mayo clinic , start up next spring ,
so you want us to move to
everything i know is here ,
are they coming ?
it 's just a two-@@ hour flight , we 'd see them as often as we do now .
i look forward to see you .
hey mama . it 's anna , mom .
i thought you were my sister .
it 's ol .
thank you so much for this .
how are you feeling ?
je@@ ow are you feeling ?
gi@@ ddy up .
mr. student council president ,

why would you call me that ?
luke somehow beat me in the election for president ,
not to be hyper@@ bol@@ ic , but humans are a decade away
you 're trying to tell me
you are dressed like a character
i don 't know what you 're talking about , okay ?
rain@@ er 's taking me to cab@@ o for the weekend .

my mom will be cool , but my dad is gonna fre@@ ak out .
well , i 'll tell him .

putting on your bedroom slip@@ per
thanks , dad . i 'll take my chances .
i gave cam 's fi@@ z@@ bo costume away .
oh , my god , he 's gonna kill everyone in the house .
the truck was here , and there were so many boxes ,
listen to me .
he 's not going to believe that this was an accident .
you can never , ever tell him .
he 's gonna know it 's missing .
i mean , he pulls it out for everything .
what ?
you 're cold ? i 'll go get you a blanket !
well , if he was going to get the pig a blanket ,
pig in a blanket ?

somebody please lower my s@@ plat@@ ter go@@ gg@@ les , boys ?
you heard him .
you do it .
you 're not the president of go@@ ggle lowering .
i would be if they took a vote .
what could cam have done ?
maybe he 's the one who 's having an affair .
i saw a list of clues in a magazine .
has he joined a gym or bought sexy new underwear recently ?
i think it 's sweet that you think
all right now , boys ,
we probably ought to do something .

better safe than sorry .
oh , i deserve some of the blame .
that 's class .

i think i felt enough for one day .
it 's possible i 've been electro@@ cu@@ ted one too many times .
you know , i learned something today .
i saw a man nearly die right in front of me .
and this is a constant reminder
it 's a lot to think about .
so i 'm not gonna .

it 's like you don 't realize
it 's like i 'm in a relationship
again .

why don 't you just hammer the nail in ?
because we are used to it .
we just ignore it , like the rain in my bedroom .

we 're on the front line .
and on the front line , we can 't afford to fuck up .
breaking up these drug cartels
i 'm all ears .
a lot of shooting
i 'm still checking the trajectory on that .
i mean , this guy , he probably dropped his piece
and that 's . .@@ - smart .

i 'll get .. i 'll get right back to you .
son of a bitch . break in my house ?
hi , sheriff . we need to talk .

but i got a problem i think you can help me with .
okay . what 's that ?
now , you know me . you know who i am .
everybody knows who you are .
someone stole a lot of money from me .
that i can live with .
but where you can help me is to figure out who killed my men .
first of all , i 'm gonna tell you ..
when we got there , they were already dead
you 're alive , aren 't you ?
u@@ h-@@ huh . look , i just don 't know .
i just don 't know how i can help you , mat@@ eo .
one of them was my son .
he shot sam@@ my , and ... and i tried to help him ,
look , we thought they were dead .
tell me about him
and then he shot me
i swear to god . i have no idea who these people are
unless you were planning on going somewhere .
the dea has taken over
work with them .
i 'll really make it worth your while .
well , uh ..
that sounds just fine , mr. pe@@ rez .
this guy stole $ 3 million from me .
and i 'll give you a he@@ fty finder 's fee .
and then you can just go on your merry way .
now that sounds like a good deal .
you gonna keep pointing that gun at me , partner ?
okay .
keep somebody on him .
jet 's find out where it takes us
that 's loc@@ o ! hell , no . come on .
cole

people
mat@@ eo daniel pe@@ rez was spotted
now , what 's a drug lord like mat@@ eo
and to top it all off
now , people ..
we 've had a guy on the inside of pe@@ rez 's gang
i don 't remember a god@@ damn thing
i 'm sure it 's just temporary .
no ! it 's not temporary .
i 'm in trouble here .
anything can get fixed .
you 'll be fine . everything will be fine .
i shot a cop . i killed him .
i know i shot other people , too . i just .. i just can 't remember !
i can 't remember a fucking thing !
i am gonna take care of you .

what did you do with it ?
what do you mean , what 'd i do with it ?

i get the picture .
you got cameras in the ba@@ thro@@ oms ?
now , sir ..
you know that is so illegal .
show me where you threw the trash .
i 'm gonna need to see footage from that camera .
i don 't think the dea 's gonna go that far .
you know who sam 's old man is ?
mat@@ eo pe@@ rez
jesus . what 'd you get yourself into ?
now , he paid me a private visit .
he wants me to find the guy and hand him over .
well , what are you gonna do ?
i 'm gonna find this son of a bitch and hand him over .
well , what if you don 't ?
you and i have seen enough dead bodies of people
now , you know god@@ damn well i didn 't kill sam .
i just need a little time to get out from underneath this .
all right .
i 'll tell you what i 'm gonna do .
i 'm gonna forget the dea .
i will shoot you .
it was all about the money , huh , chris ?
it 's always about the money , honey .
now get me the fucking money !
oh , baby .
you know , maybe we should just get married .
that way i can get you your green card .
things work out , maybe i 'll even get you a boo@@ b job .
aw , shit .
yeah , mike ?
now , you didn 't get this from me .
you don 't know him like i do .
ie 's a monster .
fuc@@ kin ' dam@@ ned rap@@ ist .

i 'm sure glad to see you .
you seriously fuc@@ ked up my day , son .
you took my money , and you left me with mat@@ eo pe@@ rez .
you dumb shit . we could have been partners on this .
god@@ damn ! i didn 't think i 'd see you again .
well , next time you better kill me all the way .
well , next time , i 'll remember that .
don 't strain yourself .
i could give two sh@@ its about the trouble you got yourself into .
or why you killed the kid !
kid ?
all i care about is the god@@ damn money !
now where the fuck is it ? !
that don 't look like $ 3 million , as@@ sh@@ ole !
now where 's the rest ? !
i might have put that money somewhere safe .
now , where exactly did you put it ? !
well , see , that 's the problem .
with all this head@@ -@@ trauma shit , i can 't remember .
i 'm not gonna ask you again .
yes , ma 'am .
i think we found our guy .
several traffic cam@@ s show a van blowing through red lights .
it 's now in the parking garage at the streamline bus station .
i ran the plates , and the van belongs to fe@@ rez .
why ? you now have the offer of command in writing .
yes , well , a liar 's word is worthless , even on paper .
you know i 'd love you just as much if you were a merchant captain ?
and you wouldn 't be gone for two years .
i won 't be gone two years .
she lost two men and still with her hull half empty .
well , they were from bed@@ ford and they didn 't have me aboard .
son of a bitch !
i will captain my own ship ..
a wh@@ aling ship .
up to them all we 'd ever have is a patch of dirt
what 's wrong with his words ?
he wanted things for his family , for himself .
ile was a dream@@ er , owen
dreamed of the sea and never got to sea with men like them .
at least he got to see his children born .
it 's all i know .
i 'll come back as quick as the sun is night , i swear .
please come back ... . promise me .
i already swore to you , now you want me to promise , too .
i promise .
son , a word with you .
to be a captain , you cannot be a friend , you are their superior .
never forget that , never let them forget that .
thank you , son .
your great-@@ grandfather and a few others created this industry .
without us , without you , the world plun@@ ges into darkness .
i hope to bring honor to the pol@@ l@@ ard family name , sir .
that won@@ d@@ rous monster of a mighty length ;
but , everlasting god , thou do@@ st ord@@ ain that we , poor fee@@ ble mort@@ als
o father , grant that your glorious light shine on these men ,
so that the white whales of nan@@ tuc@@ ket whale oil
so , what month is this ?
oh , late in the year , we were one of the last ships to go out .
which is why my friend bar@@ z@@ il@@ lai and i got a ber@@ th .
look , i was fourteen ... fourteen .
stand clear !
nice piece of work , mr. chase !
if we make cape ver@@ des in the next 2 weeks we 'll
corn , mr. chase ?
no , thank you , sir , never did have much of a taste for it .
that 's odd .
so , your father grew corn on cape cod .
that 's right , he did .
as you can imagine , i suddenly grew tired of eating it every day .
corn , ok@@ ra , beans , i believe ? before he went to jail .
are you familiar with this story , mr. joy ?
orphaned due to his father 's incarceration ?
well , we all have our paths to sea .
that 's a motive to not ask too many questions .
can 't have been easy though , yet ..
you had nan@@ tuc@@ ket 's great seaf@@ aring family to adopt you .
now , if the captain will excuse me , there are whale boats and watches to assign .
no , sir , not for me .
not a drop ?
no , sir , like i said , sometimes the fewer questions one asks , the better .
that 's a gorgeous girl , mr. joy .
no touching !
i always thought you were married anyway .
i am , and there she is .
well , that 's her nose anyway .
congratulations , ladies .
aye , sir .
there 'll be six men to a boat , first rules in the row , six bells sharp .
we 're not even east of hali@@ fax , sir .
what 's your name ?
coffin , henry coffin .
he 's the captain 's cousin , sir .
well , well , mr. coffin , do you think a whale knows it 's east of hali@@ fax ?
i don 't know who all of you are , or how you got here ,
that 's fine , i don 't give a damn , but we inter@@ red you for just one thing ...
and one thing only , and that is whale oil .
i intend to fill our 2000 barrels and be home as quickly as possible .
and even when the weather is fine and there are no whales , mr. coffin ,
we are two days behind .
you need to make up the time before we catch the east wind .
set stun@@ s 's .
bel@@ ay that , set stun@@ s 's .
get her off , mr. coffin , the captain wants speed !
aye , sir .
she might be old but she can still blow , boys !
sir , a squ@@ all on the star@@ board route , we need to shorten the sail immediately .
sir , we are headed into a storm of more than 8 knots
let it come , the men are soft from months on land , they
if we don 't shorten sail and bear off it 'll catch us on the beam .
chase , we will stand on .
mr. lawrence , hold our course .
holding course , sir .
we 'll lose half a day running like that .
best secure for heavy weather .
best prepare for weather , mr. bond , we 're headed into a squ@@ all .
we must fall off and run with it .
stand down , mr. chase .
mr. lawrence , hold your course .
holding course , sir .
shorten the sails mr. chase .
we need to cut those sails down !
turn the ship , head for land !
no , the damage is done !
it 's too late , it 's too god dam@@ ned late !
captain george pol@@ l@@ ard , the es@@ sex .
cap@@ iti@@ an cle@@ ment@@ e pel@@ ae@@ z , the santa maria .
would you buy a colleague a drink ?
same as always , george .
yes , captain
how far out ?
far enough for only a fool to go .
how far would that be ?
a thousand leagues along the equator ...
in offshore grounds .
were there whales there ?
more than you 've ever dream@@ t .
sir , what are you doing ?
where is he ?
it could be duci@@ e island .
without a map , compass or quad@@ rant there 's no way to be certain .
we will keep fires going night and day ,
this is what i wanted you to see .
they 've been here a long time , for no doubt ..
waiting for a ship .
but no ship came .
no ship is going to come .
if we stay , we die .
how long do you think it would take to trust the birds
it 's a privilege to know the moment of one 's death in advance .
and to be able to prepare for it ..
a curse to be so far from home ...
or a chance to say good@@ b@@ yes , without a chance to make peace ...
or a chance to settle scores .
but alas , at least those are settled between us
captain of what ?
it was as if owen chase himself had spoken .
he told them the truth .
cap '@@ n pol@@ l@@ ard 's conscience was clear ..
but the inquiry was a sham .
over the white whale .. they never found it .
he ran a second ship ag@@ round off of hawaii ..
twice cursed .
then take over our planets .
horrors that you remember
it 's all blank . my life .
you 're supposed to take the form
perhaps this is a mercy
freeing you to do what all k@@ ree must .
put your people 's needs before your own .
we 've given you a great gift .
the chance to fight for the good of all k@@ ree .
i want to serve .
then master yourself .
what was given can be taken away .
i won 't let you down .
we 'll know soon enough .
you have a mission .
serve well , and with honor .
this can 't be good .
we slip in , we locate so@@ h-@@ lar@@ r ..
and we get out , leaving them none the wis@@ er .
the tor@@ fan populace .
we are not to interfere with them ,
nothing compromises the security of our mission .
proceed with caution .
follow protocol before extracting him .
this is a dangerous mission .
we must all be ready to join the collective
for the good of all k@@ ree !
vers , track so@@ h-@@ lar@@ r 's beacon .
do you read me ? does anybody copy ?
repeat .
his beacon 's coming from that temple . let 's move .
no . this is a perfect spot for an ambush .
only one way in , only one way out .
we can get past the locals .
we don 't know if they are locals .
too risky .
you don 't have to go with me . i 'll go alone .
no , you won 't .
right . we keep a close radius .
" pe@@ ga@@ sus . dr. wend@@ y law@@ son . " that 's her .
do you hear that , too ?
do we have her location ?
got it .
now track law@@ son until we find the energy signature .
interesting .
hold on .
go back right before this . go back .
that 's no mic , law@@ son .
this is it . now let me see where you 're headed .
that 's right . look at the coordinates .
roo@@ kie ! go talk to the rent-@@ a-@@ cop .
did you call this in ?
beacon activated .
excuse me , miss .
you know anything about a lady blowing a hole
witness says she was dressed for laser tag .
yeah , i think she went that way .
i 'd like to ask you some questions .
maybe give you the 411 on the late-@@ night drop box .
could i see some identification , please ?
vers . k@@ ree star@@ force .
we don 't carry our identification on little cards .
vers ?
this is gonna get a little awkward , but i gotta ask .
you think i 'm one of those green things .
can 't be too careful .
you are looking at 100 % red-@@ blo@@ o@@ ded earth man .
i 'm afraid i 'm gonna need proof .
we talking cheek swa@@ b or urine sample ?
no . the dna would match .
want my a@@ ol password ?
they believe that she developed
light-@@ speed engine ?
gotta admit , that 's not the cra@@ zi@@ est thing i 've heard today .
well , it 's still early .
and you , what do you want ?
i 'm gu@@ essing that 's not standard k@@ ree operating procedure .
well , i won 't tell your boss if you don 't tell mine .
ron@@ an .
the acc@@ users completed their operation ...
it was a trap
give us their location .
we 'll take care of the terrorist threat .
by bombing them out of the galaxy ?
no , we 'll handle this .
excuse me , i 'm looking for maria ram@@ be@@ au .
a@@ unti@@ e carol ?
mom , it 's a@@ unti@@ e carol !
i knew it ! everyone said you were dead !
but we knew they were lying .
i 'm not really who you think i am .
that is the cra@@ zi@@ est shit i ever heard .
green transforming aliens ? there 's no such thing .
you are absolutely right , young lady .
there is no such thing .
that system is f@@ alli@@ ble , as we 've learned .
okay , then let 's do this .
who do i see when i commune with the supreme intelligence ?
the person you most admire and respect , i 'd guess .
but you would never tell me who .
and what is your earliest memory of hal@@ a ?
the transfusion .
blue blood running through my veins .
whose blood ?
that 's my blood that 's cour@@ sing through her veins .
what have you done with her ?
you 're too late .
she knows ?
come at once .
for the good of all k@@ ree , commander ,
passing 500 and climbing .
you know , you really shouldn 't have that thing on your lap .
our little alliance with you is ten@@ uous at best .
and as long as he continues to fre@@ ak you out
yeah , i 'm gonna keep giving him
can i ask you something ?
do you just turn into anything you want ?
well , i have to see it first .
can you all do it ?
buck@@ le up , folks .
is this normal , like , space turbulence ?
pretty much .
locking in on coordinate grid .
where is it ?
it 's here . it 's gotta be here .
well , is it in front of all that nothing , or behind it ?
what did you do to your uniform ?
they got in her head . just like we thought .
the supreme intelligence will set her straight .
you can see they 're not soldiers .
let ' em go . you can have me .
and the core ?
you lied to me .
i made you the best version of yourself .
what 's given can be taken away .
back here ! move , move !
get over here . get down !
let 's go ! go , move !
there she is .
which you will not be celebrating
shel@@ don , we 've been through this .
i 'm taking penny .
afraid not . do you recognize this ?
not the roommate agreement .
indeed , the roommate agreement .
i call your attention to the friendship rider
" number 37 : in the event one friend is ever invited
you actually put that in an agreement ?
yeah . we also put in what happens
he can 't kill me , even if i turn .
is there anything in there about if one of you gets a girlfriend ?
yeah . he thinks i betrayed him .
i mean , come on . what would you guys do if you were me ?
i 'd take shel@@ don to switzerland .
seriously ?
absolutely .
and i 'd leave him there .
what the hell is that ?
uh , let 's see .
30 pieces of silver@@ ware .
so just , like , keep that in mind when you 're in there .
yeah , just think , " little boys , little boys . "
hello .
oh , hey . shel@@ don . we 're kind of in the middle of something .
oh , i won 't be a moment . i just need to grab a book
shel@@ don , come home !
they don 't want to have your baby !
i don 't know what you 're talking about .
oh@@ -@@ oh , dear , i think i got something in my eye .
my piercing , blue eye .
shel@@ don !
fine .
i 've also never had a cavity and i don 't have asthma ..
now , remember , do not bring up any baby stuff , all right ?
not me not wanting one , not you having one with z@@ ack .
got it .
and if he brings it up , change the subject
i got it .
but not the corn@@ hus@@ kers . do not discuss the corn@@ hus@@ kers .
is that a sports team ?
never mind , you 're good .
daddy !
hi . hey . slu@@ gger .
hey . wy@@ att .
leonard .
hey , that 's a hell of a hand@@ shake .
ah , well , you know , i 've been taking vitamins .
dad , uh , come on in , sit down .
can i get you something to drink ? maybe a beer ?
sure , if you 're having one .
okay .
and why wouldn 't you , since you 're not pregnant ?
leonard wants to have a baby with my ex-@@ boyfriend z@@ ack .
how would you say it ?
uh , same words , just less angry .
well , i don 't know about los angeles ,
it 's strange here , too , and we have a bak@@ ery for dogs .
and you 're okay with this ?
i support my husband .
thank you .
but , you know , if you think differently ,
are you guys ready for the most intense experience of your life ?
yes .
definitely .
not to bra@@ g , but i 'm an astronaut ,
can be pretty scary .
please , i 'm , like , 90 pounds .
i 'm weigh@@ tless every time i hold more than three balloons .
okay , i just need you guys to sign these waivers ,
there are a lot of pages here .
is this a waiver or a screenplay you 've been working on ?
i 'm sure it 's just bo@@ il@@ er@@ plate .
absolutely . it 's to protect us in case of injury .
it says , " or death . "
done .
where are the changing rooms ?
dressing rooms are in the back .
no pe@@ e@@ king .
here you go .
okay . should we go get changed ?
what am i doing ?
if you don 't want to do this ,
to prove to howard that he doesn 't know me as well
looks like he does .
unless i do it and then he doesn 't .
why not just be honest ?
you 're right .
i should be honest .
you owe me $ 3,000 for those plane tickets to l@@ n@@ dia !
that was a long run .
yeah . well , i was in the zone .
you know , and then in a din@@ er
are you avoiding me ?
well , i took a nap next to hot dog on a stick .
what do you think ?
i think you 're mad at me and leonard ,
why would i be mad at myself ?
a couple of questions
have you seen any of these men ?
sor@@ ry@@ .i don 't recognize any of them
pull over up there .
we 're going to have to inspect your car .
but i thought you said
now pull over .
do you want some water ?
or do you want to tell me where michael sco@@ field is ?
i don 't know where he is .
you know , from the first day you started here .
i guess i just know a con when i see one , huh ?
maybe you 'll get to be employee of the month .
i 'm waiting .
there 's been a change in venue .
oh , well , well , well .
i finally get to talk to the brains of the outfit .
we 're at the plaza de fran@@ cia .
so you 're thinking public place , safety in numbers ,
i 'm thinking public place , wanted men , police ,
you don 't want to help , then don 't .
get out@@ ta here sho@@ o fly
then it 's home , sweet home .
this is my house
get out
he 's gonna get us out of here .
in between jobs .
oh@@ . sorry to hear that .
yeah , we 've all been there .
i 'm sure something will come up before long .
i 'm hoping it 's right around the corner .
here .
you won 't be needing this anymore .
what 's this for ?
you 're gonna give me some real information on michael sco@@ field .
or it 's gonna be your funeral .
i don 't know where he is .
i don 't know how to reach him , i swear .
i take offense , patron .
i 've had many foot-@@ wash@@ ers .
many men have come in with sheep 's clothing ,
i am not trying to hurt you . i am trying to save you .
save me ?
i 'm gonna die here .
your life is in jeopardy just being with me .
not necessarily .
as i was being escorted back inside today , one of the guards
if a guard spoke to you , he was lying .
it 's impossible to get out .
maybe you 've been too busy dying to notice ,
i found this in his pocket .
would you care
i 've got no idea what it is .
it 's from the gift ship .
it 's plastic .
now , if you 'll excuse us .
what ?
stay where you are .
why ? where is your identification ?
hey , come on , guys , focus .
oh , mighty nicolas cage tree ,
oh , lucy 's free after all .
see ya .
hey , hey , hey , you can 't leave .
we just started .
you 're right , i should finish the game .
i take my pl@@ us-@@ one long sword ,
i 'm dead , i 've got a date with a girl .
bye .
we 'll be fine , watch .
suddenly , a spectral shape
i 'm very happy you were able to hang out tonight .
me , too .
not that it 's up to you to make me happy .
sorry . i-i 'm just saying , if you ever wanted
sweet again , but i think that might be a little weird
yeah , i get that .
i just wouldn 't forgive myself if i didn 't ask .
but never worry if you 're gonna be okay , ly@@ net@@ te .
you will . you are the exact kind of woman
you 're welcome .
oh , hey , i 'm off on friday ,
uh , bad news . uh , i checked the weather up there .
if looks like rain for this weekend .
so ? i wasn 't seeing uss spending a lot of time outdoors .
i think we have a little ...
" horizontal " to catch up on .
it 's kind of been a while , hasn 't it ?
well , i guess , with , uh , work and everything .
a cabin , the rain ..
a o@@ ed .
it 's gonna be a good weekend .
yes , ly@@ net@@ te had tried hard
hey , greg@@ g .
but sometimes , the low road was easier to find .
carlos sol@@ is was used to sitting in a position of power ,
at the head of a power lunch ...
or at the helm of a powerful company .
but now that carlos sol@@ is had started a new career ,
so .. what do you think of my new office ?
aw , that 's so sweet .
you 're lying to spare your daddy 's feelings .
seriously , . honey , there 's a guy down at the department store
" sp@@ ru@@ ce it up " ?
ga@@ by , we can barely keep the lights on here .
our budget is tiny , and every cent goes towards
okay , okay . save it for the pamphlet .
all i 'm saying is , if i was an ad@@ dict ,
okay , behave . listen to your daddy .
i 'll see you tonight .
wh@@ oa , wh@@ oa , wh@@ oa ! i can 't take the girls to school .
you always take them .
'@@ cause you can 't even make a turkey sandwich .
well , thank goodness i have the most talented partner .
now come on . we 're wasting time .
let 's get ham@@ mering .
seriously ? you 're telling me
i 've just seen too many cases
not my clients , of course .
well , i just think our society 's gotten too soft .
we need a powerful deterrent to stop these killers .
you do realize you 're not on trial
but not about a murder .
tell me what 's going on , or i 'm walking out of this house .
you 're gonna need to let me think about it .
i don 't believe this .
my , uh , my first husband kept secrets from me ,
i 'm not going down this road again .
ga@@ by , why is there an old lady
do you have any idea who that is ?
i think my generic reference to her as " old lady "
she 's dor@@ is ham@@ mond ,
ring any bells ?
bill ham@@ mond 's widow ?
guy made a killing in private equity .
why is she here ?
isn 't it lovely . carlos ?
yeah , it 's great .
oh , i almost had a heart attack when i saw the price .
i guess i just have to get comfortable
that 's right , and tomorrow when the new fall line comes in ,
so , carlos ..
what is it you do ?
i ... work for a nonprofit that helps recovering addicts .
oh , i 'm sorry .
was carlos talking about his charity ?
good thing we weren 't operating heavy machinery ,
you 'll have to excuse my wife .
not the biggest fan of what i do .
oh , that 's silly .
philanthropy is very important .
my bill gave generously to many worthy causes .
okay , if we 're gonna keep talking about charity ,
boy , bill left quite a legacy .
all right . you know what ? will you just sit down and be quiet ?
did you check your blood sugar ?
uh , 56 , but i don 't have , uh , any juice .
i just have , uh , half a can of diet soda , so
oh , damn it . look at you .
what ?
you look amazing .
you were on a date , weren 't you ?
i made you come here in the middle of a date .
no , no , no , you know what ? actually ,
all your colleagues are showing some kind of leadership potential .
grey and a@@ very , they 're on clinical trials ,
they have a plan .
i was just wondering if you had a
sorry ?
yeah , i 'm gonna bring over about a dozen kids from africa
huh . sounds pretty ambitious .
well , i 'm am ambitious guy .
also sounds like you just pulled that out@@ ta your butt .
i mean , they 're incredible sur@@ ger@@ ies ... on kids .
oh , okay . so it 's coming out of my budget ?
well , i 'm saying , if i do all the logistical cra@@ p ,
i mean , it 's worth ...
nothing .
that 's what it 's worth . no , no .
i 'm sorry .
right . i should 've known what you 'd say .
no , no , no . you don 't get to do that .
you don 't get to ask me to fund a plan this half-@@ assed
come on .
i mean , yeah , there are people that can do this sort of thing ,
mrs. pul@@ cher .
is it two hours already ?
it seems like i saw your slack jaw a minute ago .
or you could do something good with the money .
donate it to a good cause , help someone out .
or put it to getting you a medical degree .
mrs. pul@@ cher ,
you as@@ kin ' me for money ?
i need at least 100 grand to get things started .
oh , my god .
take it somewhere else , sally stru@@ thers ,
overall , adel@@ e scored a 23 , which is a marked decline
so she 's definitely a lot worse than we thought .
well , the upside is , she gets in the trial .
but she 's declining so fast .
i know .
why can 't we just give her the medicine on the side
no . the f.@@ d.@@ a. is gonna be on us harder than ever .
don 't think i haven 't thought about it .
she 's in heart failure .
she 's gotta go back on the vent .
she needs surgery now ?
well , as soon as possible .
so should i get her pre@@ pped ?
yeah , looks like i 'm stuck with you , too , huh ?
are you ready to go back ?
one more lap .
what , did you lose a bet ?
she 's my new physical therapist
whose charts are those ?
al@@ t@@ man 's . she 's being ridiculous .
i haven 't seen a cardi@@ o surgery in a month .
so you stole her charts ?
yes , i stole her charts ,
grey , sit . i need the resistance .
she 's worse than we thought .
but at least she 's gonna get in the trial .
okay , see ? ! see ? ! i should be on this .
how do i even have a shot at chief resident
alex , you didn 't . you 're gonna be fired .
i 'm gonna be chief resident .
yeah , not if you don 't work here anymore .
he solicited a patient for money .
no , my african kid thing .
it 's against so many rules .
who cares ? the old ha@@ g could die ,
but instead , she 'll probably leave it to her cats ,
uh , hey , everybody . off . now .
cal@@ lie .
i did four l@@ aps today .
sofia needs surgery .
what ?
today . now . she has weakness in her left ventric@@ le .
not ell@@ is .
it 's me@@ red@@ ith . i 'm her daughter .
ell@@ is is gone . she died .
please give me back my husband .
please ...
give me back my husband .
i mean , what am i supposed to say .
" sorry . never mind . lack of funds .
keep your dying kids where they are " ?
well , yeah .
no . you say " i 'll pay you when you get here .
keep the receipt . send me the bill . "
right now they 're eating $ 8 airport ham@@ bur@@ gers
great .
maybe you can help me find a clear route to the cia drop-@@ off .
looks like they 're doing some serious renovations down here .
listen to me carefully , leon .
your mission has been abor@@ ted .
the u. s. is going to pull out of the country .
what ? i just got here .
after taking me off fur@@ l@@ ough and sending me to this
what the hell ?
washington and the government there have decided to go their separate ways .
everyone has to leave , not just embassy staff
i don 't give a damn about the politics .
if we don 't stop them now ,
do you really wanna see that ?
this is a war and things are different .
no one can do anything without backup from the american government .
not even you .
well then , i guess my only option is to
leon !
she can tell them i got lost and missed my flight .
better hurry up and get this done .
i need some breakfast .
sca@@ rec@@ row .
i 'm the tin man . can you talk ?
i don 't want to cause any more trouble .
it 's time to say goodbye .
wait .
you know , i didn 't really care about independence .
all i wanted was to have fun with you and my friends .
and ..
i was looking forward to showing you america .
trust me ,
the person who released the pl@@ aga .
just as i thought , you haven 't a clue .
i am the president of this country .
so that 's what ada meant .
he is an enemy of the state . kill him !
creatures broke through
open fire !
cease fire . cease fire .
help me !
help !
what will you gain by killing me ?
have you thought this through ?
who will lead the country once you gain independence ?
you ?
i have no intention of taking advice
in case you 're interested ,
have been happening in the world .
we don 't have time to fight amongst ourselves
shut up !
oh , great . it just keeps getting better .
we have to go .
s@@ vet@@ lan@@ a !
a bio@@ hazard release has been detected .
okay , this is only a dr@@ y-@@ run , and it 's the first of many .
won 't be perfect , but once we start ,
agreed ?
okay .
let 's go .
ye@@ p .
it makes a weird kind of sense .
if you plan on sa@@ wing a person in half ,
when you take the stage and all eyes are on you ,
three days ago , i received a call
a consult was requested for a 35-@@ year-old male patient
you only want them to see the magic .
seconded .
traditionally , a tumor like this
there 's got to be something better than that .
torres thought so , too .
she had a better idea .
nobody was listening to each other .
dani@@ elle hit her trick too soon ,
are you kidding ? we were in the final round !
we were about to qualify for nationals !
slight ten@@ derness to the abdomen ,
oh , my god . dan@@ i , are you okay ? !
everything hurts .
i 'll grab it if you let me watch .
the bon@@ e-@@ graft retrieval .
sorry , we 're a military hospital .
i-i see mostly tra@@ u@@ ma@@ -related pat@@ ch@@ -up jobs .
you have a reputation for a much more refined approach .
my reputation ? i have a reputation ?
i goog@@ led you .
i mean , i goog@@ led all of you .
everyone 's really excited about the surgery .
we don 't get a lot of chances
um , you know what ? yeah . sure .
you can watch .
thank you .
could she fli@@ rt any harder ?
what ? nobody 's fli@@ r@@ ting with anybody .
oh , come on . " i goog@@ led you " ?
she was totally fli@@ r@@ ting . so were you .
i was not ! what did i even say ?
you didn 't have to say anything .
all of this .. is a fli@@ rt .
i 'm gonna need you to be still .
i mean , she barely even looks hurt
max@@ ine scre@@ wed us .
dani@@ elle 's the one who threw us off .
she didn 't put her weight in her heel
what ? are you trying to break it more ?
i am so over them .
we have worked too hard and sacrificed too much
they are out .
down .
that girl is the reason i hated high school .
what a power trip .
she can 't just kick somebody off the team .
are you kidding me ? she 's the power center here .
she 's cheer captain and squad leader .
what 's the difference ?
you see the way they all look at her .
she 's the top of the social food chain .
she calls all the shots , decides who 's in , who 's out .
she says jump , they ask , " off which bridge ? "
d-@@ do you need something ?
yeah , i-i need you .
where the hell is mitchell ?
i think you should call it . h-@@ he 's been down a long time .
shut up . just shut up , please .
i think i got a faint pulse .
i think that 's your pulse you 're feeling .
i got to open him up now . if i don 't , he 's dead .
again , i 'm not gonna allow you
i 've got no way to dock the leg .
we don 't have a fall@@ back plan here .
okay , i need you to hear me .
this is not a matter of confidence , okay ?
it 's not me . it is the bone .
i am saying that , with the pel@@ vis that i have left ,
well , you better do something .
she 's right . look , if we stop now ,
he 's not gonna survive the night .
yes . the young lad there .
i will . thank you .
you should have a cloak for a day like this .
er@@ am@@ cis will take care of me .
we are to be married soon .
good-@@ bye .
come on , a decent wage .
make your family proud .
food , shelter . who will join us ?
go and wake up the other farms !
get them down here ! we need more hands !
we need more men now !
wake them up !
go and get the smith brothers first .
we lose the barn , we lose everything
look sharp , men , the farmer 's here .
mr. oak , is that you ?
perhaps you want a shepherd , ma 'am ?
i owe you an immense debt , mr. oak .
you are dismissed .
get out while you can , if i were you .
now you 've all met our new shepherd , mr. oak .
you understand your duties , mr. oak ?
if i don 't , i 'll ask , ma 'am .
he 's rich , he 's handsome . he sends the local girls mad .
the taylor sisters worked on him for two years .
jane per@@ kins spent 20 on new clothes
it 's said , when he was young , his sweetheart jil@@ ted him .
people always say that .
in rejecting you , perhaps ?
i 've long given up thinking of that .
or wishing it , either .
but i will say this .
leading on a man you don 't care for is beneath you .
i cannot allow a man to criticize my private conduct .
you will please leave the farm at the end of the week .
i 'd prefer to go at once .
then go . i never want to see your face again .
very well , miss ever@@ den@@ e .
wh@@ oa , there we are . there .
what 's wrong with them ?
they broke fence and ate the young clo@@ ver .
makes their stom@@ achs swell .
what can we do now
you mean they 're all going to die ?
i hope i didn 't star@@ tle you .
we 've got hit@@ ched together somehow .
here , allow me .
no . no . please , let me do it myself .
if you lift your foot for a moment .
please don 't stare
i don 't think i 've ever seen a face as beautiful as yours .
you shouldn 't be here . please let me have the lamp .
a mighty impressive harvest this looks like .
miss ,
sergeant francis tro@@ y .
noble blood , full of promise . very sharp and trim .
well-@@ educated .
there was good things expected of him .
i threw it all in to be a soldier
i 'm going to tell him to leave .
i must absolutely insist that you leave at this very moment .
i can 't .
will you follow me , please ?
what ang@@ ers you , exactly ?
i 'm quite happy to walk by myself .
you should have nothing to do with him .
he 's not good enough for you .
he 's a perfectly decent man .
that 's not what i believe
frank , perhaps we ought to .. no .
darling , it 's our wedding celebration .
it will not rain tonight . my wife forbids it .
now if you 'll excuse me .
friends !
one more thing
the finest bottles of french bran@@ dy ,
cheers ! to your health !
that 's a great responsibility , sir .
hon@@ sense .
no reason why a man of your ability
and why shouldn 't there be stronger links
a share of my profits .
miss ever@@ den@@ e needs me here .
and her farm will have priority .
i 'd still need miss ever@@ den@@ e 's permission .
but , of course .
of course , i wouldn 't dare do anything
georgi@@ e !
had to go all the way to nor@@ com@@ be hill
you pleased ?
yes , sir , very much .
you will , sir .
hey , georgi@@ e .
come on . come on .
gabriel , you 're getting on in the world .
of course you must accept the offer .
only with your approval .
if i lose the farm , there may be no future
you know where my loyalty lies .
you 're a man of great talent , it 's only natural using it right .
yes . very much .
which is it ? like or respect ?
it is difficult for a woman to define her feelings
if you worry about a lack of passion on your part ,
don 't mind .
when must you give your answer ?
by christmas .
it 's a terrible responsibility .
i hold that man 's future in my hands .
his san@@ ity , too , perhaps .
could you care for him ?
you may suppose love is wanting
why are you asking me ?
i need someone who 's objective .
well , i accepted you , han .
yes , thank you . you make my heart sing .
woo !
hurts me still .
that was like watching someone club a baby seal .
why wouldn 't you just say yes to his friend request ?
because i never check facebook , why would i ?
so some girl i worked at a movie theater with in 2005
maybe someone just post on your wall .
you have an air conditioner that works ?
oh , it works .
that 's like an a.@@ c. that just had sal@@ ami .
there 's more sal@@ ami where that came from .
and my feet hurt .
i mean , i can 't believe it .
didn 't you see me crying ?
lots of people cry at goodwill .
you go to france , you eat sn@@ ails . you come here , you cry .
that 's odd , you didn 't even react .
you need to react when people cry .
i did , i rolled my eyes .
look , eventually , you 'll learn to do that on the inside .
okay , well , just f@@ yi ,
are your girl@@ friends black drag queens ?
oh , awesome strokes tee .
i went to this concert , but i couldn 't afford the shirt .
oh , we 're done with me .
i went to see them on this tour the summer after my jum@@ ior year .
it was a really warm night , and i s@@ nuc@@ k out of the house ,
whatever .
and what ?
what , did something great happen the night you got the t ?
look at me , does it look like something great ever happens ?
hey , cute tee . had my eye on it .
that 's not me , that 's the law of the ' will .
yeah , you better walk away .
that was intense .
just another wednesday at the ' will .
you said to look in things , right ?
max , look . on my first try !
o@@ oh , s@@ lick . whoever hid those is gonna be pis@@ sed .
quality check .
fabric stur@@ dy , no mysterious cro@@ tch sta@@ ins ,
and look , they 're designer .
summer 2009 . $ 350 .
and for me today ...
$ 5 . that 's a reduction i like .
these are from the gentleman with a sweet note ,
same face , no sound .
oh , my god .
i can 't believe it , it 's the girl from the ' will .
i got your back , gir@@ -@@ r-@@ r .
what is up with that ?
i don 't know , man , i 'm just used to it .
that 's what you 'd sound like , if you talked .
i agree with you , by the way .
everything you say is right , max .
thank you , chest@@ nut .
you should kill her .
chest@@ nut ! i can 't do that .
it 'll be easy . we could kill her and eat her .
chest@@ nut !
all right , buddy , here 's your spot .
come on , do your business .
how could there be ? !
with these constant interrup@@ tions .
i love him , but if he 's broken , let 's not get a new one .
what are you doing ? it 's time to go .
i 'm not going to work today .
and would you like to know why ?
ah , you 're upset because you spent the whole night working
like a big old baby .
call me if you need anything .
hmm , it would .
okay , back to " emily or cin@@ nam@@ on " "
that nag@@ ging tone is helping my anxiety , yeah .
but if you could maybe just go ten percent less shr@@ ill ,
i 'm sorry , but you know we agreed
there you go , perfect .
shel@@ don , stop it , i 'm not kidding .
take the cap off , and put the notebook away .
but after months of struggling , i 'm finally making progress .
you don 't need to drive yourself crazy in order to be productive .
or do i , hmm ?
sir isaac newton wrote his princip@@ ia
that 's not true .
yeah , well , maybe it is , maybe it isn 't .
sophie , are those all your brid@@ al magazines ?
that 's only half .
come on , ole@@ g !
look , if those are too heavy , how are you going to be able
wedding donkey ?
my excitement level for this wedding just sky@@ rocke@@ ted .
relax , sophie .
