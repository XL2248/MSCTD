he wanted to become better faster .

i 'm scared to touch you !

that 's how you stay alive .
when it hurts so much you can 't breathe
miranda .
by remembering that one day ,
the trick was so shocking
i , uh , don 't think it 's working .
oh , well , i mean ,
you just move your ... yeah .
.... arm around to keep it going .
i should probably get going .
mother 's waiting in the truck .
.. and she 's patient until she isn 't .
oh , and i 've got to get to work , too ,
it 's pretty hard to concentrate with all the bathroom crying
have a good one .
i will .
wow . those are nice .
yeah , they were on the front porch .
they 're from a mystery admi@@ rer .
the card says , " you don 't know your power . "
yeah , don 't ask who they 're from ,
what happened to your arm ?
oh , i am winding an old watch
oh . that 's pretty uneven . you gave her this awesome swing .
man , where did mom find a guy as sweet as you ?
actually , she hit me with her car
we may not get women ,
we may not hook up with women ,
i think it was clear when i said that .
so , what 's with this whole " going out early " thing .
well , it 's been forever since we 've had a dat@@ e-@@ night out ,
u@@ gh , pathetic .
okay , we get to say that , not you .
no , no , no , it 's dy@@ lan .

the first part 's true .
well , actually , we have plans .
aw , but now you have better plans .

i didn 't know that real humans could have these dimensions .
thanks .
thank you .
i seem to have dropped my spare hotel key .
phil
no need to call whoever this phil is .
you 're in no danger .
this key is to room 422 at the ram@@ ada down the street .
slip out when you can .
i 'll pre-@@ disable the smoke detectors
for the past several valentine 's ,
this hotel has a very short memory
claire , you have to finish signing these contracts .
hey , phil .
phil ? no .
name 's c@@ live , friend .
say , maybe you could take over here for a bit .
i 'll make sure the boss lady 's back in one piece
hi , phil .
it 's c@@ live , actually .
apparently they have a thing like how you and your sister
oh . uh , claire , your 2 : 00 is here
phil , look , i really appreciate this . i do .
it 's just that
turns out my admi@@ rer
i may have a sad love life , but i don 't need my mommy
and if you really want to give me some confidence ,
first of all , i didn 't give you those flowers .
second of all , there is a picture of you .
where is it ?
yes , hello .
i 've got a meeting .
ben , you 're gonna finish the contract stuff .
margaret , you 're gonna take alex .
you 're gonna find out who 's using our account for flowers , okay ?
phil , honey ,
do i know that guy in the cloak ?
ah , hinge specialist . you might 've seen him around .
he 's the guy for off@@ beat swi@@ vels
i 've got it all planned .
this whole c@@ live thing wasn 't even necessary .
claire was taking me out to dinner all along .
romance strong as ever .
margaret , get a reservation
i 've got too much going on to even think about it .
wer@@ ner is great .
you know , he 's a rich musician ,
well , um ...
... this has been fun , but we should , uh ...
you 're not going anywhere , car@@ rot bottom .
oh , my god . is that rain@@ er ?
why is he with another woman ?
that sounds che@@ at-@@ y .
hey . margaret said you keep the phone records .
why ? what do you need them for ?
i 'm still trying to find out who sent me those flowers .
you keep them in here ?
no , don 't .
don 't .
ben , why do you have this photo of me in your desk drawer ?
who would bully you ?
so , i heard there was going to be this big ice-@@ skating party .
oh , my god . it 's already gotten , like , eight likes .
despite our failure in russia ,
they believe hassan had been working with this man ,
he 's a french national who 's been trading illegal arms
victor has recently stepped up his game into the nuclear arena
for years , he 's worked hand in hand with his brother , david .
there were reports of a power struggle between the two .
david didn 't want his brother
later he was almost captured by police ,
oh , that poor lady . does anyone know if she 's ok ?
she 's fine .
if mar@@ quez finds those plans and sells them to az@@ ar ... boom !
our mission ? take down mar@@ quez before he can locate the plans .
do we know his whereabouts ?
n@@ sa believes he 's headed to berlin to meet with az@@ ar .
yes ! love berlin .
christina , you 'll take it .
we also have intel from mi@@ 6 .
that doesn 't give me the right to disseminate it freely .
come on . look , the letter was found in bern@@ ade@@ tte 's closet .
doesn 't that count for something ?
are you pointing out that california
yeah , obviously .
well played .
sometimes i don 't give you enough credit , penny .
well , put your mind at ease .
i 'm here to make sure your dinner party
now , the first thing we need is a theme .
i 'm thinking ...
ah , turn@@ -of-@@ the-@@ century mou@@ lin rouge .
i 'm thinking you need a te@@ sto@@ sterone patch .
penny and i just want to do something low-@@ key .
you know , cock@@ tails ,
so your theme is
hate to miss that .
hey , where have you been ?
oh , leonard .
if i was prone to sar@@ cas@@ m ,
one , two , three , four , five ,
i meant , " gol@@ ly , shel@@ don ,
they made me reveal confidential information
what information ?
i can 't tell you that .
i am bound by closet
well , come on , we won 't tell anyone .
que ser@@ a . that 's racing , i guess .
it 's bad luck for the pun@@ ters that they lose their money .
fucking hell !
ru@@ uck !
nathan , how are you going ?
i 'm alright . i 've just ... . just got a flat .
oh , yeah . need a hand ?
nah , all good . i got it .
no worries at all , mate .
she 's given up on your whole pathetic act .
do you know that you 're the la ..
enough .
why don 't you and your dead@@ beat husband
jack , you 're my brother .
i can 't just stand by and watch this happen .
are you done ?
have you made that call ?
what you 're talking about is a one-way street . you understand ?
once you start , there is no going back .
she 's had fair warning .
she knew the consequences and she did it anyway .
so fuck her .
you want my money or not ?
do you have that sort of cash just lying around ?
about . $ 250,000 .
quarter of a million dollars .
and you just forgot about it ?
we didn 't have to kill her , did we ?
what are you talking about ? !
we could have used that money to pay bruce .
by the time i found it , we were already committed .
very convenient .
believe me , there is nothing convenient
hey .
i 'm sick and tired of having barely enough .
i want more .
so should you .
i 'm off
maybe .
your business is your own .
as long as we 're square .
you got some proof for me ?
or am i supposed to just take your word ?
what , you don 't trust me anymore ?
i 'd have thought you 'd be glad to be rid of her .
answer to all your problems .
despite what you think ,
too much .
well , you 've got a crazy way of showing it .
nobody makes a fool out of me .
it 's gone .
i don 't i@@ ke the sound of that .
alice .
you wouldn 't be playing games with me , would you , jack ?
wh@@ ac
at the safety deposit box at the bank .
ad me worried for a moment .
what time shall i come back tomorrow
jet 's make it 200 .
jack , all this talk of boo@@ ze has got me quite thirsty .
you wouldn 't know of any good bars in the area , would you ?
shit .
hi , bruce .
where 's lucy ?
oh , she hasn 't showed up for work yet .
you know why i 'm here ?
i 'm here on police business .
you know anything about a crash ?
up on devil 's rocks road ?
no . should t
i found lucy 's car , or what 's left of it .
this thing has insurance job written all over it .
so , how are we gonna do this ?
well , that 's the easy part .
you just put the money on the ground
hot a chance .
we do this face-to-face or not at all
i 'll keep the memory card
over my dead body .
isn 't that over your wife 's dead body ?
you go to hell !
you 've got a bad attitude .
you don 't really notice any of the scars .
of course , she 's fat@@ ter than my elephant
well , the years can be cruel , howard .
" life is nasty , bru@@ tish and short , " as the man said .
was it hob@@ bes ? :
i 'd have got on rather well with hob@@ bes .
shall we go for a drink ?
the cat@@ ledge family are wonderful people
they 're a wealthy pittsburgh family .
t@@ father made millions in coal before he died
now , the thing is , there 's a young woman staying with them ,
oh , lord , not another fake psych@@ ic .
what a pesti@@ l@@ ence they are .
they 're taken with her predictions of the future .
telling them what they want to hear . precisely .
hmm , and charging them for all the good news she brings .
exactly right . and , of course , she 's a pretty young thing
b@@ rice cat@@ ledge , caroline 's brother ,
b@@ rice cat@@ ledge 's sister caroline
oh , rubbish .
doesn 't he know that scientists are among the easiest to fool ?
well , this is the thing , i 'm embarrassed to say ,
i mean , i watched every move , and lord knows ,
i began to doubt my own clear thinking
oli@@ via and i were all set to take a holiday ,
but you hate holidays .
you 'll spend your whole time in your room practicing card tricks ,
and besides , you 've always loved the south of france ,
but if this woman knows she 's being watched by the great wei ling so@@ o ,
the usual headaches , resistance in the room .
she 'll never know you 're wei ling so@@ o .
don 't get angry with me , oli@@ via . it won 't be for long
you 've always had the measure of me , oli@@ via .
ever since our very first dinner ,
yes , you were very impressive .
oh , it was simply a matter of logic and common sense .
jit@@ tle howard
of all my nep@@ he@@ ws and ni@@ ec@@ es , you 're the only one , stanley ,
oh , i couldn 't agree more .
if only you had a slightly mil@@ der disposition ,
oh , i am his friend . notice i use the singular .
yes , he means he can tolerate me .
george , caroline , stanley . how do you do ?
oh , hello . stanley .
a great pleasure .
george . char@@ med .
of course , george and caroline are the reason i 'm here .
they 're a great deal less gul@@ li@@ ble
when she fool@@ ed howard bur@@ kan ,
i don 't know if howard told you , her name is sophie baker .
have you heard of her or ...
no , i have not , but these s@@ lea@@ zy fraud@@ sters change identity every month .
and i omitted to mention she 's here with her mother .
ah , now , that says a lot . yeah .
caroline , you were next to her .
she held my brother 's hand , and she actually made the table rise .
well , i looked for the usual devices , of course .
i thought maybe , wrist lifts , but they weren 't there .
she 's promised to try and make contact with my father ,
as i was saying , your mother and your brother
there is , of course , no spirit world , and even if there were ,
and , uh , how long will you be staying with us , mister .
oh , not very . i have business elsewhere .
ah , have you told him about sophie ?
ah , now , is this the girl that can read minds and such ?
well , she gets these sensory impressions . and , what are they ?
it 's hard to explain . she gets these mental vibr@@ ations .
her head vibr@@ ates ?
drink ? thank you .
have you got a whis@@ key , b@@ rice ? i absolutely do .
now , sophie looked into my eyes
about old girl@@ friends i 'd had ,
good heavens . you think she can do it with me ?
oh , of course . of course .
sophie sees all .
she can predict the future . in short , she 's a visionary .
and , i 'm told she 's very pleasant to look at .
she 's a visionary and a vision .
mother 's agreed to subsidize a foundation
oh , she 's nothing i haven 't seen before .
pretty young thing with a stage mother who handles the promotion ,
i want you to see her working
well , i mean , she 's not even a good actress .
" i ... i get the impression of the orient . china . "
well , i thought that was quite good ,
yes , it 's all very tant@@ alizing
and yet , she 's a fraud , howard .
because there is no sixth sense .
there are five senses , and no spirit world .
uh , yes , i had a bath . i had a little nap .
and now , you 're refres@@ hed .
well , no , not entirely . i had an unpleasant dream .
i 've had my share .
i dream@@ t i was being followed by a sinister chinese .
you have the far east on the brain .
what do you think it means ? i don 't know .
good evening .
what ? oh , i was just ..
i was receiving some mental impressions . excuse me .
come , stanley , let 's go to ... you look stun@@ ned .
i had an uncle who drowned many years ago .
and when i mentioned him ,
there 's absolutely no way she could know that unless
i once raised a real tiger , but we both have our tricks .
there was nothing supporting this candle , no threads , no wires ,
i ... i was just telling mr. pep@@ per@@ id@@ ge here
" apparent , " i think , is the key word .
is it " pep@@ per@@ id@@ ge , " or " tal@@ mud@@ ge , " or " ta@@ pl@@ inger ? "
i mean , i grabbed the candle and found absolutely nothing supporting it .
that 's because there 's nothing to find .
there is no metap@@ hysical world .
what you see out there is what you get .
i think mr. ni@@ etz@@ sche has disposed of the god matter rather convin@@ c@@ ingly .
good morning .
m@@ mm .
what are you doing today ?
i 'm going bir@@ d-@@ watching with b@@ rice .
do you want to join us ?
i can 't think of a more in@@ ane activity ,
why don 't you join me instead ?
where ?
she 's a remarkable woman .
we could have lunch . chat ?
actually , get to know one another better .
you think you 'll trick me into showing you how i deceive people .
come on .
i 'm sure b@@ rice cat@@ ledge can live
tell me , doesn 't it ever trouble your conscience
i could just as easily ask you ,
not if their hopes are false .
even if their hopes are false ,
then you admit you 're a fraud ?
i wonder if you get your cy@@ nic@@ ism from your grandfather ,
the missing toe .
why are you staring at me ?
where are you from ?
any other way , lies madness .
you 'd be happier if i was a fraud ,
no , it 's quite the opposite .
if you knew how much i don 't want you to be a fake .
oh , but think how embarrassing it would be for you .
is that why jenny dropped you ?
how could you know about jenny ?
i see long , blonde hair .
a wonderful laugh .
yes , she had a lovely laugh .
but who wants a pessimistic bore
ceo gets indicted for fraud@@ .@@ investors start losing money .
lots of money .
if i didn 't know bur@@ rows pulled that trigger ,
we 're talking half a billion dollars .
people have killed for a lot less .
not a good position you find yourself in , is it ?
whites don 't want you . blacks don 't want you .
you 're just caught in the middle , aren 't you ?
maybe you are in no position to be telling me my business . hm ?
that 's what i thought .
i 'm sure you can understand my reluctance to discuss past patients .
absolutely .
i 'm not accustomed to making enquiries like this , but i ..
i feel like i can get through to him .
i can help him .
i imagine he needs it in there .
what did you treat him for ?
michael suffered from a couple of things .
one was a condition called low latent inhibition .
sorry . i 'm not familiar with the term .
people who suffer from low latent inhibition see everyday things like you or i do
but where we just process the image of a lamp ,
the stem , the bulb , the bolts , even the wash@@ ers inside .
their brains are more open to incoming stimuli in the surrounding environment .
other people 's brains
we have to do it in order to keep our san@@ ity .
if someone with a low iq has low latent inhibition ,
do you think michael 's a genius ?
he came to me with absolutely no sense of self-@@ worth .
the loss of both parents very often does that to a child .
but with the low latent inhibition ,
he became very att@@ un@@ ed to all the suffering around him .
he couldn 't shut it out .
he became a rescu@@ er ,
i didn 't know all this about him .
i hope you don 't mind ,
if 's in my nature to want to help .
from what i understand it 's in your nature too .
you did a lot of good things before you were in here .
lot community work , lot charity work .
what happened ?
the man you 're talking about died the moment i stepped inside these walls .
all right .
ladies and gentlemen , united states secret service .
don 't you talk to your guy friends about sex ?
who ? a@@ very ? no .
well , you don 't talk about
maybe .
so you can do it with me .
okay , fine . your work 's suffering so bad ,
ah , and yet you find inspiration in tooth@@ paste .
maybe next time , you keep it to yourself .
that works for you ?
in a marriage ? yes . you keep your mouth shut .
although , uh , kin@@ da ... miranda 's been , uh ,
she has what , uh , if you squ@@ int real hard ,
bail@@ ey ?
yeah , she had that incident with the hole in the gloves .
i knew it fre@@ aked her out , but i was away .
i didn 't know how much it fre@@ aked her out .
just apologize , we feel terrible ,
she 'll be p@@ iss@@ y , but she 'll get over it .
well , i could have edwards tell her .
she 's on her service .
even better .
yeah .
i need to put a gastro@@ -@@ j on the schedule .
and if i tell grey she can 't get into the o.@@ r. until 7 : 00 ,
that means i have to work late .
you 'll be working late any@@ how
and to the people who count on you for support .
all right , all right , i will take it .
thank you .
and ke@@ p@@ ner invited me to her wedding .
did she ?
plus one .
and you 're gonna be invited ... plus one .
is she , like , expecting us to bring other people ?
no , bri@@ des are weird . go think about something else .
please ?
okay .
is he gonna make it ?
well , if yang can get her act together .
come with me .
please .
that 's nathan . he 's a real baby .
we 're not talking about me . we 're talking about him .
that 's ashley , his mom .
he has a very nice father .
this isn 't a study , me@@ red@@ ith .
this is a baby .
nathan is the first one in his family ,
i mean , he 's a baby .
have you lost your mind ?
do you think that because i have kids ,
no , i
now you want me to shut down my entire study ,
baby nathan and all of his college potential ,
i apologize . i 'll be over here .
you don 't have to actually date the woman she chooses .
i don 't wanna date any woman !
that 's why she 's doing this , stan .
i thought you were gonna talk her out of it .
you need to tell her yourself .
you 're both putting me in the middle .
because she list@@ ens to you .
she doesn 't listen to anyone !
besides , this is not such a terrible idea .
i 'm not a child she has to arrange day@@ care for !
a bunch of women she scared up on the internet ?
this is .. it 's awful .
it 's taking her mind off what 's actually happening .
that can 't be the worst thing in the world .
she thinks she can find someone to replace her ?
you can 't ... replace her .
nobody can possibly replace .. her .
why ?
why is this happening ?
if we 're gonna do this thing , we gotta do it now .
i can 't . i don 't have a conduit to put in him .
it won 't be done for another six hours .
i don 't know if he 's gonna last that long .
okay .
okay , let 's put him on an oscill@@ ator .
that 's not your lunch , shel@@ don ;
as they were incorrectly slic@@ ed ,
isn 't tomorrow your usual laundry night ?
the supermarket was out of my regular fabric sof@@ ten@@ er .
if this one under-@@ or over-@@ sof@@ tens ,
that 's thinking ahead .
the alternative would be to think backwards .
that 's just remembering .
so how 's amy ?
amy 's changed .
i might have to let her go .
oh , no . why ?
i thought she was a highly evolved creature
but recent events indicate that
we have to go outside .
no , it 's chil@@ ly outside . didn 't bring my jacket .
oh , for crying out loud .
what kind of super@@ hero needs a jacket ?
what kind of super@@ hero says , " di@@ bs on the red ti@@ ghts !
di@@ bs on the red ti@@ ghts ! "
wait . are we starting now ? or is that what you 're going to say
i 'm hanging up .
you got a number for a cab ?
anything i can do ?
bet i got you beat .
for worst day ever .
there 's no way you could beat this one .
what , did your dog die or something ?
happy birthday !
yeah , 23 's kind of a big one .
yeah , after the flood washed it away .
you know , food for the worms ?
you 've never heard of the black@@ water flood ?
20-@@ something years ago ?
it was the end , all right .
there is no river 's ed
same as your house .
unless you like old wives ' tales .
well , yeah , i might like them .
don 't sho@@ vel that shit to these kids , lucky .
there 's one story that says that house is still standing
if you believe stories for idi@@ ots and mor@@ ons .
you got some kind of deed ?
what do you mean ?
it 's a long shot , but we mapped something a few days
this is the old highway where the flood took it out .
see this path through the forest ?
something big definitely came through here .
like it 's holding on , just for me .
stop right there .
now turn around and walk away .
look , don 't get the wrong idea .
we 're , uh , public land and survey .
who used to live here ?
what the hell is that ?
what 's that in the chimney ?
the deed you have to this house is
look , i just want to know if people from my
chairs , tables , chan@@ deli@@ ers .
they shouldn 't be here , nick .
i thought you said that was you .
you said you 'd been sw@@ inging a hammer in here for years .
i have .
i 've been trying to tear it down .
nick , let 's go !
you tell you friend to run as fast and as
nick@@ y ?
and you run with him , and never come back .
there 's some guys out here !
you come back here , it 'll be the ast thing you 'll ever
they 're trying to cut us off !
what the hell are these guys ?
go , go , go .
ryan ?
yeah , i think .
what the fuck happened ?
what ?
what did he say to you ?
he didn 't say anything !
what did you say to him ?
get the fuck off of him .
look , i do not know what 's going on , ok ?
did he say something to you or not ?
they don 't even fucking walk upright .
yeah , well , they know how to throw a fucking axe .
he 's running something illegal out of that house .
or he 's just some hill@@ billy lun@@ atic who thinks the state 's
oh my god !
oh , shit !
stop !
no one lives here , evi@@ e , ok ?
trust me , no one .

i 've got an idea while we were sitting here .
m@@ mm , like at a wedding ?
or a cruise ship .
it 's really easy . anyone can con@@ ga .
i 'll set my head on fire before i con@@ ga .
men are afraid to dance . the male ego is too fragile .
in her eyes , you 're a ridiculous peasant .
oh , oh , yeah . guess what .
i 'm not a peasant , mr. whis@@ kers . him@@ m ?

i think that 's a fantastic idea
she drinks tea in carriages and fuc@@ ks men

what happened ?
what do you think ? david lost it .
i tried to f@@ end him off , and he ..
i don 't believe you .
10@@ ol@@ x at me
i told him you were leaving ..
you told him ? why would you tell him that ?
because you wouldn 't have .
don 't want to talk about it .
what , she didn 't come to pick you up ?
just let it go , okay ?
hey , i 'm here as a friend . nothing else .
now , come on .
move over .
david , come on , you had to see this coming
but funny ,
how ? he told me what happened with your mom .
why would you keep that a secret ?
i wouldn 't have cared if you had ust told me .
i was ashamed , okay ?
was ashamed
and i hated what i did .
if you thought i was such an angel
so that 's it ? you 're just gonna walk away ?
i know i 'm not good enough for you .
but i 'm not gonna spend my entire life proving that i am .
you 're a co@@ ward , you know that ?
you don 't fight for love .
you 're terrified of it !
i 'm sorry . do you want me to leave you alone ?
no . i 'm just missing home .
time helps .
it 's slow and it 's painful , but it works .
talking hel ps .
going out with other people , seeing friends .
i can 't , david . i 'm so sorry .
anne , please .
david didn 't get into u@@ ga
uh , no , i didn 't .
although i 'm not surprised
it 's why i called helen and she said she never got my letter .
you told me it went out with the mail
how could you have fallen this far ?
just hear me out , okay ?
two tickets .
we can leave tonight . we could go anywhere .
this isn 't over , t@@ ade
haven 't moved on .
and i don 't think you have either .
do you love this other guy ?
do you love him like you love me ?
do you ?
were you driving the mg ?
no , it must have been keith .
this is the one .
when the cd player blew , we had to bring all the records downstairs .
it 's awesome .
what are you doing in here ?
we were just listening
oh , look at this . you scrat@@ ched it .
you 're supposed to put them back in the slee@@ ves immediately .
dad , they 're just records .
these are just things . he 'd want us to play them .
he 's not here to ask , is he ?
no , i guess he 's not .
it was going pretty well till we ran into you .
tried to warn you .
i 'm just giving you a hard time , that 's all .
i know it 's not your fault .
fate consp@@ ired .
isn 't that always the way ?
you know , believe it or not , before i ended up here ,
in a gospel band .
yeah .
me and my gib@@ son and jesus were gonna rock the world .
but , you know , got married and had a kid , and ...
those were the days , though .
you guys are the best .
what 's with the clothes ?
well , with all the new stuff i bought for work ,
i meant why are they folded ?
but whatever .
o@@ oh , what 's this ?
that , believe it or not , is my prom dress .
my date would 've had to clean that up .
o@@ oh , i have an idea .
maybe we can have , like , a prom do-@@ over .
oh , that would be so much fun .
we could decorate the roof and make the guys wear tu@@ x@@ e@@ dos .
o@@ oh , and get our hair done , and slow-@@ dance .
okay , guys , trust me ,
you went to seven pro@@ ms ?
yeah , let 's see .
uh , four " under the seas , " two " enchan@@ ted evenings , "
hey , where 's bern@@ ade@@ tte ?
she and amy are out dress shopping for their prom thing .
oh , yeah , i got that ev@@ ite .
ever since i saw pretty in pink ,
but then i saw carrie ,
but then i saw never been kissed ,
this prom thing 's been a real roller co@@ aster .
ber@@ nie 's really excited .
i-i could tell because her voice got so high ,
i 'm not the best at reading facial cu@@ es ,
you know , if you 're not gonna learn how to do this ,
bruce wayne doesn 't wear a cli@@ p-@@ on .
bruce wayne doesn 't make his roommate tie it for him .
his name is alfred , and , yes , he does .
there , perfect .
what , are you sure ?
it 's my first prom , i want to do it correctly .
i thought you were gonna pretend to be an alien .
i was , but penny didn 't want to .
you didn 't want to .
bern@@ ade@@ tte , amy ,
and even i knew it was weird to hire somebody .
was that a fl@@ ask ?
yes .
i 've decided to embrace all of the traditions
you 're gonna put alcohol in the punch ?
oh , no , this is pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate juice .
if you had ripped ie@@ ans and a leather jacket ,
so , anything else planned for tonight ?
oh , everything .
getting our picture taken , slow-@@ dancing ,
pointing out that kings aren 't elected .
it 's gonna be off the hook .
and while you 're at it ,
why would you say that ?
you know , because ..
because a lot of people lose their virg@@ inity on prom night .
penny implied the same thing .
is this true ?
just relax , it 's a joke .
you don 't have hormones .
wow , you look amazing .
oh , it 's a scal@@ y genital organ
try not to touch it when you 're dancing .
excuse me .
where are you going ?
and for your information , leonard ,
but to be fair , the twins were a real handful that day .
you 're making me worry .
what 's going on ?
what 's going on is we 're about to go to a prom .
and there 's a great deal of pressure
what pressure ?
all i said was you look handsome .
can you please open the door ?
it 's not just that .
leonard and penny also made comments about it .
and i 'm not blind .
even i looked twice when i saw my posterior
so , i met je@@ an@@ ie at your aunt glad@@ ys ' .
she passed me the man@@ is@@ che@@ witz ,
is this what i sound like when i talk about india ?
so , my mother 's okay with this ?
why would your mother have a problem with me and stuart ?
because they have a weird , inappropriate relationship .
you worry about getting your ass back in that seat in time .
if you pull this off , you can come up to my room later ..
and the word " no " won 't be in my vocabulary .
just make sure we get paid .
in and out .
you know i can 't get into that .
now , we 've been negotiating this for months .
i 've jumped through all your ho@@ ops .
i 've agreed to meet you here .
do you want to sell the card to me or not ?
be right back .
that 's a lot of secrets on a little piece of plastic .
let me give you a little bit of advice .
and this is on the house .
watch your step with that thing .
the company will do anything to get it back .
don 't i know it .
the allies spent two and a half years ...
planning the invasion of nor@@ mandy .
but on d-@@ day it came down to a handful of men ..
on a strip of beach ..
to decide the fate of the world .
what i 'm getting at , g@@ ret@@ chen ..
is even the best plan is only as good ..
as the moving parts on the ground executing it .
ms : i have info on sara .
michael
it 's good to see you .
so where 's your new best friend ?
i don 't know about that .
but whist@@ ler 's not who you think he is .
we 're working together against the company .
you kept your word to me .
you 're the first that 's ever done that . gr@@ aci@@ as .
why must you go after this man ?
you could choose not to .
where i come from , there 's something called a blood fe@@ ud .
yes .
michael sco@@ field left me for dead ...
one too many times , as it turns out .
what is spanish for " little angel " ?
angel@@ ita .
he was an independent contractor .
who worked for the company for about ten years .
he was assigned to retrieve sc@@ yl@@ la once it went missing .
do you know what sc@@ yl@@ la is ?
it 's the company 's little black book .
so he was going to make a copy of it and give it to me .
what do you want from me ?
you 're looking at major time .
you know that , right ?
so how would you like to walk away from it al ..
not do a day ?
all right . sara tan@@ cred@@ i , last seen in panama .
if you help me find her ..
maybe we 've got a deal .
i 'm sorry , she 's not my department , sc@@ yl@@ la is .
then go find it yourself .
it seems to me ..
the u.s. government should have a little more reach ..
get me back to the land ' o cotton .
of course .
ready .
only a few people in government will know of the operation .
it has to stay that way ...
or people 's lives will be in danger , mine included .
taking down the company sounds a little bit more than a two-@@ man job , no ?
i 'm going to get you help .
i thought you said , you couldn 't trust anybody .
yeah , but maybe you can .
all right , two of your co@@ hor@@ ts ..
fernando su@@ cre , and brad bel@@ lick were arrested .
they 're both facing time .
and alexander mah@@ one is in a colorado jail cell .
good , let him sit there .
he was working with whist@@ ler .
and you 'll have me .
okay ? whatever you need , i 'll provide .
whist@@ ler also said something about a second step ,
yeah , the card has all the data on it .
but it 's encrypted .
i don 't know .
so , we 've got a data card , which could be anywhere .
and we 've got to break into a building ...
the location of which has yet to be determined .
simple enough .
how do you know our dad ?
he heard from contacts that i could be trusted .
your father was a good man .
why now ?
look , i 've been going after the company for five years .
okay ? when whist@@ ler was killed yesterday ...
the plug was going to be pulled on the entire operation .
but , uh ..
i convinced my superiors to give it one more chance .
so this is like job security for you ?
well , when we go out there and risk our nec@@ ks ..
you can collect your pension .
no , no , no , lincoln .
okay , some people still care about their job .
some people still fight for this country .
maybe you 've been a little too distracted ..
you can look for sara , if she 's alive .
if we take this deal , we 'll both be dead ...
long before i get the chance . lin@@ c .
you guys must have some big@@ -time friends .
what are you talking about ?
somebody just posted ...
and there are some things ...
you can 't hide .
know what i mean ?
how high is your threshold for pain ?
you sure you don 't want a sed@@ ative ?
we 're gonna go into the night .
how do you feel ?
lighter somehow .
look , i don 't know how we 're gonna take them down .
i don 't even know who they are .
but i do know one thing ...
but you can guarantee it 'll be the federal , supre@@ max .
no more updates .
call me when they are dead .
welcome to los angles .
as it turns out , men who have escaped not one ..
and stay off the company 's radar .
you need to keep your heads down and your ears open .
we 've provided cell phones , clothing , and toil@@ e@@ tries .
all the basic necessities to get you up and running .
you pat@@ ted these guys down before you let them in , right ?
his suit , you don 't buy a suit like that ..
on a cop 's salary or pulling weekend gi@@ gs as a driver .
that means he 's full-time .
he 's highly paid .
you ask our friend mr. self to run tax records .
in los angeles drawing a military pension ..
and taking six figures from a private security company ..
and you narrow your field from 10 million till about 50 .
and then i can pick the guy out from there .
find the driver , you find the card@@ holder .
mexican desert , 60 miles south of us border .
we haven 't ate or drank anything for days .
oh , i don 't want to die out here .
we ain 't gonna die , san@@ cho .
tell you what .
why don 't we rest here for a while , huh ?
travel at night when it 's cooler .
si , that sounds good .
what are we gonna do when we get there ?
to san diego .
you mean after michael pays ..
will only last so long .
what does that mean ?
i mean , then what if somebody finds out we 're not .
what if we don 't have to be in the house ?
if the card , this sc@@ yl@@ la is so important .
maybe the guy is carrying it on him .
well , according to public records .
and he 's a ceo of a company called spectro@@ le@@ um .
heavy hit@@ ter like that 's gonna have security 24-@@ 7 .
and we gotta get this thing ..
without anyone knowing it 's gone , right ?
so even if he 's got it on him , how do we get it off him ?
you don 't steal the card .
you copy it .
oh , now you 're interested in what i gotta say , right ?
copying it will make it harder .
not only do you have to steal it .
you have to return it , genius .
only if you don 't got me , hom@@ bre .
what 's that ?
this is the reason i got bu@@ sted .
oh , yeah , yeah , no .
i 'm looking at federal time cause i stole a cell phone , seriously ?
i invented this
it looks like a cell phone but it 's really like ...
a digital black hole .
wireless hard drive that sw@@ allows up any electronic data ...
within ten feet of it .
like what ?
like the account info ..
of anyone at star@@ bucks with a lat@@ te and a laptop .
like the pin number of any credit card used at a gas pump .
i can walk out of here and get the identities .
and financial statements of ten people in ten minutes ...
on a slow day , with one hand on my junk .
and the information embedded in sc@@ yl@@ la ?
if we can get close enough ...
it 's ours .
just a matter of whether you do it before or after ..
i shame you in front of your co@@ workers here .
tell me where the company keeps the box , jas@@ per .
could be anywhere , i don 't know .
somebody does .
right ?
somebody that you might have access to .
you know , if you go down this road .
your government job won 't protect you .
then i better not get caught , right ?
if i don 't find something to eat soon .
i don 't know what i 'm gonna do .
we 're not gonna make it .
we just got to keep talking . san@@ cho .
keep our brains focused on something other than ..
our empty bel@@ lies and our dry mouths , okay ?
come on .
let 's start with , uh , your@@ -@@ your favorite color .
i 'm hungry , te@@ ddy .
why should the both of us die out here .
when one of us could help the other one survive ?
you don 't want to do this . please .
i 'll make it quick . i promise !
san@@ cho .
why 'd you have to go and do something sos
it must be in there , right ?
look , there 's no way we 're getting ...
in that house without being seen .
i know .
well , if the card 's in there , how we gonna copy it ?
we 're not .
she 's gonna do it for us .
what 're you reading ?
" there is no fighting her . "
i can never find a good bag .
i 'm a teacher , and i have books and grading materials and ...
i should probably go ahead and just invest ..
in a wagon one of these days .
yeah , that 's why i love this bag .
it has so many pockets .
do you mind if i take a look ?
oh , no .
thanks .
ah , thank god , thank god .
you all right , mister ?
yeah , my damn truck blew a gas@@ ket a few miles back .
hello , i 'm from the alarm company .
we 've been receiving some , uh ..
strange signals from your property .
we 'd like you to check the windows , please .
make sure all the contacts are still active .
all the windows ?
yes , ma 'am .
every room in the house .
okay , hold on .
does she still have the bag ?
yeah .
she 's got it .
someone posted their bail .
i need to know who .
i 'm showing a bruce ben@@ nett .
former aid to governor frank tan@@ cred@@ i .
you think it fell out ?
we looked everywhere .
you think we got the thing copied ?
like i said , i can 't read the content ..
without downloading the device , but ..
then , yeah , i think we got it .
doesn 't matter if we got it if we can 't find it .
where the hell is it ?
it 's still inside the house .
that 's why the maid went back inside .
she must have found it .
assumed it belonged to her boss .
and then she left it behind .
well , then guess what , fel@@ las , it 's game over .
you know how many months ...
it took me to make that thing , michael ?
what , you just think i can whip up another one in a couple seconds ?
losing it is not the problem .
if they find it , that 's the problem .
if they find out someone was after that card , we 're done .
what do you mean , done ? what does that mean ?
does that mean we 're gonna go back to prison ?
are they gonna kill us ?
means we go in and get it .
if we had a few days , we 'll figure out a way to pull this off .
but i gather we don 't have that kind of time .
yeah , you gather right .
look , if you want us to get that device out of there .
you gotta throw us a bone .
give us some extra help .
what you 're asking for requires involving additional people .
which given the covert nature of this operation .
i cannot do .
then you 're asking for the impossible .
no , what i 'm asking for is competence , okay ?
i 'm not the one who put the entire mission ...
in the hands of a damn maid .
look , if the company finds that copy of sc@@ yl@@ la before we do .
that 's it , michael , that 's ball game .
they 're gonna find out who was behind it .
what if our father after everything he discovered ..
about the company , what ..
what if that 's what he finally realized ?
you know , uh , the one thing i remember most ..
about dad was the back of his head .
always walking out the front door .
always running from something .
mom , us , himself .
but the one thing he never ran away from ..
was his belief that the company needed to be taken down .
and we got an opportunity to do that .
then this is our fight , not theirs .
man , this ain 't fox river .
these guys chose to be here .
remember that .
they got a choice .
of the u.s. penitentiary in liv@@ ing@@ ston , texas .
where the brothers were allegedly sent .
there are still 105 inmates there .
and no one has been released during that time .
someone is playing a shell game , bruce .
i 'm just trying to find out who .
i have no criminal jurisdiction over .
i know you b@@ ailed them out .
i know you 've been in contact with sara tan@@ cred@@ i .
wanted to talk some more about what happened in panama
how 's that ?
because you 're a little like me .
because you 're gonna say you 're fine , that you can handle it .
so , um !
i 'll just leave it at this .
i 'm here .
whenever you want to talk , i 'm here .
but i also knew that if anything happened to me .
you were gonna blame yourself .
you would spend the rest of your life punishing yourself for it .
and , i can 't bear the thought of that .
so can we make a deal right now that we 're even .
and just wipe the slate clean and no guilt and no responsibility ?
if we 're gonna be together .
i don 't want it to be out of a sense of obligation .
or-@@ or even that we should be .
because of what we 've been through .
i just want to start over .
start over .
okay .
also , all electronic devices must be turned off at this time .
our flight time to atlanta is approximately 52 minutes .
flight attendants , take your seats .
so what did you do last night ?
i crashed , went straight to bed .
all right , here we go .
engine instruments are in the green .
they 're just cousins .
we need to get a move on .
the client 's gonna come over to the apartment at 4 : 00 .
i am sw@@ amped . i can 't just leave .
gl@@ oria , we 're here to sell your apartment .
we don 't work at the salon .
well , i-i tried to talk about it this morning ,
u@@ h-@@ huh . i 'm sorry .
u@@ h-@@ huh , jim sorry .
did you say i act like my job is life and death ?
well , excuse me , my , my job is just death .
yeah , that 's right .
60 hours a week ,
which reminds me , i have a customer waiting .
i gotta get back to work .
no , i 'll call you later .
david ? david ?
david , you 're zoning out again .
i 'm back , doc .
so let me get this straight .
you found a john doe in his 20s on the pavement near the strip ,
sweat on the body bag
dead men don 't sweat , do they , doctor ?
about as often as they get up and walk away .
have a trace of blood , as well .
that 's from the liver stick punc@@ ture .
what 'd you find in his pockets ?
city bus pass . no particular route .
this old notebook ,
" st@@ one@@ wall 1 / 14 , day seven .
turn around and tell these guys
see how far you get .
come on .
maybe you ought to keep that to yourself .
d@@ mv facial recognition ?
yeah . yeah , it 's worth a shot .
you know , i considered calling the d@@ mv .
half the people that work up there are the walking dead anyway .
maybe they recognize this guy .
uh , i got the dna results .
neither john doe was in co@@ dis .
ho@@ dges has a proposal :
yeah , " zom@@ bie dna index system . "
he also wants you to know
the potassium and glucose levels are consistent with the living .
that 's all you have for us ?
was dismissed by the scientific community .
but not without one big , fat scandal .
rumor has it that dr. aden ,
at least until one of his students
he was ban@@ ished by the university ,
so the government didn 't want to step on the toes
all right , so our mor@@ gue zom@@ bie
there 's got to be a connection .
is aden still around ?
he still receives a government pension check .
and i was able to track down the address .
hello , doctor .
casino 's three miles further .
dr. aden ?
dr. aden .. uh ... we 'd like to speak with you .
you got the wrong guy .
we 're from the crime lab .
we found something of yours .
lying government bast@@ ards !
they claimed that all of my papers had been destroyed .
ban@@ ished me from university property .
it was a good way to cut me out of the green and the glory .
it 's phil@@ o far@@ ns@@ worth all over again !
i 'm sorry . where did you find this ?
in the pocket of , uh , this young man .
do you recognize him ?
u@@ h-@@ uh .. he 's dead ?
he 's obviously on an autopsy table .
actually , the young man in question ...
.... arose .
the la@@ zar@@ us myth made real ?
re-@@ animation ? this is getting more interesting .
it 's , uh ...
not as easy as you might think , bringing back the dead .
treating the work as their own .
in your , um , re-@@ animation experiments , doctor ,
i had the ith@@ aca of that most profound mystery within my sights .
could almost reach out and touch it .
but i saw the storm clouds gathering .
the ma@@ el@@ stro@@ m .
for those not wise enough to pull their sails in ,
it 's a dead man 's party .
except the third person looks like a woman .
how could they do this ?
what have they done ?
if they 've given it to some health club ...
dr. aden , slow down .
dude . you going to tell us what we 're taking ?
no need to add baggage to your trip .
trust me , kur@@ t .
it 's going to be an adventure .
it 's time to put your cameras on .
see you on re-entry .
god@@ speed , alice .
max 's friends kur@@ t and alice .
maybe we can get access to max 's university email account ;
see who his co-@@ pilots were .
yeah .
blocking out all earthly stimuli .
you know , in the movie altered states ,
to strip the self down
you wouldn 't want to go ven@@ turing ，
maybe the tank wasn 't his idea .
i noticed some faint bru@@ ising that started to develop
so , i snapped some infrared photos .
hand marks . he was held down .
that 's one way to dro@@ wn in just ten inches of water .
so drowning is cod ?
congratulations . you 're bat@@ ting . 500 .
yeah , great for a hit@@ ter , bad for pronoun@@ cing death .
let me see your e@@ kg .
what are you looking for , doc ?
your zom@@ bie from the strip was under the influence of a paraly@@ tic ,
the way you 've got it set , it wouldn 't pick up my heart@@ beat .
i 'd be a fl@@ at-@@ liner .
you 're lucky you 're not ben@@ ched .
could this cocktail produce , in certain individuals ,
why do you ask ?
well , one of our young explo@@ rers killed the other .
well , i would have to know more about
there 's no fighting in the war room , dr. str@@ angel@@ o@@ ve .
i want you to look at something .
.... beyond our past journeys of the mind .
tonight , we free ourselves from the physical plane .
alice even pl@@ uc@@ ked out the black ones .
she 's got some academic honors awards ,
a card from her mom 's funeral five months ago .
doesn 't take a detective .
mom 's death took a toll .
o@@ oh , another one of dr. aden 's note@@ books .
stand back , sir .
dr. aden said this was going to end badly .
we have two dead .
le@@ t-@@ s hope there 's still time for alice .
the notebook i found in alice kat@@ su 's room
it is a dat@@ e-@@ tag match to a formula
which means dr. aden wrote those notes recently .
right .
the notebook was not among his archived papers .
so how did alice get it ?
from the doctor himself .
he and alice were e-mail bud@@ dies .
she initiated contact five months ago .
when her mother died .
but aden is not exactly advertising on bus ben@@ ches .
alice saw an anonymous commen@@ ter
she kind of felt like mr . anonymous knew a little bit too much .
so she e-mails ,
i was scanning through kur@@ t daw@@ son 's video
so , here . kur@@ t 's just wandering campus .
then this happens .
some kind of interference .
yeah , kur@@ t 's receiver picked up a signal from another camera .
i 'm working on isol@@ ating the competing image ,
well , those are women 's shoes .
are we looking through alice 's camera ?
she must have been in close proximity to kur@@ t ,
where is she , and what 's she doing ?
it 's hard to say . but check this out .
what , a car stopped for her ?
weather radar , off . landing gear , down .
wi@@ pers , off .
battery power , auto . external power source connected .
ap@@ u fire protection test button , check .
flash@@ light , check . escape rope , check .
sichuan 86@@ 33 , you are identified .
climb to 3,900 meters , sichuan 86@@ 33
when we get home , you 'd better catch up on your homework .
this toy is for you .
thank you !
please sit tight and fasten your seat belt .
sichuan 86@@ 33 , contact chengdu on 12@@ 3.7 . goodbye .
it 's 12@@ 3.7 . goodbye , sichuan 86@@ 33 .
setting 12@@ 3.7 .
check .
sichuan 86@@ 33 , you are identified .
continue to climb to 9,200 meters .
pay attention to abnormal weather patterns in the southeast region .
sichuan 86@@ 33 , do you confirm return to chongqing ?
returning to chengdu .
affirmative .
be careful of the turbulence .
please return to your seat .
please fasten your seat belts .
sir , please be careful .
come on . this way . hurry up .
we will make an announcement when there is more information .
one moment , please .
we still need confirmation on this .
7@@ w a@@ 81 .
and that 's when the dream that was paul young 's life
years later ,
this woman had no identification ,
and that is how people learned that fel@@ icia till@@ man ,
i see you got the suit i sent over . you like it ?
i like anything that 's not orange .
well , get ready to do all sorts of shopping .
your settlement check came in .
so where you going first ?
after all these years in prison ,
all i want is to go home .
what ? to your old neighborhood ?
you sound surprised .
none of your neighbors supported you during the trial .
no one would blame you if you hated them a little .
oh , i don 't hate them ...
a little .
and so my husband returned to wi@@ ster@@ ia lane .
the neighbors were surprised to see him .
they hadn 't thought about paul young in years .
but he had thought about them .
and he was going to make sure
the phone call that comes in the middle of the night ..
the letter that arrives by special courier ..
the e-mail marked " urgent ! .. "
yes , there are all sorts of ways
it must be delivered in person .
why do i have to tell them ?
you said this couple lives in your neighborhood .
trustees of the hospital feel
and just what am i supposed to say ?
" great block party .
" by the way@@ . one of our nurses
normally , i 'd give you a hug ,
again , very sorry .
god ! how am i gonna tell carlos ?
he is gonna be so angry !
and he 'll probably find a way to blame me !
you 'll never guess who 's back !
mom , we don 't have any clean plates .
he paid in advance , and he didn 't have pets . i didn 't care .
how is paul even out of jail ?
that man@@ iac was serving a life sentence .
hello , ladies .
if you 'd like to come in for a while ,
i 'll tell you the story .
come on now .
it 's a good one .
fel@@ icia till@@ man 's alive ?
why are you so surprised ?
i said that over and over again in my trial .
oh , wait . that 's right .
none of you could make it to the cour@@ thou@@ ses .
i told myself i 'd explain how i was framed
in our defense , we thought you were a cold-@@ blo@@ o@@ ded killer .
i missed my friends .
innocent or not , that guy still gives me the cre@@ eps .
i can 't believe paul young is back on wi@@ ster@@ ia lane .
and he 's using my shower .
jack !
you here for your 9 iron ? damn , i thought if i sha@@ ved ,
actually , i need to talk to you and your wife .
you look a little pa , buddy . something wrong ?
i think we should wait for ga@@ by .
jack , what 's going on here , man ?
you 're making me nervous .
let 's just go inside , hmm ?
no ! this is impossible .
we haven 't been able to track the family down yet .
then we 're not telling ga@@ by ,
carlos , i have a legal responsibility here .
she has to be told .
fine ! i 'll do it .
but i don 't know how .
this is going to destroy her .
n@@ ope . i was wrong . pre@@ ston ,
why are we doing this ?
when rene@@ e pulls up to this house ,
it 's so ... co@@ zy and intimate and ...
it 's so ... co@@ zy and intimate and ...
pay attention , kids .
you 're learning a lot of new words for " small . "
i hate ban@@ ging around my lonely old barn of a house .
sometimes weeks go by without me
i 'm sure you see them on wh@@ ipping day .
ly@@ net@@ te , why so mean ?
i worked on these compliments all the way from the airport .
drive slower next time .
mom .
it 's all right . we 're just old friends re@@ connecting .
you know , they set their own hours .
they work from their own homes .
and oh , yo@@ y , yo@@ y , the money .
that sounds like a dream job .
i 'll bet you 'd be real good at it .
come on .
you said you had money problems .
here 's what martha makes in a week .
unto martha for selling her dignity
i promise , you won 't do anything
look for yourself ! she 's on camera three !
what are you looking at ?
just some family photos .
nice of your physical therapist to help with the move .
so are you gonna be okay ?
let 's see . uh , i 'm getting a divorce .
i lost my business , and i 'm sitting here
i 've had better mon@@ days .
i 'm sorry .
don 't be .
it 's for the best .
we haven 't been happy for a long time .
i think i need to sit quietly
well , whatever you do ..
i know it 'll be spectacular .
good-@@ bye , b@@ ree .
hi , b@@ ree .
i 've been thinking about our conversation last night .
i just wanted to see how you were doing .
i 'm fine .
in fact , i took your advice .
i found myself a project .
i 'm surprised you agreed to see me .
i wanted to spit in your face .
i didn 't realize there 'd be glass .
that 's right . you 're not used to prison .
give yourself time .
18 months with good behavior .
you 're giving me a lot of reasons
maybe i can give you a few po@@ inters on prison life .
i 've become a bit of an expert thanks to you .
hey , here 's one .
it never hurts to tip the guard does your cavity search .
i will see you behind bars again , or dead ...
whichever is easier .
here 's another pointer .
they always record the conversations ,
you murdered my sister .
that 's a crazy , groundless accusation .
i have to go now .
i have things to do like shopping
what was ly@@ net@@ te like in college ?
uh , absolutely fear@@ less .
she just kept wearing those parachute pants ,
yes , rene@@ e was always the one with the fashion sense .
before i met her ,
i 'd never even heard of gu@@ cci or pra@@ da .... .
i 'd never even heard of gu@@ cci or pra@@ da ...
or ch@@ lam@@ y@@ dia .
wow , you guys play rough .
a bl@@ ouse from the " i 've stopped trying " collection
and .. somebody got hunt .
that 's great@@ . easy shots . you got more money than me .
oh , it 's not about the money .
the ly@@ net@@ te i knew never would have settled for this .
you were adventu@@ rous .
you jumped on@@ stage at a spring@@ ste@@ en concert .
it 's just hard for me to reconcile
who had a thre@@ esome with two of the guys
why would she do this ?
why would she jump in a private jet
two guys , huh ?
we 're not talking about that anymore .
i mean , isn 't her life perfect enough ?
does she really need to score bonus points
so was it one rugby guy and then the other ,
oh , drop it , tom .
you know , i have shiel@@ ded you
when she made that ... " aw , "
she doesn 't get to be disappointed in my life .
well , maybe you should tell her how you feel .
yeah . you 're right . you 're right .
in fact , i am going to tell her a lot more than that .
and i won 't let anything change that .
pork ch@@ ops for dinner .
i know it was a bit of a spl@@ urge ,
something wrong ?
the bank turned down my loan application .
without that money , i can 't hire any help .
and without help ,
we 'll never get out@@ ta here like that .
or@@ son , don 't we have plans ?
the wine tasting ?
why don 't you wait for me in the van ?
as you may have gle@@ aned ,
was it evolving while you and i were still together ?
no , no , of course not .
that would be a hard no .
hold , please .
two mothers . only one gets the kid .
we knew they 'd shoot that down .
they are shooting everything down
they have the luxury of being unreasonable right now .
we have less than 12 hours to try to settle .
their witness line@@ up is better , and they know it .
we have richard web@@ ber .
gamble .
we 're here .
or else they both stand their ground .
we 'll see you in court .
and the kid gets torn apart .
hi , sofia !
mer will be down in a second .
i 'm so sorry about this .
please . it 's the best way to spend a day off .
i 'm thinking pan@@ cakes for breakfast .
with chocolate chips ?
damn it . uter@@ us is perfor@@ ated .
let me have a look there .
thank you .
getting fluid in her abdomen .
this pregnancy has just become non-@@ viable .
this baby 's barely viable outside that womb .
it 's only 24 weeks .
you can repair it , can 't you ?
i can try .
throw in a plasma patch , hope for the best .
" hope for the best ? "
then a patch is the way to go .
five seconds ago , you wanted to deliver .
now you 're confident in a plasma patch ?
dr. kare@@ v , i am the ob on call here .
if i say that a patch is best , a patch is best .
ke@@ p@@ ner ?
if it keeps the baby in ,
stay in your lane , dr. kare@@ v .
pre@@ p albu@@ min polymers , please .
i 'll update the mom .
how 'd it go ? how 's jenny ?
well , she 's still in surgery but doing great .
we located the source of the leak ,
and the baby ?
the baby is healthy and still in uter@@ o ,
it 's too little to be born , right ?
it wouldn 't be ideal .
i-i need you to sign one more form
it seems like i was just here
you built for@@ ts and it was really fun .
morning ! come on in !
i don 't want to .
i 'm sorry . it 's been a really rough morning .
she woke up really early
it is a transcript of text messages
cal@@ lie and i swap all the time .
we have very flexible schedules .
could you please tell the court the tally at the bottom ?
dr. web@@ ber ?
she asked dr. torres to switch with her 34 times .
we know she was out with you at least 25 times .
and that 's in addition to the previously mentioned
now , let 's just pause and think about this for a minute .
there are only 180 days in six months ' time ,
150 out of 180 .
calls for speculation .
sustained .
your honor , we 'd like to request a short recess .
so , cal@@ lie 's okay slu@@ t-@@ sha@@ ming me now ?
don 't let them r@@ attle you .
they 're making it sound like a working mom is a bad mom .
i mean , we just lost in there , right ?
hey !
all you gotta do is come and get it .
it 's mine and i want it .
god damn it , be careful with that !
come on , let 's go . take me out of here .
that cost a lot of money ,
os@@ good ?
no one 's got a fuc@@ kin ' name like os@@ good .
god damn it !
i try to behave like a gentleman , dor@@ is .
i really do , you know , but there 's an animal side to everybody .
you think less of me , don 't you ? for walking out
i was the one who dragged you out of there .
i say that ' cause i think it 's the truth .
i 'm a licensed pilot , took kar@@ ate in tokyo .
i lec@@ tured on economics at yale .
i can memor@@ ize the front pages
i was the national golden gloves champion three years in a row .
i 'm fluent in four languages
jesus !
don 't interrupt me . there 's more .
yeah .
i lie alo@@ t .
i 'm staying at caes@@ ars , mr. wild .
shall we say 7 : 00 ?
7 : 00 , mr. kin@@ nick
it fuc@@ kin ' worked ! it really worked .
how could you be such a bast@@ ard os , huh ?
you said i was a co@@ ward and my breath was bad .
that 's not an insult , that 's a fuc@@ kin ' insult
and you didn 't tell me you were gonna take my fuc@@ kin ' hair .
what was that , man ?
she likes you better without it .
he@@ h , women , they like honesty .
who knew ? word to the wise .
all right , fresh from the bank ..
i stay with her on account of our four kids and i can survive ,
what 'd i miss ? the special specimen .
fuck ! sh@@ h , he 's about to ask for a memory .
okay , she 's dead , but she won 't lie down .
oh , she 'll lie down . she just doesn 't realize
i could get a key to a $ 1,000 suite .
so please , marie , leave me with the memory .
give me something i can cherish to remember .
okay .
okay . thank you . come on .
son of a bitch ! how does he get fuc@@ ked every time ?
i use discs , actually .
discs , tapes .
you 've got to confront him with this . record his reaction .
even if he denies it , it 's something .
i 'm in a tricky position here . i signed a confidentiality agreement .
it 's a bit late for that .
and what if i don 't record any discs ?
then you 'll be sub@@ po@@ en@@ a@@ ed and forced to repeat this whole story .
then i 'll deny it .
then i 'll give them this .
frank is recording every word .
aren 't you , frank ?
oh ! come on !
don 't look so shocked . what did you expect ?
that i 'd come into a meeting with a man working for lang
except you 're not working for lang anymore .
you 're working for the good guys .
you know all this is poin@@ tless , don 't you ?
in the end , he 'll just retire over here with his cia pension ,
good evening , sir . ha@@ ther@@ ton welcomes you aboard .
thank you .
it 's my first time in a private jet .
well , let 's hope it 's not your last .
hi , man .
hey , bring my ghost a cal@@ v@@ ad@@ os .
yes , sir .
do you mind ?
leave it off for now .
ruth said you were in new york to see mad@@ do@@ x .
i 've never heard such utter balls in my entire life .
mike would never have believed such cra@@ p . he was too clever . too loyal .
mike betrayed you to ry@@ cart .
how do you know that ?
he told me .
you think it was just one guy doing all that work ?
do you mind if i don 't think about that ?
oh , jealous ?
i 'm not jealous .
i am .
but at least i know she 'll be having a long day at work .
well , at least we know brain surgery
you got to be more than 180 now .
i 'd like to see you get back under 145 .
excuse me , but thinking of you men in ti@@ ghts makes me want to ...
pu@@ ke .
there 's a flu going around the hospital .
somewhat ironic .
don 't push so hard .
can you lift your shirt ? so i can examine your stomach ?
cl@@ ai@@ re@@ . you 've had surgery recently .
these scars are still pink .
don 't tell my parents .
you did this in mexico so your parents wouldn 't know ?
what did you have done ?
and you noticed her foot twit@@ ching ?
come on , jam@@ ie .
my foot .
oh , yeah .
about three months ago ?
just a little .
we took her to county hospital , and she got the c.@@ t. scan ,
and the twit@@ ching has gotten worse ?
a lot worse . they don 't have the proper equipment back home
hunt them down if you can 't find them .
right away .
got the flu ?
yeah , and thanks for it .
it 's making my life so much easier .
i didn 't give it to you . it 's all over the hospital .
you should be in bed .
disease , diagnosis , and prescription from one man .
seriously . i 'll give you a ride home .
this is not gonna make me go home .
you go home .
but i feel fine .
not as up close as me@@ red@@ ith has .
what ? are you trying to get her in trouble ?
she 's our friend .
george , this program will make or break our careers , okay ?
some of us will make it through , and some of us won 't .
and that decision depends entirely
it 's not her fault , it 's shepherd 's .
he 's the attending . he should know better .
he 's taking advantage of her .
it didn 't exactly sound like
okay , we 're in good shape here .
i think so , dr. shepherd .
looks good .
here you go , doc .
hey , jam@@ ie , here 's what we 're gonna do .
we 're gonna put this on your arm , okay ?
isn 't that fun ?
here , we 're gonna put that onto you , like that .
and this is gonna feel cold .
this is a butterfly .
butterfly lands right there .
m@@ mm , there we go . blanket for the butterfly . good . nicely done .
it 's amazing stuff , isn 't it ?
hey , you like spac@@ es@@ hips ?
yeah .
you do ? okay , should we take captain o '@@ mal@@ ley ,
let 's go .
it 'll be safer to wait until your lunch di@@ ge@@ sts
i 'm just concerned .
where did you get the idea to do this ?
the internet .
honey , there is a healthy way to lose weight .
yeah , i tried that , but
what are you eating ?
and how much have you been working out ?
most of the time , when people hit their target weight ,
everyone gains weight in college , mom .
it 's ... stressful .
l just thought if i wasn 't worried about my diet , then ...
i could focus more on my studies .
so you took yet another short@@ cut ?
life doesn 't work that way , claire .
tina !
what ? you want to argue this ?
she has so much potential . if she would just apply herself
the condition has gotten radically worse
left untreated , the disease is gonna kill her .
how soon ?
too soon .
so , is there a cure ?
the treatment requires the dise@@ ased portion
see , eventually , the spinal fluid will fill the cavity .
her age makes it possible .
her brain 's not fully developed ,
but will she be normal ?
there are risks to any surgery ,
but if , you know , we 're successful ,
look , i know this is a lot to digest .
the important thing to remember is that we can save her life .
thank you .
dr. o '@@ mal@@ ley ?
yes ? what
but if the parents consent ,
are you in , or not ?
uh , in .
good .
yang .
get out ! i would kill for that .
we 're gonna cut out half a girl 's brain
it 's outrageous .
almost makes it hard to hate him .
why do you hate him ?
oh , no reason .
you know about him and me@@ red@@ ith ?
you know ?
when are you gonna figure out that i know everything ?
she knows .
i know .
we need to free the bo@@ wel from the adhe@@ sions caused from the ab@@ sc@@ ess .
this poor girl ...
what was she thinking ?
she wants her mother 's approval .
she wanted to please her .
and this damage is the result ?
well , getting proper nutrition will be a lifelong problem for claire .
great .
as if we already don 't have our hands full with her .
she gets good grades .
she stays out of trouble .
she 's smart .
i just think she feels like
you know , taylor , her anesthesia 's awful light .
come on , taylor , she 's waking up .
dr. taylor ?
uh , he 's asleep !
taylor !
dr. taylor !
oh , god , sorry . sorry , i 'm on it .
my bad , sh@@ ep .
he was right , wasn 't he ?
aw , i nodded off . come on .
whatever you got to do to get through the day , right ?
ste@@ ph , get me some coffee .
yes , doctor .
i 'll be fine . it won 't happen again .
yeah , not in here , it won 't .
uh , ste@@ ph , call dr. penn@@ ington .
hopkins , take over until she gets here .
get out of here and get it together .
what happened ?
i wish them the best of luck .
does that mean you believe he 's innocent ?
it means i believe in the process
whether it 's just or not
okay thank you very much warden .
and we will be here with you throughout the night .
thank you .
how long until ..
16 hours .
are his lawyers making any progress ?
is there still a chance with that ? no .
there 's only one person who can really stop this execution .
i need to see my brother .
just to tal@@ k.@@ for five minutes .
yeah . yeah . i 'll try .
ok ..
i 'm sorry .
i 'm told that you have to wait until final vis@@ itation .
would you talk to your father for me
believe me my father knows where i stand on the death penalty
sara .. dr. tan@@ cred@@ i i 'm sorry .
this isn 't about the morality of the death penalty .
this is ..
this is about killing an innocent man
just talk to lincoln 's attorneys
michael ,
and if i 'm the one asking for cle@@ men@@ cy for your brother
i 'm sorry .
yeah but a secret infor@@ mant claims that stead@@ man is still alive ?
i don 't know nick it all sounds pretty far-@@ fetched .
you 're his clerk just get us on the doc@@ ket .
nick you 're asking him to commit political suicide
if he grants it he can order a stay until the tests come in .
oh well that 's better . digging up the vice president 's brother .
no way .
ly@@ le ly@@ le look we took intr@@ o to ci@@ v pro together remember ?
we studied for the bar day and night in that c@@ rap@@ py little apartment of yours
nick you filed an 11@@ th-@@ hour motion
come on ly@@ le everyone knows you run that courtroom .
you can 't adjust things around a bit ?
the infor@@ mant that was killed yesterday i was there .
i know fir@@ sth@@ and these people will do whatever they can to frame lincoln for stead@@ man 's murder .
all we 're asking is to be heard .
i 'll give you 15 minutes this afternoon that 's it .
thank you .
he doesn 't even know what happened .
he knows you tried .
he 's your brother . he knows you .
so yes .
i promised i would get him out of here
enough man all right .
you don 't get a man 's hopes up like that and then just ...
back up or i 'll beat your skin@@ ny ass into the ground .
and it wouldn 't take much to do it .
all right ladies re@@ c time is over . back on the block !
you owe me a ticket out of here pretty .
and i will collect .
i 'm really sorry about your brother .
thanks .
look i know you were counting on this so ...
let me worry about my problems .
for what it 's worth over the years
once about 10 years ago
had to wait another three weeks while they reset the whole process .
and it may sound crazy
so take sol@@ ace in the fact that your brother 's wait is over .
so if something happens to the chair
there 's a lot of protocol in killing a man .
a new death warrant another medical clearance .
a lot can happen in three weeks .
yo what scrap@@ es yo ?
thanks .
but anything or anyone that could verify your story
i know time is of the essence .
i 'll reserve judgment for now . i 'll take your arguments into consideration
these little bast@@ ards are the bane of my existence i swear to god .
you get this a lot ?
yeah they 're attracted to the heat when they 're cold
and he shor@@ ted out the wire just by biting on it ?
not by chewing on the wire alone but if the tail touches metal
i 'll be dam@@ ned .
so can you change the fuse ?
yeah there 's another one right here in the box .
can you do it now ?
right after i notify the state and fill out the paperwork .
it 's a diap@@ er ?
yeah .
you need to wear it .
make me .
good look huh ? it 's for the electricity .
hair gets in the way or something .
i did everything i could .
i know you did .
last time i had my head sha@@ ved
remember derek ?
bet me 40 bucks i wouldn 't shave it .
i said make it $ 100 .
have you heard from ver@@ onica ?
she 's supposed to be coming .
is there any news on the appeal ?
this isn 't gonna happen .
i got to get my head straight .
let 's just share memories swap stories
i can 't take it anymore .
all right .
i have to see him .
you can 't go to the prison .
you 'll never make it through the gate .
there will be cops everywhere .
what 's that ?
i had a dream last night@@ .you and me were working on a house
and in the dream it felt like we were older .
it was so clear . the whole dream .
and when i woke i knew that today wasn 't going to be the end
i know it .
i love you dad .
they say he takes a lot of them to him .
him him ?
him him . and today he 's looking in tar@@ an@@ to .
what the fuck is he hoping to find with these losers ?
what the fuck are you saying , t@@ ama ' ? it 's good fishing out here .
they 're total slu@@ ts here .
they invited me to audi@@ tion for sal@@ a , as well .
we 're here to see sal@@ a . i 'm her manager .
no manager . just the girl .
all right . i 'll wait out here .
yeah , we 're coming , we 're coming . who 's there ?
s@@ onia , pat , then ... ? where are you ?
at the tim@@ one d '@@ oro ?
all right , 20 minutes .
sergio needs to finish something for work first .
unfortunately , you 're lacking two things , class and his acquaintance .
two details that will soon be resolved , fab@@ ri@@ z@@ io !
you 're throwing away your savings , sergio .
and you 'll go back to tar@@ an@@ to dirt poor .
well , in that case , have some , relax .
it 's so old-fashioned ! i haven 't touched coke for a good ten years .
so don 't get in the way . the girls love this old-fashioned stuff .
no , i understand .
what did you hear ?
nothing . you weren 't talking .
bravo ...
... sergio mor@@ ra .
you know me ?
you do everything you can to get yourself noticed .
so i 've studied you a bit , from a distance .
well , i like to keep busy .
in all these years , he has given us two things
but they 're not enough anymore .
what are you saying , san@@ tino ?
darling , could you look after the boy a moment ?
we 're talking seriously here .
lu@@ ig@@ ino , why don 't you drive around over there ?
and why don 't you fuck off ?
i 'm saying that we lost
explain this a bit more .
you may control six national tv networks ,
all those broken promises ..
people notice .
his collabor@@ ator sentenced to nine years for ties to the mafia .
people get pis@@ sed off .
he goes abroad and says ,
does it seems smart to you to go on tv and say ,
isn 't that true ?
of course it 's true . you can think it , but you don 't say it .
he 's 70 years old , cup@@ a .
his heart and prostate are wrecked , though he keeps using them ,
i know where you 're headed ,
i 'm not going to p@@ iss on my career by promoting an arrogant cocaine ad@@ dict .
fuck you , san@@ tino .
get the fuck off me , now . i will not cheat on my man .
what the fuck ?
what are you , 13 ?
i 've never cheated on sergio .
you just have , dear !
you 're a piece of shit !
and now people are going to p@@ iss on you .
because i 'll tell them everything , san@@ tino ,
where are you going ... . ?
do you have any wishes , sergio ?
some of my wishes have already come true .
yes ...
yes , i know , i know .
i mean , they 're totally incompetent !
where the hell are they going to go with that pathetic majority ?
i think you just need to be patient , you 'll be back in power soon .
are you bored , love ?
just because your arm is hurting , you think it 's going to fall off !
shall we do something after the bag@@ ag@@ lin@@ o show , darling ?
oh , that 's a shame , you have to go back .
yeah , ger@@ i was delighted .
don 't speak about him like that , love .
this cost me 300 euros and it looks like shit .
most powerful man in italy , time is money .
if only all you needed was a top to make the difference , love !
did you check me out properly , love ?
let 's hope this shit doesn 't go on too long . oh , god , here we go !
this isn 't politics , this is pus@@ sy .
how did you know , sil@@ vio ?
i don 't know anything , i understand .
an inde@@ fati@@ g@@ able lover of my calibre
well , that 's precisely what i want to talk to you about .
on one condition .. that you don 't om@@ it her name .
otherwise i 'll spend all my time trying to figure out who she is ,
tam@@ ara mor@@ ra . do you know her ?
by sight .
a good-@@ looking woman .
she 's two-@@ faced , sil@@ vio .
she urged me to stand as your successor
listen carefully , san@@ tino .
whoever is not with me is against me .
they 'll be kicked out the party and be@@ headed politically .
what is a salesman , sil@@ vio ?
two things . the salesman is a lonely man .
but we 're not interested in that because it would only de@@ press us .
so put that aside , but don 't forget it ,
we 're interested in the other thing .
who is this ?
augus@@ to pal@@ lo@@ tta , head of sales at pal@@ lo@@ tta real estate ltd .
and does this seem to you the time to call people to sell an apartment ?
yes , ma 'am ,
listen , i don 't have time to waste .
neither do i , ma 'am . if i 'm calling you now ,
i don 't need an apartment .
yes , ma 'am , everyone dreams of owning a home .
the self-@@ serving laws you had passed to further your economic interests
not because the weal@@ thi@@ est man in italy ,
and not because your politics are nothing more than populist propaganda
so if all these in@@ ferences of yours are not the reason ,
because i wanted to switch sides . that 's exactly the point !
the problem is that , while i waited for you , i remembered something .
what ?
what the writer javier mari@@ as said about you .
oh , god , another one ! what did this one have to say ?
he said that when you attend international summits ,
this is the reason i cannot side with you .
sil@@ vio , you hear how good she is ?
i studied whist@@ ling technique in dubai .
and she 's not just good , she 's beautiful .
and i brought her here because she 's dying to meet you .
bravo , fab@@ ri@@ z@@ io , but now you can take her back . you go as well , fab@@ ri@@ z@@ io .
dear ver@@ onica ,
come , dear .
i have a favourite writer as well .
din@@ o bu@@ zz@@ ati .
they 're all on holiday , who knows where ?
i don 't give a shit . round them up . you 're drowning in debt , fab@@ ri@@ z@@ io .
bring him the girls and i 'll convince him to help you .
you 'll help me ?
you 'll end up being treated like shit .
they want you , not him .
i can understand that .
there 's another thing , delicate and annoying .
it seems that a sort of handbook has been drawn up ,
no kisses , no hu@@ gs , no pat@@ s on the back ,
i do as i please .
my electors like the way i behave with other heads of state .
at least your jokes , sil@@ vio . could you at least avoid telling jokes ?
what do they have against jokes ?
what about churchill , then ?
he was famous for his jokes .
he 's a crazy , sick man . that 's what he is .
was that less mel@@ o@@ dramatic ?
remember what bor@@ bon@@ i said when she saw you in the theatre ?
" you were good , dear , just a shame i couldn 't hear anything ! "
not only were you no actress , but you were a b@@ im@@ bo , too ,
fine , but remember that this b@@ im@@ bo
look what you became !
maybe that 's why i felt the need for compan@@ ion@@ ship .
i built a financial and political empire .
fine , sil@@ vio , fine .
you 've spent a lifetime telling us and yourself how brilliant you are !
we 've had enough of it . and you want to know something else ?
it 's not true .
it 's not true you 're as skil@@ ful as you say you are .
your skill as a businessman consists in having cheated your whole life .
you are so naive !
what do you think every other businessman ,
do you think they 're all blessed with righteousness except for me ?
let me tell you a truth
they 're all like me .
they 're all prepared either to go around obstacles or knock them down .
but i did it better than the rest of them , because i am the best .
you 're just a child who 's afraid of dying .
but i have a duty to be completely honest with you .
you 're not good .
come back soon .
if i come back later , it 's because i won .
then you 'll be back soon .
why won 't they let me govern ?
why won 't they let me run this country the way i did my companies ?
instead the lef@@ tist judges tor@@ ment me with trials ,
i don 't understand it .
what did you expect ?
that you could be the richest man in the country ,
yes , that 's exactly what i expected .
well , you never got off that cruise ship where we played as kids .
or maybe i never got on it .
you know something ?
a few days ago , in some magazine ,
and i noticed ...
they all look like ver@@ onica .
why don 't you try again , sil@@ vio ?
one day there was a girl here .
stell@@ a she was called .
i approached her and she said to me ..
just be yourself . no , i 'm going to be exactly what they want me to be .
" anchor . "
a reliable or principal support ,
i believe i can do that for your viewers
tell us more about yourself
i studied journalism at the university of texas .

you really shouldn 't use hand san@@ iti@@ zer like that . it dri@@ es out your skin .
oh , what sweater should i wear ?
the one with fl@@ oral or the one with fl@@ oral ?
the mood swings .
they can be so bad sometimes .
high , low . you never know where you 're gonna go .
throwing things , hitting me .
but i love you no matter what
were you smoking ?
i can smell it on you ! go take a shower , for christ 's sa@@ kes .
do you want some pan@@ cakes ?
pan@@ cakes !
i know you hate butter .
yes . will you eat anything ?
anything ?
see , dam@@ on eats .
dam@@ on fucking eats . and he keeps it in .
you 're not going to rehearsal on friday
when you were a .. just a little baby ,
i 've never heard you say that without a cross@@ bow in your hand .
i can 't wait till we get that money .
think of all the stuff we could buy .
american tooth@@ paste .
some toilet paper so we can stop using our bath mat .
caroline , you hold on to this
why are you giving it to her ?
i mean , you really think she can keep a secret
well , you don 't want me to have it .
if i know , i 'll spoil it .
i have no poker face .
neither did my mom , which is how i became
caroline , i 'm warning you .
don 't let it slip .
even if i beg you , don 't tell me .
okay .
that 's why i didn 't want to give it to her .
your dad wrote and directed this thing too ?
d@@ ang , he 's like the ben aff@@ lec@@ k of jail .
yi@@ kes , it says here
oh , my god . that 's terrible .
we 're seeing an under@@ study ?
oh , look ! my dad 's opening the show .
steel bars
steel bars on our balls
well , we won 't keep you prisoner much longer .
so we 're just gonna take a brief inter@@ mission ,

that was incredible , dad !
especially the escape attempt scene .
" shan@@ ks for nothing " ?
he sure is a big man on his blog ,
well , i would have gone with " it 's a prison riot . "
all right , well , here you go .
here 's your envelope ,
i 'm real sorry to hear about you and max .
unless maybe it 's a good thing
why does every single person keep telling me
all right , it 's just max and you .
here . let me do that .
listen , honey .
you only have to work on wall street , okay ?
you can live on the upper east side
daddy , did you and max talk about this ?
kit@@ ten , i know you better than anybody ,
you could still be friends with max .
she like tennis ?
how do you know where i belong ?
what we do is fucking hard , alright ?
now can i watch this fucking in peace
fuck .
yeah , go on . pick one .
that one ?
okay !
pay day , love ?
here , how much you charging anyway ?
what did you just say ?
mum@@ my 's gonna show you how to eat sp@@ ag@@ he@@ tti .
spoon . fork .
no , lucy , not with your fingers !
mum@@ my !
so i said to myself , " who are my two best men ? "
i had just made dinner
believe me , i 'm a mother too .
after dinner at our house ,
there was evidence of
i had wine with dinner .
how much , would you say ?
i know these questions may seem intrusive , mrs. collins ,
i am aware that your husband died .
he was murdered .
i 'm very sorry .
it must be difficult for you .
my husband being murdered ?
yes , quite difficult .
i mean coping .
what , with the fact that the police
and the trun@@ ks begin to slip and slide .
when nur@@ sey falls on to the floor in a ...
heap .
and mum@@ my tells you to let her ..
sleep !
you want to talk about endless patience ?
penny made me watch all five seasons
there are six seasons , dude .
oh , cra@@ p !
no , no , no , the sixth season is great .
we go to paris with carrie and get our heart broken ,
it 's a wild ride .
door .
c@@ j , where are you going ?
we 're supposed to play here .
what 's happening in chicago ?
tell me everything . go away .
are you guys going out ?
i barely made it to the age of eleven , before
are you pis@@ sing , right now ?
look at him , he is pis@@ sing
no pis@@ sing in the scho@@ oly@@ ard !
even the teacher started doing it .
yeah , mam@@ ai he does that
well , my friend , i know an indian
it must be fate that the two of you should meet . "
so what has mam@@ a@@ ji already told you ?
he said you had a story that would make me believe in god .
he would say that about a nice meal .
as for god , i can only tell you my story .
you 'll decide for yourself what you believe .
fair enough .
let 's see then . where to begin ?
pon@@ dic@@ her@@ ry
spectacle .
don 't let the stories and pretty lies fool you , boys .
religion is darkness .
my dear apa believed himself part of the new india .
as a chil@@ ds he 'd had polio .
he used to lie in bed w@@ rac@@ ked with pain ,
in the end , god didn 't save him .
my am@@ ma went to college
religion was the only tin@@ k she had to her past .
ur religion was the : only ink she had to her past .
ur religion was the only link she h
it was a third there , ra@@ vi and i were terribly bored .
challenge . i give you two ru@@ pe@@ es .
run into that church , and drink the holy water .
you must be thirsty
why would a god do that ?
why would he send his own son
d e@@ al@@ ul@@ se e o es s
but we can understand god 's son ,
if god is so perfect , and we are not
i came to faith through hindu@@ ism ,
but god wasn 't finished with me yet .
god works in mysterious ways .
and so it was he introduced him to me again ,
my arabic was never very good .
but the sound and feel of the words brought me closer to god .
in performing " sal@@ ah , " the ground i touched became hol@@ ly ground ,
are you out of your mind ?
who gave you the permission to come back here ?
you just ignored everything i 've ever taught you ?
i-i just wanted to say hello to him .
you think that tiger is your friend .
he 's an animal , not a play@@ mate !
that tiger ... is not your friend .
when you look into his eyes ,
nothing else .
you stupid . say " i 'm sorry . "
you know what your father said about coming back here ?
i am sorry .
i was
this is between a father and his sons .
he said he 's sorry . you 'll just scare them for life .
scare them ? that boy almost lost his arm .
but he 's just a boy .
he will be a man sooner than you think .
and this is a lesson i do not want them ever to forget !
we are doing this for you and ra@@ vi .
come inside and have some din@@ er .
vegetarian , please .
oh , my sons and i are vege@@ tari@@ ans .
do you have anything ... no no no no no !
not for grav@@ y .
you don 't want grav@@ y ?
hello .
i am happy bud@@ dist .
so i eat rice next to grav@@ y .
i 'm sure , grav@@ y is not meat .
it 's taste . you try ?
don 't worry .
we will have plenty of fresh supplies after we stop in manila .
why give orange juice tranqu@@ il@@ izers ?
he 's not gonna cause any trouble .
the stress of traveling is not good for the animals ,
we don 't want to be cleaning up ,
do we
hey . get rid of me !
it 's my bed .
it was a human tooth .
don 't you see the island was carni@@ vorous ?
carni@@ vorous ? like a venus ely trap ?
yes . the whole island .
the plants , the water and those pools , the very ground itself
but at night , some chemical process
i filled my stores with fresh water ,
i couldn ' leave without him , of course
and so i waited for his return .
i knew he wouldn 't be ate
no one has seen that floating island since .
and you won 't read about those trees in any nature book .
and yet , if i hadn 't found those shores , i would have died .
and if i hadn 't discovered that tooth ,
even when god seemed to have abandoned me , he was watching .
even when he seemed indifferent to my suffering , he was watching .
and when i was beyond all hope of saving ,
and gave me a sign to continue my journey .
by the time we reached the mexican shore ,
my strength was gone , i was so weak .
i was afraid that in two feet of water
i struggled to shore , and fei upon the sand .
it was warm and so@@ it ,
and somewhere , two eyes were smiling , that having me there .
ii was so spent , i could hardly move .
the cook threw me a life buo@@ y and pull me aboard ,
the cook ... was a dis@@ gus@@ ting man .
ee ate a rat !
we had food enough for weeks ,
just a bru@@ te bad man .
but he was resource@@ ful
it was a week later that he
" ni@@ pol@@ a ! "
here wasn 't anything i could do .
couldn 't look away ...
couldn 't look away
he threw her body over@@ board ,
next day , i killed him .
e didn i even fight back , he knew he 'd gone too far
jesus , dave ! your mom 's making ve@@ gan cra@@ p for dinner . i wanted meat !
i 'm not making anything else !
the die never lie .
i 'd play your dragons or whatever if you asked me to .
that would be hil@@ arious .
you 're serious ?
y not ? you make it sound like ..
i don 't know , i 'm just saying that i 'd play if you asked .
when , exactly ?
can you hang on a second .
it 's a shower night tonight , so lights out at 9 : 30 .
it wouldn 't kill you to wash a dish either .
hey . nothing really . it 's just the usual .
my brother is a s@@ nar@@ ling ball of anger and my sister is ..
herself .
good times .
" dishes . "
she just wants to play with you .
embarrassing me in front of my friends ?
dave , u 're on that thing all the time .
barbara is reaching out , and that 's good .
no , it 's weird and stupid !
why do you care ... loud or she 'll hear us talking .
okay .
so ur is twenty miles tall ,
he 's the only one .
s so lonely that in his anguish ,
giving birth
the first dark kings of the earth .
at least that 's what they liked to think .
giants are ver@@ min ,
but huge , of course .
they can hit thirty feet and come in all flavors .
giants have hair of living ice ,
sw@@ amp giants will clear out a whole village of people ,
mountain giants ba@@ the in the blood of children ,
h@@ ese cre@@ eps , they 're harb@@ ing@@ ers .
they just like to watch . totally sket@@ chy .
you see a harb@@ inger , a giant is around .
even worse , though , tit@@ ans .
these are the big guys .
like greek myth stuff .
hold on . you need to see what we 're dealing with .
giants aren 't real .
then why are you swe@@ ating ?
there you have it .
can 't compete with a baby deer .
once they find food they don 't go for the bait .
we 're going to have to track it .
i want to see if it took a bite out of this guy , though .
the giant killer .
see , you never give up , barbara .
h i could have seen those games .
but then you 'd be old .
anny said i could use the table .
why weren 't you at school ?
has something to do with a charter i did in seattle .
what i do know is their end game
and once that happens ,
but i don 't want to involve you in this mess .
that 's way too dangerous .
i 'm not asking your permission , james .
i can do this on my own ,
i don 't understand everything that 's going on ,
let 's see what we can discover about them .
find out what their plan is , see what they 're all about .
they 're trying to get you out , and you don 't trust them ?
i don 't trust any of these guys .
be wise and take advantage .
now , can you fix the electricity
it 's not that simple .
the water pipes are inside the prison .
the electrical lines are probably running underground
hey , lin@@ c .
look , br@@ o , um , i 'm going to be out of your way real soon .
i saw these fl@@ yers for migrant workers in colombia .
it 's coffee bean season ,
bus leaves today , okay ?
all right , well , before you get out of here , man , i
lin@@ c , uh i appreciate everything you 've done
just a couple hours , that 's it .
when i was 15 , my cousin told me about a job that only lasts
i 'm in panama , i don 't speak the language
i 'm going ake money and send it home .
underground or not , i 'm going to be a dad , lin@@ c ,
i spoke to james .
he confirmed what you told me
you and i , we both have people in there
please let me help you .
your spanish as good as your english ?
yes , colonel .
i just have one favor to ask .
it 's just outside of the gate .
you , you can bring your men .
thank you for arranging this for us , colonel .
i 'm getting something out of this as well ,
you know you can fix this electric problem ?
i won 't know for sure until we can start digging ,
my men will shoot you in i back of the head
and you , patron , if anything goes wrong .
it will not only be his life that is lost .
you have my word on that .
no worries , colonel .
i 'll keep this boy in line .
i 'll dig .
i don 't need your help .
hey , come on , now , don 't be proud .
i heard you talking just yesterday .

what is it , a " 66 or a ' 67 ?
i 'm gave him the sho@@ vels . get him out .
i gave him sho@@ vels too , and guys to work with , just like you .
i worked in the prison he broke out of .
he said he was doing me a favor
and you know what i got ?
ho@@ g-@@ tied and left in a pipe under my own prison .
there 's nothing he can do .
the soldiers are watching him .
that 's what i thought ,

now all we have
thank you .
hey , brother . want a cold one ?
i got a long-term deal here , kind of come and go as i please .
i seen a lot of crazy shit but never a murder .
one of the kids finally said something to the owner .
i guess he did it to her earlier in the day .
where 'd you do your time , br@@ o ?
them girls your ni@@ ec@@ es ?
yeah . yeah , we 're on vacation .
i was .. i was wondering if you 're looking for work at all
yeah , what you got , kid ?

place is a drug ju@@ g . i know the cleaning lady .
what ? you take down doctors ?
i am a thief , and i 'm a real , real good one .
this guy has a sam@@ pler pharmacy on the premises .
what do you need me for ?
i need somebody to front a van , help me move it .
i got all the clients , but , you know ,
someone like you at the table when the deal goes down ,
you seem like a good kid , but you got the wrong idea .
we 're just down for some sun and waves .
you could take care of them girls a lot better
you don 't need 10 grand , man ?
not where i 'm going .
thanks for the beer .
who is this ?
you know who this is , you son of a bitch .
you took pictures of my lungs .
yes . i remember , mr. cade .
how long do i have ?
i can 't say . i just
you need to come back in .
we need . roy , you didn 't we need to do a biop@@ sy .
you just left , and we ..
you want to forget magic ?
then why did you keep the ring ?
i was going to sell that on e@@ bay .
you 're still a bad liar , dave . i like that about you . it 's a good sign .
you have the gift .
no , i have a life .
you 're the last person hor@@ v@@ ath saw with the gri@@ m@@ hold .
that puts you on his list .
so unless you want him to turn you into a pig who just loves physics ,
this is crazy . you see how crazy this is , right ?
all right . all right .
you help me get it back , you 're done .
really ?
you can walk away .
can you please put my dresser back ?
wh@@ oa , wh@@ oa , wh@@ oa , wh@@ oa !
what are you .. oh , no .
please don 't do that . what are you doing ?
what ?
wh@@ oa . what is that ?
here we go . all right . move .
sorry about that . it 's just nice for them to see a genuine icon like me .
fortunately , they 'll all be dead soon .
and before that , we need to find the boy .
well , how do we do that ?
we 'll wait until he 's alone .
now , focus on control . set me down slow and steady .
dave ? it 's bec@@ ky .
i 'll be back shortly .
could you please hide ? hide now . please .
dave , get back here .
we have important work to do .
where is she ?
she ?
he hasn 't told you , has he ?
the truth about who 's inside the doll ?
sweetheart , you 've put your faith in the wrong man .
tell me , have you ever been in love ?
you 're in love right now . i can see it in your eyes .
no , no , no , no . don 't deny it .
i wonder what would happen
shut up .
you 'd be no better than the rest of us .
this polluted , dirty piece of earth ?
i imagine i want it for the same reason you did .
i 'm in the garment business , so i take that as a testament .
but i inherited this property from my uncle .
sadly , he had no children of his own .
he was the one that let them put these tanks up here .
so , you see , this place .... can do nothing for me .
i offered to lease this site to you for a very fair price
why is that ?
i like to own the things i use .
i can see that
you gonna check on the new house ?
yeah , i 'll see you back home .
do you need anything else ?
okay .
i 'll be here to pick you up when you get out .
thank you .
these men are co@@ wards .
they 're too weak to make a living or even fight with their own hands .
and too stupid to think of anything else to do .
so , you guys have done what you needed to ?
i 'm sorry ?
well , you just said you 've done what you needed to do .
so , what is it that you 've done ?
i 'm not exactly sure , you know . i just got here at 4 : 00 .
my shift 's actually up , so ..
right .
so , you 've done nothing ?
hey , why 'd they want it ?
they wanted the $ 6,000 worth of fuel that was in it .
trucks 14 through 23 are on the road .
thirty to 33 are just about ready to go .
nick , the gas@@ ket 's good . you should get over there and get going
to try to help our business and the city .
but also know that i have never taken anything from anyone .
so when you say that we 've ...
we 're on the same side here .
well , yes and no .
and because of that , i don 't really feel comfortable sitting here ..
pretending like the elephant per@@ ched on the corner of my desk isn 't there .
so , you know , i can 't go into specifies right now ...
but we believe that you and your company have broken the law
so next week we will be bringing a case against you .
it 's a little awkward , obviously ...
but , i didn 't want to have this happen next week
you know , out of respect .
you have your job to do .
but know that you 're wrong .
and we will take advantage of every opportunity to prove that .
abel !
exactly .
caused by the drift of soft sil@@ t from the sides of the
sure .
what is that ?
it 's a gun .
it 's a fucking gun .
where did you get that ?
your youngest daughter found it in the bushes outside our front door .
she was playing with it .
look . it 's loaded . with the safety off
it was a fucking go@@ on with a loaded gun looking in our window .
we 've just pushed it a little too far , that 's all .
let 's look at it like a badge of honor .
we 're big enough now they even give a shit about us .
you need to go home right away ...
and start going through our set of books .
how far back are they going
i 'll get into it .
one other thing . the bank .
i need you two to sit down with them . i set up a dinner .
i want you both there . just be up front . be honest .
i don 't anticipate a problem .
god knows they 've given money to bigger cro@@ o@@ ks than us .
jesus . all right .
that these are dangerous times and we have to adapt .
it 's not like when we was driving
not well .
he feels very strongly about it .
t can see that .
i don 't think he fully understands .
what is there to understand
well , first of all , it 's illegal .
it 's not illegal if i say it isn 't .
my responsibility is to provide ..
safe and timely passage of goods and products
we need to close this deal .
we cannot stay like this any longer .
we have to close on that property .
we 're so weak right now .
why do you want this so badly ?
because i 've got my entire savings at risk on this deposit .
no , no , no , no . i don 't mean the deposit .
i mean .. this . why do you want it ?
have you ever thought about it ?
yes , i 've thought about it . i 've thought about it every day for the last five years .
that place has just been sitting right across that fence moc@@ king me .
i 'm not talking about that place .
i-@@ i-i just meant everything
i have no idea what you mean .
what 'll we play ?
here you go .
as you can see , i 'm in the middle of my daughter 's birthday party .
i understand and i apologize . i do .
but this is a warrant , and we need to gain complete access to the property
let me check something .
js he serious ?
i 'm gonna fucking kill this guy .
they got a birthday party going on .
abel . he 's saying it 's a bad time .
maria . keep the kids playing
anna morales .
may i speak with you for a minute ?
i understand you and your men have a job to do here .
but we 're in the middle of a 10-@@ year-old 's birthday party .
this is probably one you 're gonna regret .
excuse me ?
my husband 's an honorable man .
we 're not who you think we are .
i think i know your father .
good for you .
my husband is not my father .
not even close .
so if i were you ...
i would start treating us with a little more respect .
or i guarantee ..
he will make it his mission in life to ruin you .
this was very dis@@ respectful .
and you 're not gonna find a fucking thing .
trucks 14 through 23 are on the road
six , what are you doing back here ?
hey . how are you ?
look , there 's a door down here about four more flights .
you come out under the bridge . it 's a park .
fuck you !
you 're welcome .
where 's the truck now ?
it 's still up on the bridge
ka@@ thy , it 's me . what are you talking about ? what shots ?
it 's 16 . someone shot up his truck on the 59th street bridge .
do you know how long it took me to pay you off ?
seven months . six and a half
i put 40 % down deposit on this property
because you said that you would be there .
you now have three serious separate pending legal cases against you ..
one with 16 counts of misconduct .
ranging from fraud to tax evasion .
and then today , in the middle of our meeting
which led to a shoot out on the 59th street bridge .
so , i should start by thanking you ...
for your assistance in attempting to bring in the driver .
yeah , we didn 't expect him to react that way .
yeah , well , the officers there didn 't set it up very well on their end either .
i 'm sorry .
miss lan@@ ge .
it has been brought to our attention ..
that it might be beneficial on your end
it 's a possibility .
so we have prepared an offer for you to review .
i 'll present it to him .
it 's good , andrew
need more time .
of course you do .
i know our agreement doesn 't allow for that .
but i need more time .
and i should say that we feel fairly certain ...
after a very frank conversation ..
that the guys who are doing this
as you know , there are plenty of other smaller providers in the area ..
that might have something to do with it who are not here tonight , so .
peter , thank you .
thank you . that may be true .
but i don 't think it 's as bad as they 're saying it is .
i guess i kind of knew what i was doing
got us three more days .
that 's great .
and i got a piece from saul .
when i was putting them to bed tonight ..
i told them that their dad was out there
i said that whatever he wanted
and that there was no man
this is all worth it .
of course .
hey .
i didn 't know you were coming
you 've grown .
you saw me a month ago .
i know . i know . but you have .
te@@ sus .
i don 't know how you get any work done around here .
that 's how much has been taken from me over the last six months
your far rock@@ away facility bought a load of fuel .
off of one of my stolen trucks last week .
that 's not possible .
arnold
just thinking about the co@@ wards that have done this ..
now , as you know , texas number four is marked .
do you have any receipts over the last year ...
for incoming marked number four ?
so i 'm gu@@ essing there 's at least , what
i said .... . 2@@ 13,000 .
i said . 2@@ 13,000 .
i need a day .
okay .
but i was just buying the stuff off these guys .
i ... i-i only bought a couple loads .
i don 't know who they are . i would never do that .
this may ruin me .
my goal was to have you out of business by the end of next year .
but if you 're this fucking desperate
abel . i wasn 't the only person buying this shit .
all right , well , when you find out who else did it
but i need the whole lot by tomorrow morning ..
or you 're gonna have the fe@@ ds at your door@@ step by noon .
there he is .
i don 't want you to be in this position .
we are not nice people to borrow three quarters of a million dollars from .
t know that .
you know , i 'm ... i 'm gonna think about this .
you know , we should both think about this .
oh , got this at the goodwill store for 50 cents .
can you believe it ?
50 cents sounds right .
let 's go .
you know , it 's kin@@ da late .
why don 't we just spend the night here ?
because we don 't live here .
i know .
do you ? you said when you got back from space
that 's not true .
howard , i 'm doing laundry !
you want me to put anything in for you ? !
there 's some underwear in the hamper !
oh , good ! i got that new stain stick to try out !
thank you ! i only put it on the list two weeks ago !
okay , i see what you 're getting at :
thank you .
that place really did remind me of my hometown .
because there we also have a hometown buffet .
hold on . wi@@ l and amy had an argument ?
yes , quite the ker@@ fu@@ ffle .
then amy got mad and left ?
walked right out the door .
and you .... ?
enjoyed a delightful dinner at a reasonable price .
the manager recognized wi@@ l
right next to it !
buddy , i think amy might be upset .
why 's that ?
because your friend was rude to her ,
you 're just repeating what i said .
it 's like living with a lac@@ to@@ se-@@ in@@ tolerant par@@ rot .
trust me , call her .
fine . it 's a shame you didn 't go to dinner with us ,
i was this close .
what ?
you 'll appreciate this .
leonard has some ridiculous notion that you 're mad at me .
tell him you 're not mad at me .
go ahead , set him straight .
the new enterprise heads out on its maiden voyage
enter wes@@ ley crus@@ her , played by my buddy ...
an end of an era .
boy , if these walls could talk .
they 'd say , " why does he touch himself so much ? "
i can 't believe i 'm not going to live here anymore .
this has always been my bedroom .
right here is where my mom used to mark my height .
sixth grade .
seventh grade .
eighth grade .
ninth grade .
i remember when i was five ,
came home , celebrated with a sn@@ ick@@ ers ,
when did you figure out you were allergic to nuts ?
sometime around the third al@@ mond joy .
okay .
you want to start loading this stuff into the truck ?
yeah , i guess .
hey , would you do me a favor ?
go on ahead .
i just want one last moment alone in my old room .
we 're not standing outside by the u-@@ haul
fine , let 's go .
what brings you in ?
penny , if you wouldn 't mind ,
are you finally getting fu@@ z@@ z in weird places ?
penny , please ,
will that calm my nerves ?
it 's cal@@ med the pants off me a couple of times .
sold .
so , the heart you got from the wizard giving you trouble ?
the trouble isn 't with me , penny ,
someday , scientists will discover
yeah , amy told me what happened .
look , just apologize .
it 's a ban@@ d-@@ aid at best .
the core problem is that amy and wi@@ l do not like each other .
which is baff@@ ling because they 're both crazy about me .
and i like them ,
honey , you can 't make people like each other .
not true .
leonard made me like you .
and let me tell you , that was a hard row to hoe .
cheers , pal .
boy , that is a treat that 's hard to beat .
get the mad hat@@ ter on the horn , i 'm having a tea party .
you might want to pace yourself .
i drink tea all the time .
i think i know what i 'm doing .

they 're losing their homes to global warming ,
what is pink cheeks ?
it 's intimate wa@@ xing . quit looking at that !
maybe you should find someone
like a business manager ?
no , absolutely not .
you can 't afford to hire someone
that is a foolish expense , and i forbid it .
what if there 's someone who just likes controlling
we don 't know , his mother never had him tested .
you 're talking about me . very funny .
although i would enjoy drawing up a budget
wait , wait , who 's gonna break it to the pengu@@ in ?
okay , shel@@ don .
yeah , i 'm putting you in charge of my finances .
i will not spend another penny that you don 't authorize .
very well .

oh , better luck next time , pink cheeks .
when there 's hair growing out of it , that 's a mole . "
i should hope so .
when she called me an in@@ sensitive jer@@ k ,
there 's got to be other ways you can make a quick buck .
yeah , you 'd think .

i really should wear a bell around my neck

the poor guy has had two wives kill themselves .
and here i was concentrating all my pity on the dead people .
susan , be careful .

but that kidney gave me a second chance in life ,
i feel that paul deserves the same thing .

why is the glass always half empty with you ?
hey , i don 't know why i didn 't think of this sooner .
i just got my budget .
you 'd let us do that ? you 're amazing !
that would be huge for our company .
look , i know this new job 's put a bit of a strain on us .
this might be a good way to sne@@ ak in
so you think you can do something for 20 grand ?
this may be the dog sham@@ poo talking ,
and wh@@ ack an employee of your choosing .
hey , room@@ ie !

oh , don 't try to make this my fault .
blocking my dri@@ ve@@ way is illegal .
yes , but breaking into my car is criminal .
really ? let 's call 9-@@ 1-@@ 1 .
i 'd love to get a policeman 's opinion on that .
you just did .
oh , my . you are a policeman .
hmm ? i wasn 't paying attention . what were you telling ' em ?
girls , get back here !

and i will not give up .
neither will they . b@@ ree .
neither will they .
wow , if i knew tom was working with so many handsome rich men ,
will you look at this ? he 's kept us waiting 45 minutes .
good to see being married to the boss gave us the leg up .
ah . if he keeps us waiting any longer ,
sorry about the wait .
i just got off the phone with london .
closed a deal worth $ 10 million . phy@@ ll@@ is ?
okay , ladies , i have 15 minutes ,
the overall look we 're going for is very warm and inviting .
we 're thinking soft wood , an over@@ stuffed linen sofa .
that sounds great , but i already know what i want .
ripped that out of a magazine .
this is donald trump 's office .
isn 't it cool ?
i was missing beth so much , and ...
then i remembered that p@@ ant of her was still alive somewhere .
could you spare a few minutes
smells good .
oh , it 's for paul . chicken pot pie .
right . you said you were cooking for him .
that 's so thoughtful .
well , just trying to be a good friend .
i hope that we can be friends , too .
you do ?
you and me ? friends ?
i know what you 're thinking .
what i did to paul was horrible ,
and now i just want things back to normal .
this smells wonderful .
i wouldn 't begin to know how to make a pot pie .
well , the crust is sto@@ re-@@ bought .
but don 't tell paul , okay ?
don 't you worry .
i know how to keep a secret .
" with repeated small doses of the toxin ,
" initial symptoms include nausea and vomiting .
these are followed by metabolic ac@@ id@@ osis
as if he had one .
" and finally , acute renal failure and ..
death . "
or at least that last little piece of you
it just goes to show ...
you may be gone ...
but we 're still one hec@@ k of a team .
susan , how 's he doing ?
i don 't get it . he just keeps getting worse and worse .
i think i 'm gonna have to start bringing him breakfast , too .
you 're a good friend .
if you stick to my system ,
hey , swee@@ tie .
you can relax . she went upstairs .
no , i have to get this done .
do you want a cup@@ cake ?
mrs. van de kam@@ p says those are for after dinner .
well , mrs. van de kam@@ p isn 't here .
i 'm not saying i love this more than you and cel@@ ia ,
here . sne@@ ak this upstairs . eat it later .

uh , what 's going on ? i told the mo@@ vers to be here at 11 : 00 .
we 're supposed to be a team .
i almost bought you
but you didn 't .
yeah , and i felt bad about it ...
till now .
i 've got two dragon lamps in my car .
what the hell am i supposed to do with those ?
i 'm sor@@ ry@@ . but trust me ,
how ? tom said what he wants .
tom said what he thinks he wants .
i know what he really wants .
and you have to admit ,
we got a 9-@@ 1-@@ 1 call from 2 girls
what ?
hello again .
i guess you found someone to loan you that gun .
okay .
i spoke with the girls . they 're pretty sure
well , that 's pre@@ poster@@ ous .
why would they say such a thing ?
well , that 's not all they said .
ga@@ by ? what 's with the pan@@ icked ph@@ o calls ?
it 's nothing .
the girls got all fre@@ aked out and called the police .
did you tell her that , sir ?
i think i know what this is .
me and the girls were talking about my mother 's death ,
they must have gotten confused .
yeah , well , don 't be mad at them .
it 's hard on kids when their parents are apart .
it 's actually kind of funny if you think about it .
i mean , not " funny " funny , but sad ... funny .
daddy !
hey , girls ...
so sorry to have dragged you out here in the middle of the night .
let me walk you to your car .
let 's go pack your stuff . i 'm taking you home .
i 'm glad you didn 't kill someone .
i 'd have felt pretty dumb
uh , tell me something . when someone calls 9-@@ 1-@@ 1 .
i was at dispatch when the call came through .
when i heard the address , i said , " i 'll take it . "
really :
your neighbor , mrs. till@@ man . here 's my card .
if you see anything suspicious , i want you to call me .
okay .
i never have a clue what you 're thinking .
i 'm a detective . i find clues . i don 't give them .
good night , citizen .
good night , detective .
they are almost done packing .
i can 't believe you told them .
ju@@ an@@ ita wanted to know why we were fighting .
i told her the truth .
great . so now they think mommy walked out on daddy
i 'm sorry . i just keep waiting for this to blow over .
we have to face it , ga@@ by .
this is never gonna blow over .
so what am i gonna do ?
you 're gonna go home to your husband .
i feel guilty enough about carlos losing his mother .
i will not be responsible for him losing his wife .
i would really love to observe if that 's cool with you .
no , that 's not cool .
now if you 'll excuse me ,
if you don 't eat , i can do it today .
did you hear mer just revolution@@ ized the world of cu@@ tl@@ ery ?
no , i ... did not .
working on a liver model .
are you still going to try to remove all of the tumors today ?
it just seems like it 's a lot to do all at once .
will 's cancer is a very aggressive sar@@ coma .
it 's an all-@@ or-@@ nothing approach .
we 've come up with a plan to remove all of them ,
some will be a snap , but there are a few tricky ones ,
it 's deep in the liver , but we 'll do our best to get it .
we 'll get it .
we 'll try .
um , it 's sort of like trying to get past level six .
you know , there are some , uh , fighters ,
we will eat all those dots and kill all those ghosts .
she doesn 't play video games .
what are you doing here ?
oh , i switched with kno@@ x .
uh . ben warren .
uh , i don 't know if we met before i left .
oh , oh i was actually at your wedding .
i got you that pizza stone .
we have a pizza stone ?
yeah , i got you , a , uh , a circular clay stone
it 's kind of my standard gift .
oh , well then this will change your life .
the crust that always stick to the edges never get burned .
you can really tell the difference ?
you broke scru@@ b .
i 'm sorry ?
your left hand dropped below the sterile field .
go re-@@ scru@@ b .
i didn 't move my hand ...
yes ...
it did . i saw it .
you want to call me a liar ,
mir@@ an@@ da@@ . you need a minute ?
i need a quiet o.@@ r. so we can begin .
10 blade .
right here .
i have to go away from you now .
ready with tumor number one .
okay , you see that ?
already going great . one down ..
14 to go . i wish we had gotten to him sooner .
he was diagnosed already stage iv .
typical teenager .
he ignored his symptoms ,
and now he 's got an abdomen completely covered with tumors .
well , you 're right . he is a typical teenager ,
he 's strong , able to fight . and what 's better ?
what ?
you should print a spoon next .
that way we 'll be able to reach tumor number two .
it is an anatom@@ ically correct liver model with a portal vein .
it 's a plastic bl@@ ob@@ .i 'm starving .
can they print food or just uten@@ sils ?
when will the model be done ?
10 , maybe 12 hours .
that long ?
it 's life-saving technology . sh@@ ane .
if you want it faster , page god .
it 's a fake organ . how long for functional items ?
like an actual vascular graft ?
like a pre@@ tz@@ el .
good .
in japan , they 're 3-@@ d making condu@@ its
u@@ h-@@ huh . y@@ ay . japan .
why can 't we do that ?
why can 't we use a 3-@@ d printer to create
he wouldn 't need surgery after surgery
just concentrate on one thing at a time .
we fix the hole .
then we move on to the next step .
it 's just a routine complication .
that happens .
everything 's under control . we 're good .
you good , miranda ?
thank you .
put it to the left , dum@@ bass .
what ?
are you a half
i said place it to the left , idiot .
those are things mark slo@@ an used to say
are we taking a walk down memory lane now ?
you know , i convinced him to start teaching you .
you 're a full-@@ wit . now you have to start teaching the residents .
hand them the keys .
all right , i get it . point made .
i know . it 's just so fun .
there she is . number eight .
right sm@@ ack in the middle of the liver .
let 's skip it .
skip it ? why would we do that ?
we 'll come back to it .
no , we planned this surgery in an order .
we should stick to it .
alex , if we remove the other ones first ,
let 's just come back to it .
it 's the hardest one .
if it turns out we can 't remove it ,
ah , you still have the ring .
but you 're seeing other people , obviously .
um , yeah . we are .
i 'm so sorry . that was way too personal .
i just out of a job interview
i 'm just not used to it .
uh , we don 't do things like this at seattle pre@@ s .
well , then , come work here .
because we do way too personal on a daily basis .
we 'll isolate the vessels ,
i can do it .
i don 't know if you can , mer .
it might be better just to close him .
no blue .
nice work , you guys .
let 's also get a bubble test .
do we need both ?
we need to be absolutely sure that there 's no leak .
if there 's a breakdown somewhere in the an@@ ast@@ om@@ osis ,
is that what you want for the patient , wilson ?
no , ma 'am .
you know , bubble test only takes a second .
so , uh , wilson , as i inject air into the n.@@ g. tube .
no , no , it 's a .. good exhausted .
i 've been stuck in this bed ,
and now i wanna be myself again .
ready to get back to my feet and ...
be the doctor i used to be .
i lost myself there for a while . ke@@ p@@ ner .
but now i 'm ready to get myself back .
and it will be fine !
there won 't be enough functioning liver to support this kid .
i think it will , and i will stop before i 'm too deep .
you print one damn fork , and now you think
alex , i am in the middle of dividing this kid 's liver .
and i need this conversation to be over !
oh , you gonna pull rank on me again ?
is that how the decision 's made ?
you could 2
what ?
an alliance between me and the fuc@@ kin ' fbi ?
no , no , between you and me .
i can help you , jimmy , and you can help me .
listen , the whole fucking game has changed .
and i 'm not trying to clean up south@@ ie .
fuck that ! i fuc@@ kin ' love this place .
hey , buddy . got a question for you .
what are you gonna do with the rest of that ?
not drink it .
no , buddy , you got to drink every drop of that . you know why ?
that is pure vitamin c ,
it 's true . go on . put it away .
good boy .
so ...
do you feel like , maybe ,
oh , i remember . something did happen .
yeah ? what happened ?
tim@@ my . he 's the kid who 's always trying to trip me .
and he stole my col@@ oring pen@@ c@@ ils off my desk when my back was turned .
so i pun@@ ched him in the face .
good boy .
jimmy .
hey . let me ask you a question ..
is that why you think you got in trouble ?
all right . i need you to listen very carefully to what i 'm say@@ in@@ '
you got to learn from these things , right ?
here 's the deal .. you did not .
get in trouble because you pun@@ ched this sne@@ ak@@ y br@@ at in the face . not at all .
you got in trouble
jimmy ?
i really don 't think that that 's the right thing to be teaching your kid .
no , that 's absolutely what i should be tel@@ lin ' him , ba@@ be .
so , the lesson you got to learn is this ..
it 's not what you do , it 's when and where you do it ,
you follow ?
yes , i follow .
punch people when no one 's looking .
that 's exactly right .
if nobody sees it ..
it didn 't happen .
well , look what craw@@ led out of the gu@@ tter .
good afternoon , officer fl@@ yn@@ n .
what happened ? i must 've been doing 30 in a 25 .
why don 't you do your fucking job
do your fucking job !
i 'm doing my fuc@@ kin ' job .
i 'm sure the officer didn 't stop us by accident .
you wouldn 't happen to be carrying a message , now , would you ?
in fact , i am .
ger@@ ry angi@@ ul@@ o sends his regards .
says he doesn 't like finding his boys
he also said he 's confident
listen , mother@@ fuc@@ ker ,
fuck you !
close the fucking door .
i got to tell you something , officer fl@@ yn@@ n .
it 's a sad day when a native son takes up with his oppres@@ sor .
there 's a word for that back home , you know .
penalty 's death .
i never trusted fl@@ yn@@ n . he 's a fucking pr@@ ick .
take it easy , will you ?
even as kids , he was a fuc@@ kin ' pr@@ ick !
a fuc@@ kin ' pr@@ ick .
please , calm down .
swear to god , i 'm gonna fuc@@ kin ' kill him .
i 'll fucking kill that fl@@ yn@@ n .
take it easy , will you ?
this is business .
i couldn 't have said it any better .
you 're a liaison . you pretty much do whatever you want .
and no one 's gonna raise an eye@@ brow
there 's just one restriction on our side ...
you can 't kill anybody , jimmy .
kevin , did you know that whit@@ ey was an infor@@ mant ?
no , i didn 't know .
i mean , he hated rats .
we fuc@@ kin ' buried rats , especially our own .
i mean , i knew he had his connections in the fbi .
i knew he had his sources .
but i figured he was playing them like he did everybody else .
but obviously , he had a plan .
where do you get the energy for that shit , jimmy ?
hey , steve . hang on a minute .
we 've known each other a long fuc@@ kin ' time .
can i trust you , ste@@ vie ?
you know you can trust me .
good .
the lottery , jimmy ?
what can i tell you , billy boy ?
i went in on a ticket as a lar@@ k ,
would you say winter hill was thriving ?
we were making a lot of money .
which meant we had to pay off a lot of people ,
local street cops , fe@@ ds , whatever .
we were throwing money around like crazy .
and then there was those trips to miami .
fuck me .
yeah , " fuck me " and fuck you is right .
an hour ago , i got a wet shave in a bar@@ ber@@ shop
jesus , john .
do you want to talk about who 's a valuable asset , charles ?
in five fucking years of
and giving them 40 bucks to go around the corner
fuck that . this , on the other hand
no one else .
jimmy always had a plan .
like him giving up angi@@ ul@@ o 's address at 98 prince street .
now , that was a smart play ...
because it kept conn@@ ol@@ ly , you know ...
off our backs .
we had stuff going on in florida .
situation down there was changing , and not for the better .
roger ?
thank you , alan .
it 's an exciting time for j@@ ai al@@ ai ,
john cal@@ la@@ han has us poised for great success .
i can 't believe people pay to watch this shit .
well , they fucking love it , ste@@ vie .
they fucking love to bet on it . that 's making us very rich .
but who knows for how much longer with wheel@@ er moving in ?
guy 's a fucking double-@@ bar@@ rel@@ ed pr@@ ick .
but at least we still got this .
oh , no , no , no . you give that to kevin , not me .
all right .
so , what 's the problem with this wheel@@ er guy ? what 's his deal ?
what sign did i have that you could change , sto@@ ick ?
that anyone on ber@@ k could ?
i pleaded so many times
this is why i never married .
this , and one other reason .
go on ,
you 're as beautiful as the day i lost you .
could this day get any worse ?
uh , let me see .
we 're gonna jump into freezing cold water
please , ladies first .
you are a ste@@ aming heap of dragon .
take that !
okay , i love you again .
oh , pathetic .
you can still jump .
so , are we going to save your dragons
check every trap .
they 're here somewhere .
me@@ at@@ lu@@ g ?
anyone coming ?
i don 't know , you just keep doing what you 're doing
thank you for saving my life
mom , you 'd never even recognize it .
where we used to make weapons ,
we@@ -@@ we even fix dragon teeth .
you-@@ you wouldn 't believe how much everything 's changed .
aye , your son 's changed ber@@ k for the better .
i think we did well with this one , val
i got it .
i 'll swim and sail on savage seas
will stop me on my ... journey
if you will promise me your heart
and love me for eternity
and i would keep you from all harm
oh , you know , catching up with mom .
that 's your mother ? !
well , now you know where i get my dramatic fl@@ air .
the alpha !
now we have a fight !
show them what you got , bud .
at@@ ta@@ boy !
i 've waited a long time for this .
you cannot take our dragons !
they are controlled by the alpha !
then it 's a good thing i brought a challenger .
another one ?
that is a class ten ! class ten !
okay , change of plan .
no dragon can resist the alpha 's command
t-@@ tooth@@ less , you okay , bud ? what 's going on ?
witness true strength .
the strength of will over others .
in the face of it ,
he belongs to the alpha .
but , please , o great dragon master ,
he will not miss a second time .
it wasn 't your fault , bud .
they ... made you do it .
uh : yeah .
why do you ask ?
you know , we have the extra bedroom ,
oh , my god , that 's so generous !
it 's the least we can do .
what 's going on ?
well , our friend ra@@ i moved into my old room ,
well , what do you think the loss of your room represents ?
bever@@ ly , you know i hold you in high esteem .
can we skip the part where you pretend not to know the answer ,
very well , but , uh , if you don 't mind ,
now ...
you 've recently moved in with dr. fow@@ ler , yes ?
i have .
clearly , your old room represents an escape hatch ,
i hadn 't thought about that .
and don 't start thinking about it now !
hello , amy .
that 's not true !
she said defen@@ sively .
this isn 't about me and shel@@ don .
this is about rai@@ esh moving in with leonard and penny .
interesting .
they 've found a need to take yet another roommate .
seems they 're avoiding some harsh realities themselves .
i had no idea
boy , you 're good .
that is the word on the street , dear .
maybe moving in was a bad idea .
i haven 't been here one day , i 'm already causing problems .
you didn 't do anything . it 's shel@@ don .
that 'd make a nice need@@ le@@ point pillow .
so , relax . we 're happy to have you .
do you actually pay for that hair@@ cut ?
that 'll do it .
hey , raj , i owe you an apology .
look , could you please put your dog on a le@@ ash ?
shel@@ don , she 's fine .
well , then at least hold her still
ra@@ i , i let my emotions get the best of me ,
thank you . i appreciate that .
no , i can 't take all the credit .
bever@@ ly pointed out that i 'm experiencing in@@ securities
what are you talking about ? we 're fine .
yes , you 're fine as long as you have a buffer
it used to be me .
now it 's ra@@ i and his attack trib@@ ble .
anyway , i 'm sorry for everything .
why are you saying we have marital problems ?
we don 't have marital problems !
i see . you must be y@@ elling at me out of wed@@ ded bl@@ iss .
look , just because we took our friend in does not mean
yeah , this is a special circumstance .
shel@@ don mentioned you tried to get your brother
yeah , well , a circumstance can happen twice
do you agree with that ?
well , now that you point it out ..
are you kidding me ?
we do seem to keep finding room@@ mates .
now you 're taking her side ?
dear , i would never come between you and leonard .
that 's for your parade of room@@ mates to do .
howard ?
it 's me ! it 's just me !
what are you doing here ? !
leonard and penny were arguing ...
not on my watch !
it 's fine . it 's just ra@@ i .
you can hit him with the bat , but it 's fine .
and if my heart stops , just let me go .
i 'm sorry , guys .
shel@@ don was upset , leonard and penny were fighting .
i just wanted to go some@@ place where i wasn 't causing problems .
i 'll say it again .
india .

or as i like to call it , world@@ cure .
at the end of the game ,
it should take two to three weeks
by which time , 96@@ ,000 fans
why are you doing this ?
well , think about it .
we have 7 billion people running around
i 'm just trying to make the world
by deleting the surplus .
" cure the world . "
the garbage .

put this in your ear .
jo@@ die , i need you to check for anywhere

no , it 's not .
look who just sat down .
we need to stop her before she sets off the virus .
all right , listen , let 's go around the stadium .
we can 't go around . there 's not enough time .
we need to go across the pitch .
pitch invasion .
too much security .
men and women of gri@@ ms@@ by , listen up .

yeah !
so i ask you to join with us now
let 's put this up , chris .
okay , the smart@@ phone 's connected to the wi@@ -fi . ready .
wait , wait , wait .
beginning to lift the craft .
take the controller .
i want you to notice these marks on my fingers .
all right , cutting off power now .
dude , you 're getting into mit !
these marks on my hand are read
it allows my hands to manipulate this craft
the weather service has issued a tsunami warning
come on , guys . we gotta go !
we gotta go ! we gotta move fast !
we gotta get to daniel 's building
all right , hold on ! we gotta get over it before it cre@@ sts !
come on !
we 're gonna make it .
he 's responsible for the power transfer .
and you know powell .
he 's supervising the security override .
it 's a big job .
perhaps we should call in david baker .
just to be safe .
that won 't be necessary .
we can do this all in-house , huh ?
and sc@@ yl@@ la will be gone by morning .
i promised brad i would call his mom if anything happened .
i 'll do it if you want .
no , it 's okay . i 'll do it .
look at this .
he kept a badge from the police benefit .
when he was a co in fox river .
he@@ -@@ he failed the test to get into the academy five times .
these are right , right ?
this is a map of the company 's basement , right ?
i don 't know . it looks too simple .
i assumed it would be a lot more complicated than this .
the m design@@ ates a meter .
this is some sort of conden@@ sing unit .
this is a plumbing part . it 's called a p-@@ trap .
they 're all completely dis@@ similar items .
logical design dictates they 'd never
it just , um ...
what can i do for you ?
well , i can see that you 're busy ,
sc@@ yl@@ la is moving .
come back ?
don 't worry . we 're gonna stick to our original plan .
what exactly is the plan ?
yes , and if he reaches
if he gets a turtle , well ..
the contractors are here .
what the hell are you doing here ?
you 're a client , huh ?
just keep it down ; keep it down .
it 's all part of the r@@ use .
we need some help . i 'm already
where 's , where 's pretty and the fat@@ man ?
bel@@ lick 's dead .
if you joke about it , i 'll rip your tongue out .
let 's go , lin@@ c .
sorry to bother you ,
he 's in and out of consciousness
i 'd be really grateful if we could see a neuro@@ logist .
does he have insurance ?
uh , yeah .
i don 't have the card ,
just fill this out .
this won 't just serve the rich .
how long have you been working for them ?
too long .
i came in in ' 94 .
i was never good at collecting a pay@@ check .
always freelance .
partially retired all the time .
i like to finish a job and then move on .
put it in the past .
do you always leave your name behind
only on the sc@@ yl@@ la project .
well , we 're considering modifications and ..
come on .
you know what happens ?
they take over your life .
you don 't own it anymore .
that is not what happened to me .
then , somehow you stayed out of trouble .
no , no , that is not it .
look , i can handle this .
i 'm just ..
i 'm just kicking myself .
i could find something else for you to do , okay ?
this thing has gotten way out of hand .
what 's wrong ?
you don 't trust me , fernando ?
why should he ?
because we all want the same thing : sc@@ yl@@ la .
and i 'm not gonna let a giant pack
or would you like me to call the bomb squad ?
look , i am offering to do you a massive favor here .
if that thing blows while i 'm pulling the pin ,
now , don 't worry , fernando .
i 'm known for my steady hand .
take a deep breath , okay ?
keep your weight even .
and i need you to shift slowly ,
oh , no , i can 't ... i can 't , i can 't do it .
are you all right ?
they have to de@@ activate .
i got a key .
a legend to the blueprint .
baker gave you this ? no .
his wife gave it to me . they came for baker .
all right , well , this makes more sense .
these , uh , these symbols
they 're micro@@ phones .
and the letter " v " isn 't for vacuum ,
this is a line of j@@ z@@ 33 land mines
it says , " manual override only .
there 's a manual override .
it 'll cut the power long enough for you
how do you know for sure ?
i found david baker .
su@@ cre . step off .
you can do it . you only have
i can 't ... yes , you can . yes , you can .
michael and i figured it out .
step off right now .
i know you 're kate 's friend , hum@@ ph@@ rey .
but by next spring , she will be a trained alpha ,
no doubt you 'll be a clever om@@ ega .
learn to keep the peace .
and hum@@ ph@@ rey ,
but . but ..
guys , lower the boom !
hum@@ ph@@ rey , we don 't have time for fun .
guys , guys , come on . don 't get your fur in a bunch .

great . my first hunt , and i blew it .
kate , kate , kate , kate , kate .
don 't beat yourself up . that 's crazy . you were amazing .
i mean , if anyone 's hungry , they can eat
they can always eat
they can eat berries .
berries are really nutritious .
yeah . tell that to a hungry pack .
the eastern wolves ruined kate 's hunt .
luckily , the om@@ eg@@ as were there to break up the fight .
so , you think you can do better ?
please .
the next girl that comes up the hill , she 's mine .
i 've never seen her look that good .
kate is hot .
i 'll be right back .
hey .
where do you think you 're going ?
hum@@ ph@@ rey , you know the rules .
you 're not allowed to ho@@ wl with her . she 's an alpha .
we can eat together .
but we can 't , you know , ho@@ wl together .
guys , i know . i .. i was just .
kidding .
cheer up , buddy . you still got us .
friends for life !
we 're going to unite the packs .
welcome back , hum@@ ph@@ rey .
good job bringing her home .
w@@ ow@@ . it 's a big crowd .
yeah . good times .
so i heard you and gar@@ th spent some time together .
lil@@ ly .
sorry .
i 'm sure he 's perfect marrying material .
hum@@ ph@@ rey .
we should be going .
yes , yes .
excuse me . a fle@@ a .
and a little something for your big day .
thank you .
just wanted to say good-@@ bye .
good-@@ bye ?
yeah . i 'm thinking about doing a little traveling ,
and maybe i 'll visit our friends the bears .
our old bud@@ dies , see how they 're doing .
i 'll tell them you said hi .
wait . but you 're leaving jas@@ per ?
yeah . you know , it 's alone wolf thing .
i know hum@@ ph@@ rey , the fun@@ -@@ loving om@@ ega ,
so i 'll be a fun@@ -@@ loving lone wolf .
i don 't doubt that .
did he give you any clues , any coordinates , anything ?
i saw this coming a few years back .
i had a vision . i didn 't wanna believe it .
thought i was dreaming .
tony , i 'm gonna need you to focus .
and i needed you .
as in , past tense .
that trum@@ ps what you need . it 's too late , buddy .
sorry .
you know what i need ? i need a shave .
and when he worked , he talked about his great plan .
even dis@@ assembled , i wanted to please him .
i 'd ask ..
where would we go once his plan was complete ?
and his answer was always the same .
" to the garden . "
so , where is he ?
when than@@ os snapped his fingers ...
earth became ground zero for a power surge
no one 's ever seen anything like it .
until two days ago ...
on this planet .
i was in a place called the quantum realm .
the quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe .
to get in there , you have to be incredibly small .
hope . she 's my , um .
she was my ...
she was supposed to pull me out .
cap .
sorry , buddy , we got a problem .
yeah , we do .
well , what are we gonna do now ?
you know what ? give me a break , steve .
i just got hit in the head with the hul@@ k .
you said that we had one shot .
this was our shot .
we shot it . it 's shot . six stones or nothing .
it was six stones or nothing .
you 're repeating yourself ,
you 're repeating yourself . you 're repeating yourself .
dude . come on !
no . you never wanted a time he@@ ist .
you weren 't on board with the time he@@ ist .
i dropped the ball .
you ruined the time he@@ ist .
is that what i did ?
yeah .
no , no , no , there 's no other options .
there 's no do-@@ over@@ s .
we 're not going anywhere else . we have one particle left .
each .
that 's it . all right ? we use that ..
b@@ ye@@ -@@ bye , you 're not going home .
yeah , well , if we don 't try ...
then no one else is going home , either .
i got it .
we have a potential breach .
i said bring them in .
they 're trying , ma 'am , but brad@@ dock 's unit
oh , for the love of ..
i 'll look at the weather projections .
it 's not lightning strikes we 're looking at .
so , where you at with names ?
what is that ?
that is a long-@@ hor@@ ned bee@@ tle .
nick , there 's something else in his mouth ,
hair . maybe he got a piece of his attacker .
guys , i 'm gonna need some bigger tools .
yeah , okay .
you check the other one , will you ?
yeah , same thing over here .
but these patterns are inconsistent with this bar@@ bed wire .
stop , please stop !
looks like somebody brought chains to the party .
do you see these abra@@ sions and cuts here in the chest ?
they appear to have been made by the bar@@ bed wire .
self-@@ control wasn 't exercised
the place was completely tr@@ ashed .
this is all my fault .
i was the one who wanted to get married at the convention .
where they let anyone in .
all of our friends were going to be here , anyway .
i wanted them to see how happy we were .
let 's go back to
this is a coven@@ s and clans convention .
vam@@ pires , an@@ d. unfortunately were@@ wolves .
mr. stewart ..
may i see your hand , please ?
miss c@@ ren@@ shaw ?
we found the same scar
in the movies , vam@@ pires thirst for blood .
no , but seriously , this might
and .. no returns .
heavy head , curved blade about five inches long .
how many of these have you sold ?
none .
thank you .
um , out of curiosity ...
uh , will you and detective var@@ tan@@ n be
really none of your business .
i had love in my grasp ,
it 's a terrible thing to wake up to every day .
i 'll ... keep that in mind .
your wolf 's in the system .
his name 's timber .
hmm , how original .
timber , here , joined in on the fight .
wolves don 't normally attack humans .
blame the owner , not the wolf .
who 's the owner ?
kur@@ t francis . he 's also in the system .
digestive enzymes .
yeah , someone drank michael wilson 's blood
yeah , kur@@ t francis .
no . it did not come back to kur@@ t francis .
of course ... a vampire .
if we accept the mythology , were@@ wolves don 't drink blood ,
so , what was a vampire
don 't they hate each other ?
it induc@@ es vomiting .
i understand why the were@@ wolves
why would he turn against one of his own ?
maybe michael lost faith .
maybe michael started to see you for what you really are
julie .
you wanted her all to yourself , didn 't you ?
i want a lawyer .
the yellow contact lens
michael 's blood in kur@@ t 's car
but without the murder weapon , we can 't prove
so if kur@@ t and thomas h@@ acked off michael 's head ..
the clothes should prove it .
they should .
you know , there should be a lot more blood than this .
all it proves
well , at the least , they were there .
if they only took one or two swings ,
he was hit with an axe at least 18 times ,
yeah . yeah , another wolf .
or another vampire .
i admit that a black cloak does lend a gentleman
there 's just one draw@@ back ..
it dra@@ gs along the ground and collects plenty of trace .
what did you find , david ?
it 's a flowering herb that only grows above 2,500 feet
we didn 't find any of this stuff at the crime scene .
makes me wonder what else is up there .
we know that michael was running from his attackers .
we know that the chase ended
where did it begin ?
don 't , stop !
your beloved used to be a were@@ wolf .
michael said he 'd seen me at the convention last year .
said he knew we were destined to be together .
so he changed
love built on a lie isn 't love .
you can 't be someone you 're not .
he wasn 't one of us .
and that didn 't sit well with anyone .
did it ?
too late ! no returns !
that was really intense .
well , now we know , next time we go to the farmers ' market ,
oh , good . you 're here . i need your assistance .
can it wait until i put a ban@@ d-@@ aid on a goat bite ?
what happened ?
your buddy got mu@@ gged by some baby farm animals .
been there .
so what do you need help with ?
amy 's mad at me , and i 'm not clear why .
okay . were you talking before she got upset ?
yes .
that 's probably it .
what 'd you say to her ?
well , i just asked her if i should start watching
and that made her angry ?
well , shel@@ don , when you 're kissing a girl ,
it was . i asked her
yeah . i 'm tapping out . leonard ?
i 'm gonna guess that your main concern is the time commitment
oh , no , not just a season .
if i 'm in , i 'm in for the whole run ,
i 'm sorry i 've upset you .
i shouldn 't have asked so many questions .
no , it 's okay .
yeah , maybe it 's good you got us talking about this stuff .
well , look at that ..
even when i 'm causing problems , i make the world a better place .
hey , next , why don 't we tackle your pen@@ chant for wh@@ ining
uh , shel@@ don , i think we 're good for now .
ah , well .. very well .
so does this mean you 'll finally pick a wedding date ?
here we go again .
why is everyone so concerned with us setting a date ?
we 're committed to each other . we 're happy .
a ceremony isn 't gonna change anything .
so you 're never getting married ?
it 's his wh@@ ining , isn 't it ?
it 's am@@ using that he doesn 't hear it .
look , all she 's saying is we are in love
e@@ w , 50 ? we 'll be old and gross .
yeah , but we 'll be old and gross together .
my aunt and uncle were married 63 years .
towards the end , it was like watching cheese melt .
um .. i 'm free tonight .
are you saying you want to get married ?
vegas isn 't that far away .
i 'm in . let 's do it .
after all these years .
i 'm really happy for the two of you .
now get out of my spot .
ber@@ nie , stuart just pulled up .
so remember ,
show no weakness .
right .
good luck .
howard jo@@ el w@@ olo@@ witz , you get back here .
never should have told you my middle name .
hey , guys .
hey , you got a minute ?
sure . uh , let me just put this stuff in the fridge .
i felt bad for finishing your yogurt , so i bought more .
and , howard , your favorite fruit is in season .
crunch berries .
this is a new era for millennium .
i want you all to realize that the only thing
and people refuse to believe that it 's in your mind .
and you can feel it when you go into a room ,
don 't be a child .
plus , he 's wearing a cap .
and ...
he has over two million followers online .
how many do you have ?
what do you want from me ?
i want you to write again .
come by tonight .
i 'm having dinner with my husband tonight .
er@@ ika .
it 's for you .
she 'll be right with you .
i 'm gu@@ essing he thinks you stole this from him ,
that means she moved him to a safe house .
why ?
bal@@ der 's program had a fre@@ ak encryption .
he 's the only one who can open it .
that means these guys are going after him next .
i don 't really see how this makes her any less guilty .
she doesn 't have the monopoly on guilt .
you should be looking for this man , too .
what makes you think i 'm not ?
now , if you will excuse me .
yeah ?
do you know this man ?
he has a tat@@ too like yours .
so are you a cop ?
no , worse .
i 'm a journalist .
that guy , he 's part of this group .
heavy people .
mi@@ ka@@ el .
there were two key stories
the first you couldn 't have written without her ,
i think you are scared
i 'm sorry .
lis@@ beth . i haven 't heard of the spiders .
they sound like the last people on earth
what 's that ?
it 's the answer to " the snow comes early this year . "
so i figure out the big number ,
father said he made his program based on how i think .
you think i 'm a fre@@ ak .
no , i don 't .
get some sleep .

tell me you got the boy .
for now .
i need you to get him back to the u.s .
and make sure that he 's safe .
no , no , no .
i won 't give it up now . think you have a choice ?
what i have is a responsibility to my country .
something somebody like you wouldn 't understand .
i understand how to open that door .
shit .
freeze ! wh@@ oa , wh@@ oa , wh@@ oa !
agree to take the kid back to the u.s. or it stays locked .
would you like a glass of water ?
please get her a glass of water .
he needs to open the program for us .
would you please talk some sense into him ?
fuck you .
i made these just for him .
i will start with this one , the red one .
it will not kill him ,
the black one , though
come on . this thing with julia is young and fragile .
there 's a lot of pressure .
i got us a table at cam@@ po 's .
well , then you better find a sit@@ ter .
i have plans .
